#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Will the Taoiseach comment on the live register figures?  I listened to the Minister of State say this morning that they were down by 12,000 and that this was an indication that things had bottomed out.  The FÁS quarterly economic commentary shows that the number of professionals seeking employment has risen by 84% this year, that one third of men in their early 20s are now out of work and the number of apprentices entering the workforce is down by 60%.  In the year to April more than 18,000 Irish nationals emigrated.  It is clear also that 30,000 people from eastern Europe have returned to their homelands.It seems as if the Government's strategy to deal with the unemployment situation is to switch on the tap of emigration and to facilitate longer stays in education.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?  Will he indicate what is the Government's jobs strategy to deal with a situation where the live register is clearly indicative of a rising emigration trend and, as Deputy English pointed out the other day, we are again faced with the probability of losing an entire generation of young Irish people to emigration?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the figures and indicate what is the jobs strategy of the Government to deal with the issue?

That represents a month on month decrease of 11,200 or 2.6% since September 2009.  The decrease is evident across all nationality groupings.  One takes no great heart from the fact that we have 412,400 people on the headline total for the live register at the end of October.  The unemployment rate is expected to be 12.4%, which is down from the September rate of 12.6%.  When seasonal factors are taken into account the live register for October is estimated at 422,400, which is a month on month decrease of 7,000 or -1.6% since September 2009.  The year on year increase of 162,000 since October 2008 is 62.3% up on that date.It is important to point out that the live register sets out those people who are signing on for jobseeker's benefit and allowance, which comes to a total of 245,000 people.  Approximately 70,000 people who are on short-time work or are doing casual work are signing on for some part of the week.  Then there are people who have cases pending, whose cases have been suspended or who have been disallowed.  They come to a total of approximately 78,000.We have increased by approximately 38% the number of people who have been brought into the employment action plan process this year and more than 55,000 people, approximately half of the people on those plans, have signed off the register.  It is important to note that some of those people have obtained work and approximately 13% have gone into training or work experience.  It is important that we recognise that of the 55,883 people who were just three months or more on the register who were referred to FÁS under the employment action plan to see in what way they could be assisted, a total of 2,200 were placed in jobs by FÁS, 5,000 were placed in programmes, training or education and 20,495 others left the live register.There is a lot of churn, and many people coming on and off the register all the time.  I wish to make those points because sometimes the headline figure for the live register is taken to be the level of unemployment.  The national household survey is the best gauge of employment and unemployment trends in the economy.  Deputy Coveney suggested that cases pending are not included and that one then adds on that figure, which is not correct.  Cases pending are included in the overall figures, so while things are difficult there is no point in exaggerating to make a political point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That is all very fine but one of the big failures of the Government is that it has not interacted directly with the creators of employment and the business sector.  It is perfectly obvious that many of them are struggling in terms of competitiveness, costs of transport and energy, sterling and the difficulties that are placed in the way of creating jobs and allowing business to flourish.  For my part, I intend to take my economic team around the country in the few weeks before the budget to hear their views directly.  The figures for redundancies from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment show that there were 5,888 in August, 6,012 in September and 6,561 in October.  These official figures from the Department show the trend is increasing, while the indications are that when the tax returns come in at the end of November, there will be a devastating situation in which many of those who are self-employed or are employing small numbers of people will be simply out of business.This is the first time there has been a serious return to emigration since 1995.  It is a long time since the late Brian Lenihan said that Ireland was too small for all its young people, and we have no wish to return to the experience of the 1950s or the 1980s when emigration was a release valve.  In any event, there are few opportunities abroad now.  In addition to those redundancy figures and the fact that both IBEC and ICTU have criticised the Government's jobs strategy, the OECD report released today states there is a risk that the high rate of unemployment could be sustained due to a combination of weaknesses in activation policies, which is jargon for a jobs strategy.  The €100 million stabilisation fund is only a drop in the ocean.  I am sure the Taoiseach is interested in finding ways that jobs can be created.  Consider all the young professionals, such as physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and so forth, emerging from university.  The taxpayer has paid for their training and high qualifications but there is no future for them in this country in view of the increasing redundancy rates.We know the Government must deal with the public finances and the banking crisis, and we agree in broad principle with the figures the Taoiseach has given.  However, the central issue is that there must be a jobs strategy from the Government.  Putting people in programmes and placements here and there is only camouflage for the real problem.  What is the main thrust of the Government's job strategy in terms of giving young people hope and confidence that they should stay in this country and that there will be employment for them?  How many of these young people can we expect to see in employment as a result of an environment being created by Government in which jobs can be created and in which they can have the prospect of a job in their own country?  What are the three major points of the Government's jobs strategy to give young people hope and confidence and to ensure we will not lose this generation with their skills, trades and potential to other countries?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The best way to maintain and increase jobs now and in the future is by making the economy more competitive.  We must bring back growth into the economy.  This year there has been a contraction in the economy of 7.5%, which has been a huge challenge to the system.  What we have agreed with other members of the eurozone and what we will set out in our budgetary strategy in the coming weeks will be a preparedness to deal with the deficit, to bring more confidence back into the economy by being prepared to take the necessary decisions now.  These decisions must be taken to promote confidence domestically and externally in the country's preparedness to take the necessary steps that will bring back growth into the economy.  That is the fundamental issue.With regard to activation measures or what we have been doing to try to help people who find themselves out of work, we have taken a number of major initiatives this year.  The number of people on FÁS training programmes has practically doubled this year, from 66,000 to 128,000.  The number of people on back-to-work and back-to-education schemes is approximately 25,000.  We are seeking to assist in a number of areas in the stabilisation programme, which has helped vulnerable but viable firms in this country which supply export markets.  We are facing a further difficulty with exchange rates as the strengthening of the euro against sterling and the dollar is a big problem.  We must continue to deal with that.However, as I said in the House at the beginning of this parliamentary term, the passing of the Lisbon treaty referendum, the enactment of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, legislation and bringing forward a budget are fundamental building blocks for building confidence in our capacity to come through this recession.  In the meantime, we must provide extra places for those who unfortunately have lost employment and, in so far as we can, assist them in retraining and provide upskilling opportunities for them.  That will be an ongoing challenge next year and in the following years.  Yes, an unemployment rate of 12.4% is never acceptable.  We are heading into 2010 when we hope growth will start to return to the economy.  The first full year of growth is estimated, on current assumptions, to be the following year.  However, unless we take the necessary budgetary steps in the weeks immediately ahead, we put at risk our ability to effect economic recovery more quickly.  The failure to take those steps increases the risk of prolonging the period in which growth will not return to the economy for longer than would be otherwise the case.

There are huge consequences for the people who are out of work, including loss of confidence and self esteem and the sense of hopelessness when one cannot access employment.  There are also practical consequences.  They must try to survive on the subsistence level of income which they receive under the social welfare system.Yesterday, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul published its pre-budget submission.  Unlike Government Ministers and some of the hardline commentators who wish to inflict more pain on the poor, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is in contact with people with real problems.  The society reports that there was a 30% increase last year in the number of people contacting the society and one out of every four people contacting the society in Dublin is doing so for the first time.  The society is now housing 560 homeless people per night in its facilities.  It points out that Ireland is the second most expensive country in Europe for food and has the third highest level of poverty.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul concludes that there is no moral or economic justification for cuts in social welfare or pensions.  It asks, in particular, that the Christmas bonus payment for people on social welfare, which was withdrawn by the Government this year, be reinstated.The Labour Party agrees with the society's conclusions.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is no moral or economic justification for cutting social welfare payments and pensions?  Does he also agree that the Christmas bonus payment should be restored?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	While I recognise the wonderful work done by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the moral situation we must face is how we can provide a sustainable level of assistance to people who are on social welfare, based on our current economic circumstances.  If it is suggested that the choice is that one leaves everything as it is because one wants to be in favour of helping those who are unemployed or dependent on the social welfare system as against another crowd, depicted as the Government, who are against people of that ilk, it is a totally wrong choice to put forward.  During the good times we ensured, quite rightly, that people on social welfare received unprecedented increases to assist them.  Anybody who looks at the successive budgets will acknowledge the progressivity in those budgets in terms of helping people on low incomes, working families and people on social welfare.  We are proud of that record.  In the past five years, with inflation of 11.9% since 2004, the basic jobseeker's allowance increased by 37.7% and pensions increased by 51.1%.  It was correct that these increases were granted, particularly in view of the resources available to us at the time.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am interested in providing a solution to this problem which recognises that we must assist the people who are most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible and consistent with a sustainable path forward and a sustainable budgetary position.  If we do not have such a position, we will place at risk our ability to maintain the level of supports we would otherwise be unable to maintain if we do not make the necessary adjustments now.  That is the truth of the matter and people are entitled to know it.They are also entitled to know that we will do everything we can in the context of providing a response to the problem that is as fair as possible.  However, I do not accept the idea that 35% of total current expenditure should remain immune from any consideration whatsoever, particularly in light of the scale of the problem we face.  There is a deficit of 12% and, as previously indicated, an adjustment of €4 billion will be required simply to stabilise this in 2010.  That is the nature of what we are facing.In the past we were able to provide — and rightly so — increases that were three, four or sometimes five times the rate of inflation.  However, interest rates are now lower and, for the first time since 1931, prices are falling.

The Government is not applying the same principle to reducing the incomes of the people who are at the lowest end of the scale.  I refer here to those who are on subsistence incomes.  Due to the fact that they cannot survive on those incomes — which are provided by the State — the people to whom I refer are being obliged to approach charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  These individuals are facing up to the human consequences of the economic problem.When it comes to making a choice, the Taoiseach does not have a difficulty in stating that he will do what is needed in order to protect the interests of people who are very rich and that those who are poor will be obliged to face the consequences.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I do not accept the contentions made by Deputy Gilmore and I wish to make a number of points in reply.  I had a discussion with Deputy Kenny a few moments ago regarding the importance of providing employment in order to avoid the possibility of people's incomes falling.In the budgets introduced in October 2008 and April of this year, we increased personal taxation to a considerable degree in an effort to shore up the position while we awaited a full review of all expenditure programmes.  The latter will form the focus of many of our deliberations in the coming weeks.  We increased taxation but the yield is down and unemployment has risen.  If we move to a higher rate of tax of 54% as has been suggested, the marginal rate will be 63%.  Are people of the opinion that this will assist in maintaining jobs that are already under threat?  Are they of the view that it will ensure that people return to work more quickly?One can make a comment and obtain a certain circulation in respect of it.  However, we face a situation where employment is under threat and where we are trying to improve job security and ensure that the productive sector of the economy can be maintained.  We know that export-led growth in a more competitive economy is the best way of creating jobs, extricating ourselves from the difficulties we are in and creating growth in the economy.  The latter is fundamental for providing money for all public services, including those available to social welfare recipients.  If the locomotive's engine is not running properly, it is not possible for it to pull the train.The idea that there is a monopoly of compassion on the opposite side of the House and that compassion does not exist on this side is not true.  What I and the Government are trying to do is ensure that we can maintain jobs to the greatest extent possible.  Thankfully, there are still, according to the most recent national household survey, 1.9 million people in employment.  I accept that 245,000 people are drawing jobseeker's benefit or allowance on a full-time basis and that 70,000 others are drawing these on a part-time basis.  Approximately €500 million of the social welfare budget is being allocated in order to assist those engaged in casual and part-time labour to retain their jobs.If we recognise that jobs and growth are fundamental requirements and that they must be restored quickly in order to assist us in dealing with our economic problems, then we must be very careful to ensure that we do not take decisions in the short term which will place those jobs at greater risk.  It is false to suggest that we have a choice with regard to taxing one area or not spending in another.  We must examine the overall position and make a decision to retain jobs.

The size of the problem is such that the idea that we can exclude 35% of the current spend from consideration is unacceptable.  There are those who say that the social welfare budget should not be touched, while another constituency is stating that the €19 billion in public service pay and pensions should be immune from consideration.  In such circumstances, we must consider the remaining €15 billion which is used to provide the services on which members of the public depend.  Are people seriously suggesting that we can obtain a €4 billion adjustment out of that €15 billion?  That is not an option.  As a result, we must consider everything.Against the background of our purchasing power this year — during which we increased social welfare payments by 3.5% and which has been marked by an increase in inflation of 4.5% to 5% — we must, therefore——

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	When will the tribunal, which has been ongoing for some time, report?  What is the Taoiseach's estimate of the final cost of the Moriarty tribunal?  Does he know if the tribunal will hold further public hearings?  On the last occasion the Taoiseach answered questions on this matter, it was suggested further public hearings might be held.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will set out the position in this regard.We were told in July 2008 by the Minister for Finance that legal counsel to the tribunal would no longer be paid once public hearings had ceased.  Is legal counsel for the tribunal still being paid?  Has the 8% reduction in professional fees, introduced last year, been applied to counsel for the Moriarty tribunal?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The figure I gave in the primary reply is the cost of the tribunal up to 31 October 2009.  What the final figure will be we will not know until the tribunal has completed its work.I am informed by the sole member that a part-heard witness requires to be recalled and that there is a possibility of a limited amount of further testimony, none of long duration.  As regards the timescale for completion of the tribunal's report, barring matters outside the tribunal's control arising, it is the sole member's intention that the report will be ready for publication in early January.  The 8% reduction in professional fees with effect from 1 March has been applied to counsel for the tribunal.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say that the report of the tribunal will be published at the  beginning of next year.  Obviously, the report will be interesting given the matters under investigation by the tribunal.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that the 8% reduction in professional fees has been applied.  Are legal counsel still being paid and at what rate are they paid?  There must be some estimate of the eventual cost of the tribunal.  I appreciate that the figure up to end October 2009 is €37.72 million.  I presume an estimate is available of what will be the likely final bill.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Obviously, I cannot say what the final figure will be.  However, taking account of what the sole member has said and given the tribunal is coming to an end, whether the final figure will be €38 million or €39 million remains to be seen.Payment to legal counsel has continued on the basis of hearings that had to be undertaken again.  The Deputy will be aware some witnesses were recalled during the course of this year.  In fairness, the sole member, by way of the manner in which he operated the tribunal, ensured hearings were not at all times held in public.  This brought about a saving when compared to other tribunals in terms of costs.  The tribunal's work will be completed, barring matters outside of the sole member's control arising, in January.  The tribunal is drawing to an end at this point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Perhaps I can assist the Taoiseach on this matter.  The recently published Comptroller and Auditor General's report indicates that the final cost of the Moriarty tribunal, including third party costs, will be in the region of €100 million, which speaks for itself.  The cost for 2008 was €4.1 million.  I would like if Dáil committees, properly resourced and empowered, could do this work in future.  Regardless of how cynical people are about their politicians they do like to see them do work on their behalf.  There are previous experiences in the Oireachtas of where this applied.The Estimates for the Taoiseach's Department in 2009 provided a cut of 25% in funding to the Moriarty tribunal.  Has the Department been able to operate within that reduction?  Also, how much has been spent in 2009 to date in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I do not have that specific information to hand but I will obtain it for the Deputy.  The Deputy will be aware that overall allocations are divided between various subheads and should they be exceeded the funding must be made up elsewhere within the Department's overall allocation.On the Deputy's point in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the report was discussed during the course of this year by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Chapter VI concludes that "the potential liability of the State appears, therefore, to be somewhere in the region of €100 million".  This includes costs incurred by other State bodies in responding to tribunal inquiries, as well as third party costs.The report points out that the tribunal drew attention to the downstream gains to the Exchequer arising from its establishment and the conduct of its proceedings.  The tribunal noted from evidence to it in 2006 from the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that as well as specific sums of some €8.5 million recovered from individuals directly connected with the tribunal's proceedings, the tribunal's work has contributed to the cultivation of a new climate or culture of disclosure in financial and fiscal areas.  I believe that covers the point raised by the Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The tradition in dealing with tribunals has been that where appropriate solicitors from the Chief State Solicitor's Office are used.  The Taoiseach will be aware that for the past four years the Moriarty tribunal ignored this arrangement and engaged a solicitor from a private practice.  Can he confirm that the average fee per day was €1,000 and that this amounted to a payment of in excess of €1.2 million for the past four years?  How can this be justified given the tradition has been to use solicitors from the Chief State's Solicitor's Office?The Taoiseach, as an elected representative, will be aware that a person who is inadvertently or otherwise overpaid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs is required to repay that money.  He will also be aware — I have raised this issue before — that a letter sent from his Department to the lawyers of the Moriarty tribunal resulted in overpayment to them of €1 million.  Has that over-payment, resulting from the error in the letter from the Taoiseach's Department, been refunded?  If not, why not?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I have previously answered this question in some detail.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did not refer in this report to the payment as an over-payment.  The letter contained a typographical error and included a figure of €2,500 rather than €2,250, which was the fee per day in the past.  I have dealt with this matter in some detail in response to previous parliamentary questions.As I stated earlier, in fairness to the sole member and given the manner in which the legal team worked, in comparison to other tribunals with similar levels of personnel, the overall cost — we all regard tribunal costs as prohibitive anyway — was less than in other cases. That does not take away from the fact that these are costly arrangements.On the question of the private sector solicitor, in the latter part of 2004 the sole member of the tribunal formed the view that in the context of increased pressures on the tribunal, a solicitor with experience of commercial practice and commercial litigation was required from the private sector, in addition to the tribunal's existing solicitor on secondment from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As the Department wished to avoid the cost of two solicitors, it was agreed with the tribunal that instead of an additional solicitor, the private sector solicitor would replace the solicitor from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The appointment was expected to be of limited duration because of the expectation that existed then concerning the completion of the tribunal's work.  Sanction was obtained from the Department of Finance and a rate of €1,000per diem agreed, which is also the rate paid to solicitors at the Mahon tribunal.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The Taoiseach has informed us the report is expected to be published in January.  We know from reports of all these inquiries, tribunals and so on that once the report is imminent, there is often an attempt to have the report delayed, not published or to have matters excised from it, as we saw in the case of some of the inquiries into abuse.  Has there been any indication to Government from any source of an attempt to prevent the publication of the Moriarty report?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I am not aware of any such attempt.  Obviously, I understand that in the preparation of the report, aspects of it that will affect parties will be brought to their attention and they will have an opportunity to respond.  This is part of ensuring that natural justice is done to everyone in terms of possible outcomes.  However, I am not aware of any detail of that.  I am aware of the general process and procedure that exists in respect of how reports are finalised, completed and published.  The role of my Department in this respect is to facilitate rather than supervise.  I am not involved.  The tribunal is a creature of the Oireachtas and the sole member will report to the Oireachtas.  My role is to try to accommodate requirements as they arise, based on communication from the tribunal to me.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach reported to the Committee of Public Accounts in July that the Government had decided not to enforce the decision to allow for reduced fees to be paid to counsel in attendance at the Moriarty tribunal — a decision that had been announced by the former Taoiseach as far back as 2004 — allegedly because there was a question about the capacity to retain existing counsel and if the decision to introduce the reduced legal fees was made, the prospect of holding on to some of these senior legal practitioners would be severely compromised.  What role did the Taoiseach play in that decision?  He must have played a central role because it was a Government decision as announced by the Secretary General of the Department at the Committee of Public Accounts.How does the Taoiseach justify that decision in the context of the announcement five years previously by his predecessor in this Chamber that reduced legal fees would apply in the case of the Moriarty tribunal?  Would the Taoiseach not have taken the view that it was time to let them sling their hook if they were not prepared to accept lower fees, particularly given that barristers come and go all the time and that there have been a number of senior counsel at different points in the course of the 12 years of the Moriarty tribunal sittings?  Would it not have been better to have faced them down, rather than have capitulated and withdrawn a decision that had already been announced in the Chamber?  Does the Taoiseach not consider it an obscenity that at least two senior counsel over the period of their involvement in the Moriarty tribunal are reported to have earned in excess of €8.5 million each?  This is an incredible figure.  Is the clock still ticking on any or all such costs and is there a prospect of any further public hearings?With regard to the response to the questions tabled today, will the report that is signalled for publication early in the new year be the final report from the sole member of the tribunal and are we looking at closure?  If not, and given the tribunal was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas, do we not have the wherewithal to bring it to a close by presenting a motion before the House?  Can we bring the process to an end and instruct the sole member of the tribunal to present a full and final account of the tribunal's deliberations, hearings and conclusions?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The Deputy has raised a number of points.  Following the July 2004 decision, the Government asked that the relevant tribunals would specify a date by which they expected to finish public sittings.  Having given a reasonable estimate of that time, they were to be told that beyond those dates a reduced rate of fee would come into play.  In the case of the Moriarty tribunal, as events unfolded the envisaged date was extended on two occasions.  The strong view was that the imposition of the reduced rate could lead to the departure of counsel to the jeopardy of the money already expended on the work of the tribunal.  In those circumstances, while the reduced rate applied in new appointments and inquiries, it was not applied in existing tribunals.I am not here as a defender of the cost of tribunals or their duration.  I am here as Taoiseach to recognise that it is the decision of this House that they are set up.  Quite apart from the merit of having tribunals or using them as a mechanism, we have learned from our experience that the House needs to take things slowly before deciding to deal with an issue of urgent public importance in this way in the future.  We have responded legislatively in the House by providing for a statutory basis for commissions of inquiry.  These seem to provide a far more cost effective means by which issues of urgent public importance that require investigation in the public interest can be dealt with differently, while at the same time engaging in the sort of scrutiny and respect for procedures that must be accorded to any citizen, whatever the issue, so we do not do anything prejudicial to people's constitutional rights.  At the same time this would ensure that matters of public interest are inquired into, reported on here, discussed and lessons learned and that policies are changed, amended or modified according to the needs of the day.  These were the practical issues that informed how we were to proceed.With respect, I suggest that had the Government pushed the issue at the time, that might have led to the departure of counsel and many here would have conjured up another conspiracy theory around that, such as political interference with the tribunal or that the Government was seeking to influence the tribunal in some way.  Once a tribunal is established, it is very difficult for the Government to deal with these matters.  I agree it has been open to the House for some time to deal with the issue, but only if consensus is achieved on how Members wanted us to proceed.   Obviously, there are other considerations before we reach that conclusion as well.The lesson that must be learned is that we have provided a legislative alternative to the 1924 Act.  I do not believe as a general comment that matters of urgent public importance should be taking as long as they are taking to come to a conclusion.  I also know that, in many cases, legal challenges, non-co-operation or other issues that arise can cause issues to be prolonged and many detailed investigations and cross-examinations take place.I am not making any prejudicial comment; I am trying to explain that these are the realities as we have seen them unfold.  While we look forward to these reports, and they are investigating matters of public importance the significance of which I do not diminish for one moment, the House must be mindful in the future as to how we deal with issues as they arise in this way and avoid, if possible, a partisan political atmosphere when deciding how to proceed.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Could the Taoiseach clarify what were the influences that made the Government change its mind on the reduced fees in this tribunal's case?  It was a definite statement that was made before the House in 2004.  It had universal welcome and acceptance and it has never been applied.  The Secretary General's remarks in July to the Committee of Public Accounts indicated that it was out of fear that some of these people would not stay in situ to continue their service.  That is not a good enough reason.  Were the waters tested?  Did counsel indicate that they would walk away if lower fees were applied?This is important and we, as Members of the House that established the tribunal, have the right to know.  What influences were brought to bear?  What pressures were brought to bear that forced Government not to proceed with a clear intent as outlined by the former Taoiseach here five years ago?  Would it not be the case that there are many other eminent, able and equally interested senior counsel who would be quite prepared to fill the vacancies and take up the position and bring the process to a conclusion?  We need some explanation of all of that.Will the Taoiseach, for clarity's sake, outline whether the report he has indicated will be presented in the early new year is the finality of the process?  Are we looking at closure?  Is that yet in prospect?  Can the sole member bring the process to a conclusion and will we see finality, with a final report, and will the Taoiseach again confirm that there is no further prospect of any other public hearings?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I have replied to the Deputy regarding a possible further public hearing in respect of a part-heard witness who requires to be recalled.  There is a possibility of a limited amount of further testimony but none of very long duration, according to the information I have.I have explained to the Deputy in respect of the main thrust of his earlier question regarding the possibility of loss of counsel and the impact that would have on the work of the tribunal, etc. — the considerations that came into play in respect of counsel's fees not being reduced in this case.  This is a detailed, technical, complex issue involving those being investigated on foot of a previous tribunal report from Mr. Justice McCracken.This will be, as outlined in the tribunal's terms of reference, the second and final report.  It will deal with those parts of the terms of reference relating to Mr. Lowry and will contain recommendations addressed in the third section of the terms of reference that state that in light of its findings and conclusions, the tribunal is to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Without wanting to interfere in any way with the workings of any tribunal, would the Taoiseach agree that, as this House set up the tribunals, it should be possible to ask either the Moriarty or Mahon tribunal, instead of waiting for a final report on all modules, that the very minimum that should happen is for the results of the inquiry into individual modules be published as they are completed?In some instances, as in the Mahon tribunal, there are people, including myself as a former member of Dublin County Council, who have had to wait 12 or 13 years to have their good names cleared simply because they were asked to attend to give evidence.  It is grossly unfair to any individual that he should have to wait long periods to clear his good name.  The very least that should happen is that as each module is completed, a report on that module should be published.I ask the Taoiseach if this House, having established the tribunals, could ask those involved to publish the reports of each module so that people's good names can be cleared without having to wait for 12 or 13 years.

My Department was involved as usual in the annual commemoration of the Easter Rising at the GPO on 12 April and the National Day of Commemoration at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on 12 July.  In addition, my Department has allocated €170,000 through its commemoration initiatives fund under subhead E of its Estimates this year to support commemorative projects.  This funding is available to assist individuals or groups in organising the commemoration of individuals or events of historic importance.Funding has been given towards the cost of the Mayo Peace Park and towards a publication to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.  Funding has been also committed to commemorate the bicentenary of the birth of William Gladstone, to the Institute for British-Irish Studies, IBIS conference on the plural Protestant traditions in Ireland, to the Royal Irish Academy towards the cost of the publication Judging Lemass and to the National Folklore Collection towards a publication to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Irish Folklore Commission next year.The arrangements for 2010 are still under deliberation.  In addition to events in Ireland, consideration will be given to marking the bicentenary of the independence of Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile and the significant role that Irish-born or Irish descendents such as Admiral William Brown played in their transition to independence.  I envisage that Departments and State agencies will come forward with suggestions for commemorations in 2010.

Ní raibh cruinniú ar bith ag an gcoiste sin ó shin.The Government established a committee to prepare a programme leading up to the centenary of the 1916 Rising prior to the last general election.  There was a request for submissions and ideas from all interested opinion.  Sinn Féin made a submission but there has been no proposal since 2007 to either reconvene or reconstitute the committee.  The Minister for Defence, who has responsibility for this work is beside the Taoiseach this morning.  To the best of my knowledge the committee has not been functioning since 2007.  Maybe I will be contradicted.How soon is it intended to resume the work of that committee?  When will we see full engagement in preparation for that fast-approaching major event?  In the lead-up to 1916 many important events took place here.  In the course of attending to the preparations for 2016 this committee could have addressed other important anniversaries along the way.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have not addressed the centenary this year of the founding of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, ITGWU.  In 1909 Countess Markievicz founded Na Fianna Éireann.  These events were very important in their time and the ITGWU continued to have a significant role in every decade since then, through difficult years and better times, up to the present.I would have expected that this committee would have considered events that led, and were part of the backdrop to, Easter week 1916, in preparing for the centenary.  Will the Taoiseach enlighten us about his attitude to those ideas and when he expects the committee will resume its work programme?  It is not too late to mark the centenary of the establishment of the ITGWU or Na Fianna Éireann before the conclusion of this year and I commend the idea to the Taoiseach.

The Department of Defence has been very much involved in the work.  Submissions have been sought and made.  The Minister will bring people up to date on its work when that meeting resumes.  As one comes closer to the date in question there will be more frequent meetings but that is a matter for the committee to discuss.  I do not want to anticipate what might emerge as a consensus on how we might proceed in respect of related events closer to that date.  It is an important date and a great deal of thought must be given to how we can commemorate not simply its military importance but how we can bring forward ideas for cultural, social and other events that will do justice to the breadth of vision of the leaders at that time.  They were progressive thinkers on equality and inclusiveness in every respect in their era.SIPTU has commemorated its anniversary this year.  It has applied to the commemoration initiatives fund, which is the subject of this question, for a contribution to the cost of publication of the political writings of James Connolly.  This is part of a series of four volumes on his life.  Two were published in 2005 and 2007 respectively.  I am sure that application will receive due and proper consideration.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The committee to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred was an all-party committee established following the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  That arose from concern expressed at the time that the Government's handling of the commemoration was somewhat partisan and that it would be more appropriate that the commemoration be of an all-party nature to reflect the genuinely national nature of the independence movement and all that happened then.  It is important that the committee meet and prepare for the centenary commemorations of several significant events that we will be counting down, such as the 1913 Lockout, the foundation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, the start of the First World War and the 1916 Rising and the various events after that.It is also important that while appropriate arrangements are made for the 1916 centenary commemorations, an eye should be kept to the danger of over-commemorating.  If we have far too many commemorations, there is a danger of commemoration fatigue.  I suggest the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence arrange for that committee to meet so that appropriate arrangements can be made for the centenary commemoration to ensure they are proper and appropriate.  We must ensure the commemorative process has some degree of proportion attached to it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I do not disagree with some of that sentiment.  Commemorations are of most value when they are placed in the modern world in which we live with relevance and that we can learn from them rather than just commemorating the past alone.  It is also important that we do not deny them.  It is a matter for perspective and balance and we must recognise the authentic separatist tradition they represent.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome the family of the late Joe Doyle, his wife Peggy, his children, David, Michael and Róisín, and extended members of their family to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  This is always the conclusion to parliamentary careers.  It is a nice gesture for the Houses of the Oireachtas to pay a final tribute to those who were elected by their respective constituencies and served here.  For every Member here now, some day or other the flag outside will fly at half-mast and someone will stand up to pay tribute to the work they did.It is not always easy to give a picture of the personality of the late Joe Doyle to Members who did not serve with him.  Of the many masses I have attended, however, Joe Doyle's funeral mass at Donnybrook was one at which there was a genuine feeling of warmth and an environment of absolute peace.  There was also a sense of celebration in many ways.  Why would not that be so since Joe Doyle was a sacristan there for 28 years.  It was as if the entire place welcomed him back to send him on his final journey.For those who did not know Joe Doyle, he was a deeply committed Christian.  He was a man of the people who exuded the primary function of public service, that of interest in his constituents.  Wherever Joe was met by people, he always showed his absolute commitment to the people who elected him.Joe Doyle was elected to Dublin City Council in 1979 and continued there until 2004.  He was elected as Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1998 with the help of Fianna Fáil council members.  It was his honour to confer the freedom of the city on Gay Byrne.He was elected to the Dáil in 1982 on his third attempt with Garret FitzGerald as his running mate in the Dublin South East constituency, serving two terms.  I recall the controversial days in the Fine Gael parliamentary party, and the country in general, when the question of a referendum on abortion was being decided.  Joe Doyle had a real, strong crisis of conscience about his interpretation of the wording of the referendum to be put to the people.  At that time he was one of eight party members who voted on a conscientious decision against the wording with the result that the alternative wording was passed by a slim majority in 1983.  Joe Doyle always made the point that his decision on that issue was one for him to decide with his conscience and that he did.He took an interest in the horse-racing syndicate in the House, being a fully participating member.  In his younger years he had an interest in the greyhound industry.  Due to his epilepsy, he never drove and walked around his constituency, a good idea of which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, would approve.  He either travelled by bus or by train and Peggy often drove him around the country on the wild adventures they had on his successful Seanad campaigns.In that sense, he was a quintessential Dub.  Born and bred very close to Donnybrook, he went to school in Milltown and later in Westland Row.  He served 28 years as a sacristan in his local church.  In many ways, he was an absolute contradiction to his running mate, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  Joe Doyle's observations on the high movements of the then Taoiseach were personal and unusual at times.  He had his own way of putting his view across.  It was a pleasure to know him and to have served with him in the House.He hated unparliamentary language.  For people who told stories in which unparliamentary language might have been part, he would either recall them in horror or mock horror.  As leader of my party, I feel his loss is not just to politics but as a role model, the epitome of public service to one's constituents.  Joe Doyle knew all his constituency's streets and laneways and his constituents by their first names, always there to greet them on so many occasions.It is not easy to paint a picture for people who did not know Joe Doyle.  When I listened to his son, David, speak about his father, he put it in a way that no one else could.  He said his father was an extraordinary man of deep faith and conviction, which he was, and had poured out his faith through his actions, which he did.  Joe had an absolute devotion to Lourdes.  He actually proposed to Peggy when he was there once, a story he was always willing to tell.  I listened to David's final words about his father, which I would like to quote as they epitomise the Joe Doyle I knew who served on Dublin City Council, in the Dáil on two occasions and in the Seanad on two occasions, a deeply Christian man devoted to his constituents.  David Doyle put it this way, "Dad, a Dublin man, a Donnybrook man, a church man, a Lourdes man, a Fine Gael man, a true Christian gentleman, my best friend, my father".  He is a loss to his wife and family, to politics, to the people of the constituency and to Dublin, but he set a standard that others can follow in the knowledge that that kind of representation is the true epitome of what public service really is.Tá áthas orm gur chas mé air agus tá súil agam gur thuas sna flaithis atá sé.  Tá seans i bhfad níos fearr aige ná mar atá ag duine ar bith eile mar bhí cúram aige ar an eaglais i nDomhnach Broc le níos mó ná 30 bliain.  Má tá seans ag duine ar bith a bheith thuas leis an bhfear sna flaithis, sílim go bhfuil Joe ann.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I join Deputy Kenny in paying tribute to Joe Doyle who was a true gentleman in Irish politics.  On behalf of my party and the Government, I extend my sincere condolences to Joe's wife, Peggy, and to his children, David, Michael and Róisín.  I would also like to extend sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the loss of a former distinguished colleague.Joe Doyle was a man of integrity, dignity and conviction who first entered this House following the election of November 1982.  That was the last of three elections within 18 months and Joe contested all of them.  During those 18 months he more than doubled his vote, which was not an insignificant achievement when one considers that one of his running mates was Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the then leader of the Fine Gael Party.  Notwithstanding sharing the constituency with such a prominent party colleague, Joe was not overshadowed.  After all, he had been born and bred in his constituency of Dublin South-East.  He knew his area and it knew him.  His father had worked with the Dublin United Tramways Company and the family lived in a house which that company had built for its employees just behind the tram sheds in Simmonscourt Terrace.  I understand the family still lives there to this day.Joe Doyle was very much a man of his community.  Before his election to the Dáil, as Deputy Kenny said, he served as the sacristan in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook for almost three decades.  While he was a Fine Gael stalwart and loyalist, Joe Doyle was also his own man with his own distinct views.  His contribution to the many debates, some referred to by Deputy Kenny, were clear-eyed yet compassionate.  He illustrated his strong beliefs and his practical approach.  He contested his fourth general election in six years in 1987.  Unfortunately he did not make it back to the Dáil then, but he did return, alongside Garret FitzGerald, in 1989 and served until 1992.  In all he contested seven general elections in 16 years and he served two terms in Seanad Éireann.  As an electoral candidate he experienced both victory and defeat, but whatever the outcome he always retained his own dignity.While we knew him as a national politician he also served with distinction on Dublin City Council for a quarter of a century.  No doubt the highlight of his career at this time was when he served as Dublin's Lord Mayor in 1998-99.  His year in the Mansion House coincided with many immigrants coming to this city.  He, as a native Dubliner, was quick to speak out against those shrill voices who did not welcome the new arrivals as they should.In essence, Joe Doyle was a kind and thoughtful man who gave politics a good name.  He served with distinction and integrity.  As Deputy Kenny said, we recall our many encounters with him on this side of the House also, both within and around the environs of the House.  We enjoyed many a day — as Deputy Kenny said, he was a good partner in crime — when we were on the racecourse together.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	On behalf of the Labour Party and my own behalf, I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in expressing our sympathy on the death of Joe Doyle, a former colleague in the Dáil, a former Member of the Seanad, a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and a former city councillor.  I want, in particular, to extend our sympathy to Peggy, his widow, his sons, David and Michael, his daughter, Róisín, their extended family and also to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party.Joe Doyle was a gentleman and he was a credit to politics.  As the Taoiseach said, he was a public representative who gave politics a good name.  He was somebody to be greatly emulated.  He was an outstanding representative for people he represented on Dublin City Council and in his constituency when he served in the Dáil and in the Seanad.I had the privilege of getting to know Joe after I was elected to the Dáil in 1989.  The route I take to Leinster House from Shankill brings me through Donnybrook and when I saw Joe occasionally waiting at the bus stop near Donnybrook church, I picked him up.  Depending on the traffic we had the opportunity to have conversations about many issues.  While we would not have agreed on some of the big social controversies of the day, I found that I had a great deal in common with Joe — his commitment, in particular, to working for people who were less well off, his commitment to his constituents and, most of all, his sincerity .  Everything about Joe Doyle was about a man who was absolutely sincere in what he believed.  He believed in what we was doing as a public representative.  He was absolutely committed in his religious convictions and in his views.  He was a great man and somebody who is a great loss, both to politics and to life.Mar a dúirt an Teachta Kenny, mura bhfuil Joe Doyle ar dheis Dé, níl seans ar bith ag an chuid eile againn.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	On behalf of the Green Party and my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who cannot be hear this morning, I want to pay our respects to Joe Doyle and to extend our sympathies to his wife, Peggy, his daughter, Róisín, and sons, David and Michael.I had the great fortune of knowing Joe Doyle.  I served on the city council with him for five years.  Three thoughts came to my mind when I thought of how I would describe him.  He was a man of standing.  I mean that literally in describing the way he would speak.  He spoke in a clear and proper manner, confident in his honesty and views, even if they were not popular or the views of the day.  He stood and spoke in a way that had real authority and standing.  He was a man of physical stature in how he stood and spoke in a council chamber where I saw him speak.He smiled a lot.  He smiled at his own humour.  I recall one simple incident.  There is a very nice small council housing development in Ranelagh.  He made some quip to the effect that if one got in there, one would have already got to heaven.  He kept smiling after he made that nice quip.  He had a good sense of humour.He was also very successful.  I was the director of elections for Minister Gormley's campaign in 1989.  Joe achieved quite a trick, his constituency was divided between him and Garret FitzGerald.  Joe was very much part of the team but still his own man.  For his party to win two seats in a very tight election was a remarkable achievement.  He was also a successful and capable councillor and Lord Mayor, as I witnessed.  I had the fortune to join the council when he became Lord Mayor.  He worked with the county manager, the council and the officials in an effective way.  One could do a deal with Joe Doyle.  As well as being a man of principle and standing, he also knew how to work and to do what politicians do, namely, to seek compromises and solutions.On behalf of our party, I want  to mark that huge public service he gave and to honour the man.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	On behalf of the Sinn Féin Dáil Deputies and our sole Member of the Seanad, I join in the expressions of sympathy and to convey our condolences to the widow, sons and daughter and extended family of the late Deputy, Senator and councillor Joe Doyle who rose to the eminent position of the honorary first citizen of his native city.I did not have the opportunity of serving with the late Mr. Doyle in any of his varied representative roles over a long period of public service, but I met him on a number occasions and always found him a most pleasant person to speak with in the brief opportunities that presented.  No doubt the reflections of other colleagues here this morning who had the privilege to work with him directly in this and in other chambers is an honest reflection of the true man that he was.  I wish, again, to extend our sincerest sympathy to his family and to the extended Doyle family on their personal great loss, and also to extend to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party our sympathy on its loss as a party.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I was very sad to hear of the loss of Joe in August.  It was the loss of a great parliamentarian, a proud Dubliner, a great family man and a truly wonderful human being, and my sincere sympathies go to Peggy, to David, to Michael and to Róisín, and to all of the extended family.  I was particularly sorry that I could not attend Joe's funeral because I was out of the country at the time of his death, and that was a matter of deep regret to me.I recall Joe clearly from my first Fine Gael meetings well over ten years ago.  What stood out for me was the power and sincerity of Joe's conviction.  He never sat on the fence and he always stood by his beliefs and his principles.  He was an inspiration to me and to all young and aspiring parliamentarians and politicians.  In a world of what is sometimes cynical consensus and political correctness, Joe was not afraid to stand out.His terms as a councillor, as a Senator, as a Deputy and, particularly, as Lord Mayor of Dublin epitomised the spirit of selfless and principled public service which defined Joe Doyle, and my party leader, Deputy Kenny, referred to that eloquently.  He was a proud Christian Democrat in the true sense of that label.  He took principled positions on issues such as abortion and contraception against a flurry of both political and media opposition at the time.  Joe, as always, stood his ground and followed his conscience and many politicians in this House, and, indeed, in other walks of life today, could learn from that.Joe's involvement and his years of service in our mutual parish church in Donnybrook were also a testament to the ethos of public service that he espoused.  Everyone in Donnybrook speaks highly and fondly of Joe and the sterling work that he did for the parish.  Today Donnybrook is a thriving parish with high Mass attendance, and I believe that this is a testament in no small part to the significant service of Joe Doyle in the parish over an extended period, and particularly during his period as sacristan.On a personal level, Joe Doyle was a wonderful mentor and an imparter of wisdom to me.  When I first embarked on my political journey, which eventually saw me succeeding Joe on Dublin City Council in 2004, his encouragement, help and assistance were invaluable to me.  Joe was always available to advise and guide in his characteristically giving and generous fashion.  Joe Doyle was not simply a Christian Democrat but, more importantly, a true Christian.Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I shared the constituency of Dublin South-East with Joe for many years and was on the city council for a period of time with him.  My memory of him, reinforced by the comments that have already been made here this morning, is of an immensely happy, cheerful man.  He could not have been like that all of the time — none of us could be — but he was far more happy for most of us than we ourselves were much of the time.  He had what Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to as this strange sense of humour.  I remember that when he told me inside in the Members' Bar that the reason he did not drive was because he had epilepsy it was a revelation to me, and I asked him how did he survive.  He survived the way Deputy Kenny described, and could not have survived at all without Peggy — Joe was the first to say it.At a time when politicians have been given a bad name by the misbehaviour of a minority, Joe is a model of the kind of person that we would like to see come into politics.  Many people from all sides of this House, including the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, who served on Dublin City Council with Joe would agree that one knew where Joe stood on most matters and one also knew when Joe was ready to do business.  That business was honoured and was never reneged upon.  One could trust it.  One could trust it in the council of City Hall and one could trust it here.  This will, I hope, resonate with everybody in this House.  We all share constituencies with other colleagues, some of whom we can work with.  Some make us nervous.  Joe never made me nervous.  Joe never made any of us in the Labour Party nervous.  We knew exactly where we were with him, and he with us.In particular, Councillor Dermot Lacey, who wrote a wonderful piece in our local newspaper, News 4, reinforced the comment made by Deputy Ryan about Joe’s great moment when he was Lord Mayor and when this city, perhaps for the first time in a generation if not even longer, suddenly experienced an influx of newcomers, as they are called, new people who sought refuge in the city for whatever reason.  There was a resentment, a reaction, a fear, but Joe was not afraid.  Instead, as Lord Mayor, he went to the trouble of ensuring that Dublin City Council would issue information leaflets in the languages of the newcomers so that they would not be lost or become strangers in this city.  We know that newcomers at different generations have provided great wealth and encouragement to this nation, and Joe saw that.  His Christian faith and his Christian Democratic credentials, to which Deputy Creighton referred, informed that kind of action and he reached out to the newcomers as the first citizen of this city.  It is a tribute to him, and it is the epitome of the kind of man he was.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I never served in the Houses of the Oireachtas with Joe Doyle, but I served on Dublin City Council and everything that has been said is so true and accurate.  They say that nice people do not succeed in politics, but in many ways Joe Doyle disproved this cliché.  We all get into politics to make a positive difference and it is safe to say that Joe Doyle made a positive difference.  He made a big difference within his community, within the wider community and within the body politic, which is so important.I was elected onto Dublin City Council in 1999 with Joe Doyle.  He never took advantage of my novice status on Dublin City Council despite my giving him plenty of opportunity to do so.  Joe loved people and loved Donnybrook, and people loved Joe Doyle.  He raised the bar on the body politic, and on standards in politics.  As Deputy Creighton stated, he is an example to all in politics.I wish to express my deep sympathy to Peggy, to David, to Michael and to Róisín.Members rose.

If it is just introduced on Report Stage, there is very little opportunity to discuss it.

There is no such thing as parking it and coming back to talk about it after the event.  We should have the opportunity to address this matter now.  The Order of Business states: "No. a11 shall be decided without debate.”  It should not be decided without debate.  As with all other aspects of the National Asset Management Agency Bill, it should be properly addressed and closely scrutinised.It is wrong that this matter is being presented and we are not being allowed the opportunity to properly address what is entailed in regard to the windfall tax or any other matter pertaining to this resolution which is being put forward.  It should be addressed.  All resolutions that have a financial context require very careful scrutiny and discussion on the floor of this Chamber.  We oppose it proceeding without debate.

The Department of Education and Science stated it wished to bring forward some amendments.  I know it is a slow Department in many respects but can the Taoiseach indicate when it is expected that Committee Stage of this Bill will be taken?  There is much concern among the student community about this matter.

On a second matter, will we deal with the Mental Capacity Bill before Christmas or will that be in the new year?

I want also to raise the issue of the alarming increase in suicides in the first three months of this year, which showed a 43% increase over last year.  The Taoiseach's predecessor allowed for a two-hour debate in the House in Government time.  Would the Taoiseach consider a similar debate?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	115	That is a matter for the Whips.

The front of the Bill states: "Publication expected: Not possible to indicate at this stage."  I discovered that 35 Bills are proposed for 2010, yet there is no status indicated for 21 of them at this stage.  Since progress this year has been relatively poor and since there is very little time left in the legislative calendar, will any special plan be put in place to bring in urgently required Bills, such as the financial legislation to which I referred?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	117	We are working on 20 Bills from the A list in this session and they have priority.  These are the Bills that we wish to deal with first.  There is progress on other Bills that are in the works.

When will this amending legislation be published?  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, is proposing a six month limit for resolving disputes with the PRTB and that is far too long.  It is a significant burden on both tenants and landlords.  Allowing such a long timeline will not solve the problem.

Sa chás seo, tá gach éinne ag caint faoi "NAMA" seachas an "Gníomhaireacht Náisiúnta um Bainistíocht Sócmhainní".  Le tamall de bhlianta anuas, tá an Stáit ag bogadh i dtreo an Bhéarla de shíor.  Tá an leasú seo os ár gcomhair mar nach bhfuil aistriúchán ar an mBille seo ar fáil faoi láthair.  Fiú nuair atá an Acht rite, ní bheidh aistriúcháin ar fáil go ceann tamaill.  Dá mbeadh sé ar fáil againn, bheadh sé soléir do gach éinne gur an Bille agus an Acht ceanann céanna atá ann.  Go dtí sin, ba chóir go mbeimid ag rá go mbeadh an reachtaíocht i gcónaí luaite mar "An Bille fán nGníomhaireacht Náisiúnta um Bainistíocht Sócmhainní 2009".Ba chóir go dtógfadh an t-Aire an moladh seo ar ais go dtí an Cabinet.  Ba cheart go gcuirfimid Billí dhátheangacha os comhair na Dála, chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Níl mé chun moill níos faide a chur ar an díospóireacht rí-thábhachtach seo.  In ainneoin gur cheist tábhachtach í seo, ní hí an cheist is tábhachtaí lena bheimid ag déileáil.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	145	We all know that the purpose of this Bill is, in the Government's view, to fix the banking system and to get it back to some kind of an even keel.  We all understand the need for a functioning banking system.  I would submit that the best way of doing so would be to create a State bank.  The problem with the Government's policy on the whole banking issue is that it is ignoring the broader economy.  The banking system cannot deal with the economic crisis on its own.  Just a few days from now, thousands of people will march on the streets of Dublin in opposition to the Government's proposal to introduce cuts worth €4 billion.  At the same time, this House is debating whether to hand over €54 billion to a banking sector that is neither properly regulated nor as accountable as it should be.  The manner in which this Bill has been handled leaves a significant amount to be desired.  The rabbit was let out of the hat last week when it was announced that an SPV will perform the functions of NAMA.  The Minister has claimed that the purpose of the SPV is to keep the NAMA account off the books.  I am not convinced that the State should operate with such sleight of hand.  There is a need for proper and open accountability.  We should face our responsibilities by dealing with this crisis in an honest way.I would like to conclude by asking the Minister about the properties that are the subject of NAMA.  If NAMA is to succeed, the properties in question will have to return to their crazy values of the past.  If that happens, we will be back in a property bubble.  Therefore, the NAMA gamble is crazy in any event.  As the House is required to deal with a significant number of amendments, I will not use any more of its time by dealing further with this amendment.

Tuigim go bhfuil brú mór ar an Roinn Airgeadais.  Tá sé geallta ag an Aire Airgeadais go mbeidh leagan iomlán Gaelige ar fáil.  Tá sé intuigthe go bhfuil sé sin tábhachtach.  Tá brú mór ar úsáid na Gaeilge, agus ar an Roinn Gaeltachta féin, ag an bpointe seo.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeimid i ndáiríre faoin teanga.  Tá mé sásta glacadh leis go bhfuil stró ag baint leis an leagan Gaeilge a chur ar fáil taobh istigh de ghearrthréimhse.  Ag an am céanna, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an t-Aire agus an Roinn i ndáiríre maidir le leagan iomlán Gaeilge, leis na leasuithe ar fad, a sholáthar chomh luath agus is féidir.  Ceapaim go bhfuil usáid aisteach den bhfocal "fán" i dteideal an Bhille — "An Bille fán nGníomhaireacht Náisiúnta um Bainistíocht Sócmhainní 2009" — neamhchoitianta.

Dá bhrí sin, ní ghlacaim leis an leasú atá molta ag an Teachta Morgan.  Tá sé de nós againn an t-ainm Béarla a úsáid san Alt sin i ngach Bille.  Sa téacs Ghaeilge den Bhille, a fhoilsóidh an Roinn chomh luath agus is féidir, beidh ainm an Bhille i nGaeilge.  Cé nach bhfuil mé i mo shaineolaí sa chás seo, aontaím leis an Teachta Ó hUigínn go bhfuil an teideal casta go leor.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 16, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"2.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, the "Oireachtas Committee on NAMA" shall mean a Select Committee of each House, or a sub-committee thereof so enjoined and appointed by Resolutions of each such House, established with the purpose of monitoring the implementation of this Act, including all acts done in furtherance of this Act.(2) The Committee shall be chaired by a member of Dáil Éireann who is not a member of a political party whose members form part of the government for the time being.(3) The functions of the Committee shall include:(a) to approve or decline the persons to be appointed by the Minister to the Board of NAMA (“the Board”) in accordance with section 19,(b) to approve the appointment of casual vacancies to the Board under section 24,(c) to approve the person nominated by the Chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee on NAMA to the position of Chairperson of NAMA in accordance with section 25,(d) to approve codes of practice under section 34,(e) to approve any guarantee issued by the Minister for debts and/or securities raised under section 48,(f) to approve the form of accounts to be kept under section 52,(g) to approve the appointment and remuneration of an expert reviewer under section 109,(h) to, at the absolute discretion of the Committee, make an appeal under section 119 in the public interest where the Committee sees fit,(i) to approve codes of practice under section 149,(j) to review the operation of NAMA, and develop and publish recommendations for the amendment of this Act,(k) to approve the form, of reports on credit flows and hear evidence on them,(l) to review the shareholders agreement undertaken by the Master Special Purpose Vehicle,(m) to approve the membership of the Valuation Panel, and(n) to investigate any matter of concern to the Committee pertaining to NAMA or to the operation of this Act.(4) The Committee shall have such powers that are reasonably ancillary to the discharge of its functions, which shall include, but are not limited to:(a) to require the attendance of an officer or staff member of NAMA or a participating institution to attend before the Committee and give evidence on such matters connected to the operation of this Act as the Committee may direct, and(b) to require production of any documentation from any person attending the Committee to give evidence under paragraph (a), which is material to such evidence.”.On Committee Stage, there was a broad consensus that the necessary Oireachtas oversight of this body should be much stronger than any oversight we have previously envisaged.  The difficulty with the Minister's proposal is that it envisages that the Oireachtas will oversee the National Asset Management Agency in the same way that it oversees the Health Service Executive, the National Roads Authority and many other bodies.  It is clear that there is growing discontent with the degree of oversight in those areas.  It is much more vital that we should have proper oversight of a body that will spend €54 billion on behalf of the taxpayer.  Investment on this scale has never before been contemplated in this country.The Minister is aware that many people are sceptical about this high-risk strategy.  Equally, many people have significant doubts about the business plan with which we have been presented.  People of great experience have cast enormous doubt on the underpinning of the business plan.  One of the worrying elements of the business plan is the assumption that land and development properties that are currently yielding a 6% performance will eventually yield an 80% performance and thereby repay in full the moneys borrowed in respect of them.  These things are very hard to believe.A sceptical Oireachtas will want to keep a close eye on the activities of NAMA.  Members will want to know that those who are put in charge of NAMA are appropriate and suitable.  We will be concerned to see how they develop NAMA's codes of practice.  The purpose of the proposal before the House is to provide clearly for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee that will ride shotgun on the performance of NAMA, which will be a vital part of the future of every individual in the State.  In our amendment, we have set out the various functions we believe the committee should fulfil.  I have withdrawn some of the elements of my Committee Stage amendment which the Minister rightly argued could be seen to interfere with NAMA's day-to-day management activity.  Instead, I have sought to confine Oireachtas oversight to general policy issues in which it would be appropriate for the Oireachtas to have a role.  The appointment of the board of NAMA will obviously be a crucial issue.  The Minister has said informally that he is willing to engage in negotiations or discussions with Opposition parties on this issue.  While Opposition parties have a role, the Oireachtas has a wider role.  I propose that the agreed group which will emerge from the Minister's consultations should be open to approval by a responsible Oireachtas committee.  As the Minister has indicated he is willing to contemplate such a provision, I hope he will accept this amendment.It is also important for the Oireachtas to be in a position to oversee codes of practice.  Many of the codes that are to be developed will be vital not only in the management of this resource, but also in respect of people who have been brought into NAMA with performing loans.  They will want to see codes of practice that allow them to access borrowings for the purpose of developing those sites.  They have been paying everything and have a legitimate expectation that they will be able to raise finance.  NAMA is not a bank and, therefore, people with performing loans will want to see codes of practice in place to allow them deal with this.  Equally, they will want to see codes of practice that govern all sorts of abuses that could arise.  The Oireachtas has a right to oversee and approve codes of practice under section 34 on the grounds that they will govern how circumstances develop.  The Oireachtas needs to have a role in respect of the types of accounts to be presented on a quarterly basis, as has been accepted by the Minister.The Minister was sympathetic to the view that it is important to protect the Minister by giving the Oireachtas a role in the appointment of members of the valuation panel and of the expert reviewer.  These individuals will be playing a quasi-judicial role in deciding on appeals in regard to the valuation or inclusion of assets within NAMA.  These decisions have financial implications amounting to billions of euro.  The Minister was uncomfortable about being the decider of last resort without clear guidance on the basis on which to make a decision.  He indicated on Committee Stage that he would welcome a role for the Oireachtas, particularly in respect of the expert reviewer and the valuation panel.A vital issue that arose in the debate concerns the master special purpose vehicle, SPV.  The Oireachtas understands why it is being contemplated but does not understand why there is not proper supervision of the activities and membership of the board.  At a minimum, the Oireachtas needs to have oversight in respect of the shareholder agreement so it can be satisfied that agreement protects the taxpayer in the operation of NAMA.  Thus, there would not be a board, controlled by a majority of private interests, in a position to usurp the proper authority of NAMA.  It is vital not only that the master SPV be regulated within the legislation before it is passed but also that the Oireachtas have some role in the supervision of the shareholder agreement and the activity of the master SPV.The powers of the Oireachtas committee will clearly have to break new ground.  Traditionally agencies have bamboozled Oireachtas committees because they have a monopoly on expertise and the assembled information.  An Oireachtas committee dealing with a body as complex as NAMA will have two arms tied behind its back unless it has access to expertise that can inform its questioning and scrutiny of the agency.  It is very much the view of Fine Gael that we need an adviser to the committee of the calibre of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have proposed a monitor from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General who would have access to all the papers in NAMA and who could advise the committee so it could efficiently and professionally scrutinise the agency in its operations.There is broad consensus in the House that an oversight committee is needed.  The Minister appears to be of the view that he will defer the establishment of such a committee until after the legislation is completed and that he will then only do so on the basis of existing powers and terms of reference of the House.  It is very clear that the committee desired not only by those in the Opposition benches but also those in the Government benches should go beyond what is envisaged in the standard terms of reference of Oireachtas committees.  The Oireachtas, through the committee, will need to be able to deal with appointments to valuation panels and the board itself and to challenge inappropriate valuations.  If this legislation is passed without empowering the Oireachtas in this regard, an Oireachtas committee established subsequent to the passage of the legislation will be a damp squib.  It will not have the effective powers required to do the job that consensus in the Oireachtas suggests is necessary.There is no question but that we are breaking new ground and taking on enormous risks.  Many, including me, believe we are going in a wholly wrong direction and that we should be doing something else.  However, we have had this debate and lost it in votes in the House.  It is vital, therefore, that as we proceed, we try to protect the taxpayer in respect of the operation of NAMA.  The Minister agrees to that in principle and I look forward to his backing up his agreement to protect the taxpayer with a powerful Oireachtas committee that can play a genuine role in breaking new ground in overseeing the operation of a body that will be so important to the country's future.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to provide for the appointment of an oversight committee.  This debate on Report Stage is, in effect, the last serious opportunity we have in the Dáil to try, on behalf of citizens and taxpayers, to correct the dreadful flaws in the Minister's proposals for NAMA.  I refer in particular to the decision to overpay for the assets by a factor of at least €7 billion and possibly €11 billion or €12 billion.The Bill does not deal at all with the extra recapitalisation that is likely to be necessary for the two main banks.  The sums involved are likely to amount to at least a further €9 billion to €12 billion.  The Bill does not refer to the recapitalisation of Irish Nationwide and EBS, which is likely to cost €1.5 billion, although the Minister is giving himself the power in the legislation to take a share in those institutions.  No sums are mentioned.The Bill makes provision for some of the largest, if not the largest, financial commitments ever made on a single occasion in a single Bill in the history of the State, yet major amendments are being tabled on Report Stage.  The purpose of the oversight committee is to copy what has successfully happened in other countries where there have been banking crises.  Since the beginning of banking, there have been bank failures.  There is a considerable amount of literature, including historical literature, available throughout the world on how to try to fix a failed, broken banking system.  The key lesson to be learned from recent examples and from history, in so far as Fianna Fáil is capable of taking a history lesson, is that unless there is a high level of transparency and oversight, the whole exercise is likely to prove a failure.One can ask why that is the case.  It is because as soon as bankers get the green light from the Government, the Minister, the king, the emir of the day, they are likely to run back and start to do exactly the same thing that led to the crash in the first place.  That is why we see already that in anticipation of NAMA the banks are tightening up on credit rather than complying with the express purpose of providing credit to small and medium businesses.  They are calling in businesses right around the country to put the thumb-screws on them and make things more difficult rather than less difficult.The Labour Party proposal is for an oversight committee, based partly on the model in the United States and based on the advice we got from people in the Swedish bank rescue, that would report to the Dáil every 30 days.  It does not cut across a possible special Dáil committee but it is different from it and much more essential than such a committee because the purpose of this is to put information into the public domain that not only allows the Dáil to be informed about what is happening in NAMA every 30 days but that would inform citizens, in particular journalists and citizens who are doing citizen journalism on the web and through blogs.  In this crisis it has been so important in this country to have information about what is happening in our name.  I see the Minister, as on the previous day when I mentioned citizen journalism and citizen bloggers——

Thank God we have it in the context of our banking crisis.Why do we not trust the Minister and the Department of Finance on this matter?  Over the summer I requested information under freedom of information legislation on the dealings between the Department and Anglo Irish Bank in the run-up to the crisis in 2008 and up to the date of its nationalisation.  The Minister will recall that Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January of this year, although he and Fianna Fáil had declared previously that it was fine.  In the limited freedom of information documents that I received — because the Department decided to refuse most of the information — one dated 8 January 2009 is a draft to be sent to the European Commission on various Council regulations dealing with banking, says that Anglo Irish Bank is niche market rather than broad market.  That is the Minister's document.The document states also that there has been very close engagement and liaison between the Department of Finance and Anglo Irish Bank on an ongoing basis since it executed the legal instruments to join the guarantee scheme.  It says that Anglo Irish Bank is considered a "fundamentally sound" institution.  That was a matter of hours and days before the bank was nationalised to prevent it collapsing.  The document goes on to state on page 39 that the assessment by Merrill Lynch supports the position that Anglo Irish Bank is "fundamentally sound".  That is a company to whom the Minister told me yesterday he paid €7.4 million in fees to be told that.  If he went up to Doheny and Nesbitt's and had a pint with the drinking economists they could have given him an educated insight into how Anglo Irish Bank was doing for far less than €7.4 million.Hours and days before the nationalisation, page 40 of the document shows, Anglo Irish Bank was considered "fundamentally sound".  The reason I refer to these documents is because they show the thinking of the senior officials in the Department in preparing an important document for the European Commission.  That was the professional advice of a company, which the Minister acknowledged yesterday had been paid €7.4 million for advice on banking and bank capitalisation.  If ever there was a case where institutions of the State needed oversight and information to go into the public domain this is it, not to undermine those institutions but rather for sensible people, whether economists in the Doheny and Nesbitt's school having their pint or ordinary people having a discussion around the breakfast table to be in a position to say: "Hold on, that does not appear entirely sensible to me, that Merrill Lynch, which is being paid €7.4 million should be putting into a document that this bank is fundamentally sound, or that senior officials who are not identified should be writing to the European Commission to say that this bank is fundamentally sound, and more than that, to give an opinion that this bank is niche market rather than broad market."The Minister included the bank in the guarantee on the basis that it was systemically important and he continued to defend that position last week.  It goes to show that someone somewhere in the Department of Finance did have the intellectual insight to say Anglo Irish Bank is a niche bank rather than a systemically important bank.  Yet the type of arrangement——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I was talking to a business person this morning who last year was employing 15 people and this year is employing nine people.  He is desperately trying to keep those nine people in employment.  Similar to the experiences of other business people around the country his bank called him in last week to tell him that they were going to increase the charges and interest rates applying to the facilities that he enjoys from his bank.  In a nutshell, that is why we need oversight.  All of us in this Chamber, including the Minister, are fully aware that banks are putting the squeeze on business in an attempt to recover the profits that they have lost because of the crash and to get their share price up again.  The Minister has told us repeatedly, and we in the Opposition all agree with him, that his objective in this package is to get credit flowing to small and medium businesses.I worked in business before I was a lecturer.  All of us who have worked in business know that that is an extremely challenging environment, no matter who is Minister for Finance.  What we are asking for is oversight because if the Minister gives in to the banks in the way he is proposing to do, as I said previously, the banks will astonish him with their sheer ungratefulness as they literally go back to business as usual; back to the bonuses, the big salaries and to fleecing businesses with banking costs that are way out of line and over and above what people incur in other European countries.The Minister is being the sugar daddy of all times to the banking system and, boy, do the banks know it.  He is in a unique position, as sugar daddies usually are, to ask a favour of the person to whom he is giving all the sugar.  That is what the relationship is.  Instead, nobly, on behalf of taxpayers the Minister is saying he will forgo the insight, oversight and publication of information that will put stuff out there that will help us to get a viable working banking system.  Instead we will retreat behind the old structures of the Department of Finance, which is completely outmoded for this tsunami that has affected the Irish banking system.  New thinking is required.  What we need to do is to open it up to oversight. The establishment of an oversight panel with regular reporting in the public domain is probably the most important thing that can be done to ensure that credit really does flow and that there is some brake or restraint on the banks and bankers returning to behaviour as usual.  The banks can produce all the fancy diagrams and statistics they wish but the reality is they are trying to de-leverage and shrink their balance sheets.  They are also obviously finding it more difficult to get credit-worthy propositions to which they can lend.The main issue is that they are shrinking their balance sheets in an attempt to recover their capital.  If they shrink their balance sheets to the extent they propose, the consequence will be that unless foreign banks come to Ireland and lend to Irish businesses, many Irish businesses and individuals who are good prospects for business or house purchase lending in a depressed market will not get loans.  Can we rely on foreign banks coming back into the Irish market?  I do not believe we can for two to three years.  At present, most foreign owned banks operating in Ireland would prefer to leave this country and sell their Irish subsidiaries.  They have been badly burnt by their Irish experience.  Furthermore, their home countries are telling them, understandably, that they should bring their business back home.  The Dutch and UK Governments want to concentrate their banking bail-out packages on the core business of their countries' banks for their countries' businesses.It will require a deal of courage on the Minister's part to opt for something that is unusual in a small country such as Ireland, that is, the regular publication of information in the public domain.  By all means, bring that information to a Dáil oversight committee but such a committee will be of limited value.  According to the draft business plan and the Minister's subsequent remarks, the €54 billion of loans will be transferred between the establishment date of NAMA and probably seven months later at 30 day intervals.  By the time a Dáil committee is up and running, most of the action will be over.  That is why in the case of the asset relief programmes in the United States the reporting has been up-to-date on a monthly basis.  The Minister said he will provide quarterly information and I welcomed that, but he needs to go several steps further and provide for oversight.The Minister also promised, in response to the Committee Stage debate on this amendment, that he would provide some type of process auditor.  We have seen the elaborate, if not labyrinthine, process diagram at the back of the business plan, but I do not see an amendment from the Minister in respect of the indication he gave the committee.  That, at least, was some additional information but it was not sufficient.  I refer to the elaborate diagram on page 35 of the draft business plan.I intend to press the Labour Party amendment relating to oversight.  I am happy to support the Fine Gael amendment as well but, as I said previously, I do not believe now is the time to establish extra Dáil committees unless, given the importance of this particular committee, at least one to three other committees are abolished or unless this special committee is, in effect, a sub-committee of one of the existing committees, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, the finance committee or the regulatory affairs committee.  Taxpayers will not take kindly to the Dáil basically saying that its response to NAMA is to set up another committee.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has already put forward proposals to reduce significantly the number of committees.  That is in the power of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance but we should not create extra committees unless we get rid of some of the surplus committees that exist at present.That said, I am happy otherwise to support the Fine Gael amendment.  However, it is not enough.  The critical thing is that the Minister must try to provide information to citizens so they can understand what NAMA is about, in view of the fact that the consequences are so long term.  They do not just apply to people who will be working over the next ten years but to people who will be working over the next 40 years.The Minister introduced the special purpose vehicle, SPV, as a clever accounting trick to get the NAMA debt off the country's balance sheet.  That does not fool anybody.  Everybody knows that even though the SPV gets the debt into a footnote to the national accounts, the bond markets, international markets and the EU include it in our national debt and price our debt accordingly.  I do not see the Minister bringing forward amendments to provide for greater oversight and transparency with regard to the special purpose vehicle.  The special purpose vehicle changes NAMA fundamentally and changes the span of control and influence in NAMA to a critical group of investors of €51 million who will have key decision making powers, key oversight and influence and key membership of an inside group in NAMA.  This is all for just €51 million, which is chicken feed to many of the people who operate in international banking.  It is not chicken feed to anybody in the Dáil but it is to international bankers and pension fund managers.In the example in France which the Minister quoted, the people who took the interest in the SPV were the banks who were to be the beneficiary of the French arrangements.  They did it through pension funds, as is likely to happen here.  The Irish Association of Investment Managers, which is heavily linked to the two big banks and Irish Life & Permanent, could come up with that money at a moment's notice.  Why would anybody invest in the SPV?  They would do so if they had a connection to a bank and if it gave them a unique position in terms of control, information, insight and influence.  According to people such as George Soros and other major international financiers, the one item that is prized above all else is information.  To pay €51 million for a permanent inside seat with regard to information on the Irish banking system for a ten year period and to have a good chance of getting that money back is an investment which I believe most operators will not have to be asked twice to make.  While I am referring to pension funds this could also apply to hedge fund and private equity people, who will use that position to play the Irish market in a way that will not be to our advantage.For these reasons, I urge the Minister to accept the concept of an oversight committee.  He must take courage and say to the people who are accustomed to doing business in Ireland behind closed doors and secret bank walls that they should come out into the light and let the people who are meeting the €54 billion debt and providing the guarantee have some information about what is being done in their name.

I will speak to amendment No. 2.  The taxpayers are investing €54 billion in NAMA.  If it was the private sector, the taxpayers, like other investors in that sector, would be effectively shareholders.  They would have access to annual accounts and could attend annual general meetings in order to put forward their views.  They will not have such privileges under the Minister's proposal.We, as politicians, and the Oireachtas are representing taxpayers, by way of proxy, in respect of the €54 billion that will be paid out.  The Minister has nothing to fear — he should embrace the notion — from the establishment of a specific Oireachtas committee to oversee NAMA.  Effectively, such a committee would act in the stead of taxpayers in respect of their investment of €54 billion.  We were elected to represent taxpayers and it is they to whom we are answerable.The committee to which I refer would deal with all the main matters in respect of which taxpayers would like answers to be provided, namely, appointments to the board of NAMA, the code of practice and the appointment of the expert reviewer.  The Minister has taken on board the points raised in respect of the appointment of members of the evaluation panel.  In addition, I believe that, in principle, he agrees that an Oireachtas committee could have a role to play.  The question arises, however, as to whether he will take a leap of faith and — this is a critical point — enshrine such a committee in legislation.We are establishing NAMA in order to ensure that funds flow to small businesses, home owners, etc.  Such funds will act as a lubricant in respect of the engine of the economy.  There must be proper oversight in this regard.  Like us, the Minister has tabled an amendment relating to guidelines for the banks in respect of credit flows.  I am of the view that there is a requirement to adopt the same principles with regard to State investment on behalf of the taxpayer as those which apply in respect of investments made in private vehicles.  Ultimately, taxpayers will be investing in such a vehicle, namely, the SPV.  The majority of the shareholding will be held by private investors and the latter will form the majority of the members on the board of the SPV.  Effectively, there will be a shareholders' agreement in place.  I am of the view that following due consideration, the Minister will embrace the concept of establishing an Oireachtas committee which will be on a statutory footing.The key points relating to this matter revolve around transparency and accountability.  Bank of Ireland released interim financial results earlier today.  The figures were published and the shareholders were able to peruse them, as is their legal right.  The Minister changed the year-end relating to Anglo Irish Bank from September to December, thereby putting off the publication of its figures.  Taxpayers and the State effectively own Anglo Irish Bank but neither has seen any figures since last May.  All of the other covered institutions — AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent — have published interim figures since that date.  There is a need for the Oireachtas to establish what, in essence, would be a super committee which would have the resources to allow it to deal with the issues that arise.  In addition, an official from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be delegated to report to the committee.The Minister has provided assurances regarding the valuation of assets prior to their transfer to NAMA and indicated that such valuation will be subject to scrutiny by the Financial Regulator and under the reporting mechanism of the European Commission.  Amendment No. 2 is reasoned, balanced and progressive and will provide comfort and assurance to taxpayers going forward.  It must be remembered that the money being invested does not belong to the Minister or to us, it belongs to taxpayers.  In the context of the reporting requirements relating to NAMA that are contained in the Bill, taxpayers will not obtain good value for money.Establishment of the Oireachtas committee to which I refer would provide credibility to the NAMA project.  We do not agree in principle with the establishment of NAMA, the work of which will involve overpaying for assets.  We are of the view that this should not happen.  Be that as it may, the Government has a majority and can vote the Bill through the Houses.  However, we must ensure that the necessary structures are put in place in order to protect taxpayers' interests.  The committee to which I refer would be a vital component in that regard.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I support the sentiment behind both amendments.  On Committee Stage, I stated that I would prefer us to take the route of expanding the role of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which could then, in the interests of greater efficiency, establish a sub-committee to deal with this matter.  However, it would be necessary to increase the membership of the joint committee in order to reduce the burden on those who currently serve on it.  A precedent exists in this regard.  The role of the Joint Committee on European Affairs was expanded in order to facilitate the process relating to the Lisbon treaty.  There is no reason, therefore, why what I am suggesting, which might prove more cost-effective, could not happen.I accept, however, that there is a legitimate argument in respect of establishing a dedicated committee to scrutinise the activities of NAMA and that this argument has significant merit.  Some €54 billion of taxpayers' money is to be handed over to an organisation which has not been tested and in respect of which very little is yet known.  Board members have not yet even been appointed.  As a result, it is critical that the highest level of scrutiny should apply.Accountability is essential.  In that context, I hope the Minister will accept the sentiment behind these two amendments.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Section 2 states that the purpose of the legislation is to protect the interests of taxpayers, facilitate restructuring of credit institutions, restore confidence in the banking sector and facilitate the availability of credit in the economy.  These are all good aspirations.  As Deputies Bruton and O'Donnell stated, those of us on this side of the House do not agree with the process the Government has put forward in respect of achieving these aims, namely, the establishment of NAMA.  However, we are democrats.  The Government won the votes on Second Stage and Committee Stage so it seems that NAMA will proceed.  We must, therefore, make do with that with which we have been presented.Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Bruton is a genuine attempt to oversee the objectives of the legislation.  Such provision is not otherwise made in the Bill.  I accept that the Minister will be in a position to oversee matters but the Oireachtas will have no role to play in this regard unless the committee to which the amendment refers is established on a statutory basis.Deputy Bruton referred to the number of existing Oireachtas committees.  Fine Gael would have no difficulty with a reduction in the number of such committees.  In my opinion, the number could be halved.  The reason for the increase in the number of committees has disappeared because the allowances for chairmen have been halved and the allowances relating to vice-chairmen and convenors have been abolished.  The net allowance received by chairmen is now less that €5,000 per year.  Having committees in place does not constitute an expense——

I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance has the interests of taxpayers at heart and that he is endeavouring to do his job in an honest way.  However, he will not be here for the entire duration of NAMA's lifetime.  That is a fact of life.

I have no doubt there will always be within this House sufficient Members willing to be serious members of the committee and behave in a responsible manner.One of the proposed functions of the committee is that it will approve the membership of the valuation panel.  It is likely that membership of the panel will change owing to retirements and so on.  There will be many changes in this regard throughout the period of operation of NAMA.  I do not believe it is any harm to provide for Members of the Oireachtas to satisfy themselves that replacements are suitable persons.  This is not as simple as setting up a panel, reviewing it on the first day and that is it.  There will be many changes.I am sure the directors of the master special purpose vehicle will also change from time to time.  I would like to be satisfied that the shareholders' representatives will continue, in the taxpayers' eyes, to be suitable persons to serve as directors.  Likewise, in respect of the State nominees.  There is nothing but good to be gained from the establishment of this committee.  It will in no way interfere with the day-to-day workings of NAMA or the master special purpose vehicle.  It will, in my opinion, be a source of assurance to the public that somebody is keeping a watchful on all aspects of this legislation.  As I stated previously, there are vasts amounts of money involved in this operation.  There is no reason that on occasion, when the committee deems fit, its meetings should not be held in public session.  This too will provide assurances for people in terms of the oversight necessary in this area.   This should be done in public so that people can be satisfied that matters are progressing to their advantage.I appeal to Members of this House to think positively about the creation of this committee, the purpose of which will be to ensure that the intent of the Act will be borne in mind at all times and to ensure the Oireachtas will have a watchful eye over the actions of the various bodies and associations involved in this process.

I support my colleague, Deputy Morgan, who stated that the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service could be the relevant committee as proposed in amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Bruton.  The terms of reference of that committee could be extended to cover the functions of the proposed committee.  I believe the functions set out are reasonable given the enormous amount of money about which we are speaking, namely, the €54 billion of taxpayers' money that is being committed to GNuBS, which is NAMA as gaelige, although I believe NAMA rolls easier of the tongue than GNuBS.  Also we have recapitalised the banks and may have to do so again in the future.While I accept the list of duties and functions over which the committee should have oversight, I would like to propose others, in particular functions listed in a later amendment in regard to the Minister's regulations.  This is another area that should be scrutinised by a committee of this House given the powers this legislation gives to the Minister.  There should be oversight by the Oireachtas of the actions of the Minister.  Also, the Minister should accept the proposal to establish a committee specifically dealing with the biggest ever single expenditure by this State.  I believe both proposals are reasonable.  If we set up a committee to deal with the vital public interest, the volume of public moneys put to one side to deal with a crisis not of the public's making but of the making of a select few in our society who creamed it when times were good and then collapsed our economy because of their greed, the public will accept that we in this House are doing our job properly.The committee should also have the power to try to influence the policies of NAMA as it goes forward, in particular in respect of the huge amount of vacant properties that will come under its remit and how exactly it should be disposed of.  Obviously, the Minister is minded to believe that the disposal of development land and half built housing estates and apartment complexes throughout the country should result in the highest possible profit, thereby recreating a property bubble, the drastic consequences of which we are now experiencing.  Some of these properties could be transferred, free of charge, to local authorities to address the housing waiting lists and the potential 35,000 home repossessions next year.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, next year 35,000 householders will not be able to afford their mortgages.  A huge number of people could potentially be added to the housing waiting list.  Currently, there are 45,000 families on that list yet we have properties around the country that are vacant and ready for occupancy. In the interests of public policy, we should be seeking to influence the transfer of these properties to local authorities or housing agencies.  The Government rejected our proposal to include the right to housing in the Constitution.  Had it been included, it would have had primacy over the profit motive of NAMA.I urge the Minister to consider the proposal to establish a committee to approve codes of practice and the appointment of various experts to various committees.  The committee could also examine any amending legislation.  The Bill before us, An Bille fán nGníomhaireacht Náisiúnta um Bainistíocht Sócmhainní 2009 — National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 — might be as good as the Minister can provide now.  However, I believe that in a couple of weeks or months — I agree with other speakers that this legislation is rushed legislation — pitfalls will emerge and the legislation, despite my opposition to it, will require to be amended.  The proposed committee could review the legislation when enacted, if the Government gets its way tomorrow, to determine what pitfalls might arise and what type of amending legislation may be required.  This should be done in-house by the committee and will ensure that we in this House have a role in amending legislation to ensure the organisation we have established is operating in the public interest and not in the interests of the property market as proposed in the legislation before us.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 81 together.  The incidence of influenza-like illnesses, ILI, reported on 25 October last is at a rate of 210.9 per 100,000 population.  This is the highest ILI rate reported since sentinel influenza surveillance began in 2000.  There were 2,727 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 on that date.  It is not necessary for swabs to be taken by GPs to make a clinical diagnosis.  The majority of cases are now diagnosed clinically.  At 29 October, 492 cases of confirmed pandemic H1N1 2009 had been hospitalised and sadly ten deaths have occurred.Vaccination is a key strategy being used to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.  Every person in the country will be offered the vaccine.  However, initially the vaccine is arriving in small quantities due to the demand for the vaccine worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in the difficulties we have been experiencing in sourcing the vaccine in the quantities we would require.  Obviously, therefore, vaccination will be prioritised to ensure those who require it most will be first to receive it.  The national immunisation advisory committee and the pandemic influenza expert group have advised that the vaccine should be given to the population in the following order of priority: people with long term medical conditions aged between six months and 65 years and all pregnant women of more than 14 weeks gestation and for women six weeks post partum, — the “clinically at risk” groups; health care workers; children between six months and 18 years of age; adults over 65 years of age; and the rest of the population.It is generally agreed that the preferred option for the administration of the pandemic vaccine to people under 65 in the "clinically at risk" groups is through general practice.  GPs hold their medical records and are in a position to identify patients with underlying medical conditions for vaccination.  It is estimated that there are approximately 410,000 people in this category.  GPs have been receiving vaccine over the past two weeks and many patients have already been vaccinated.  However, not all GPs are in a position to participate in the vaccination programme and the HSE has set up special vaccination clinics to vaccinate the "clinically at risk" patients of such GPs.A full list of the locations and opening times of these clinics has been provided via the national and local media and is available on the swine flu website at www.swineflu.ie.  I have arranged for a copy of this list to be circulated to Deputies.  A typical HSE vaccination clinic will comprise at least one doctor, six nurses and appropriate support staff.  It will have the capacity to vaccinate up to 500 people a day, but the numbers vaccinated at the clinics will clearly depend on the demand from the public for the service.  Staff being assigned to the vaccination clinics will not be replaced and the vaccination programme will, therefore, mean that some other services have to be delayed or curtailed.  The HSE has drawn up plans to prioritise services during the period of the vaccination programme, but the impact on particular services will only become clear as the programme is rolled out.  The intention is to start vaccinating other priority groups, like health care workers and children, as soon as possible.  However, depending on uptake, vaccine supplies and other factors, it could take from six to eight months to vaccinate the entire population.The House will appreciate that this pandemic is one of the biggest public health challenges this country has faced.  The logistics of undertaking such a mass vaccination programme are challenging.  I am confident, however, that the extensive preparation plans which we have in place will assist in meeting this challenge.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	182	If we extrapolate the figures from the sentinel surveillance, we see that almost 10,000 people contract the swine flu per week.  However, these figures do not take into account the people who do not attend their GP and, therefore, the figure may be more like 30,000.  We have a serious situation on our hands.  Some GPs have opted out of the vaccination programme because they believe that even if they do not sign a contract but accept and administer it, there is an inferred contract that makes them liable in law to somebody at risk whom they failed to contact.  Will the Minister comment on that and reassure GPs that will not be the case so that more people can avail of vaccination through their GPs?Hundreds of at risk patients have had to be turned away because supplies have run out or were not delivered.  One-third of the HSE vaccine clinics remain unopened and some at risk patients face up to a 250 km round trip to their nearest HSE clinic.  Some practices filled out the necessary forms last month, but only received syringes and needles.  Practices that received doses of vaccine expect it to run out soon and that has already happened in some cases.  One GP in Edenderry received enough vaccine for only 30 patients and had to use his entire supply by lunch time yesterday.  Another doctor in County Laois only received enough for 60 patients and used that allocation up yesterday.  The list goes on.The HSE has a very poor strategy in place for implementation.  Will the Minister confirm how many HSE vaccine clinics remain unopened?  When will all the clinics be open and what are their opening times?  Will opening times be extended?  Is the Minister satisfied there are sufficient vaccines available to cover at risk patients?  I accept what she said about the supply issue, but what action will she take to speed up the implementation of the programme?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	It is a pandemic and every country faces the same logistical challenges.  Our experience is very much in keeping with our counterparts in Europe and we have had close contacts with many colleagues, particularly those in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.There is no issue with regard to indemnity and this has been made clear to general practitioners, both individually and on the websites of the three insurance companies.  They, Medisec, MPS and MDU have all given assurances that this is normal in general practice and that the doctors are indemnified.  The producers of the vaccine have been indemnified by every country as for obvious reasons they cannot go through the normal processes.  An information leaflet and documentation was sent out to all GPs last month.  This is clear and easy to understand and has been translated into eight languages so that patients from countries where people do not normally speak English can easily understand the what the vaccination programme is about and the possible side effects.We now have 615,000 doses of vaccine in the country.  There is a two-week lag from the time it comes to the port to when it can be got to either a clinic or GP, because of the manner in which it arrives.  It does not come like the traditional vaccine because the manufacturers are trying to get the vaccine to countries as quickly as possible and when it arrives we have to do a considerable amount of work to get it out in ten-pack vials.There are 45 HSE clinics and 32 teams, so some teams will cover more than one clinic.  We hope to have 60 teams in place in approximately two weeks.  On average, each team consists of seven vaccinators, one doctor and six nurses.  Some have more and some less, depending on the arrangements necessary.  Some 83% of general practitioners have agreed to participate, but 17% have not.  I accept there are logistical issues, but there are such issues in every country.  I have spoken to many colleagues who face the same logistical challenges.I appeal to everybody, particularly members of the medical profession, Members of the House, the regulatory body of the Medical Council, all the training bodies, the College of Obstetricians and many other bodies to follow the advice given for all health care workers, doctors and others to accept this vaccination.  I am not a clinician, but I am of the same view.  Significant work has been put into this programme over the summer, led by the chief medical officer and the expert group.  They have done considerable work and have won public confidence.  They have been involved in many public debates on the airwaves, reassuring and informing people.  That will continue to be the case.We anticipate that some 415,000 people are at risk and general practices will get approximately 415,000 vaccines to administer to their patients.  I am aware some doctors have an issue with regard to identifying those patients, but the majority know who they are.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I acknowledge the work that has been done by people such as Dr. Holohan, Dr. Kelleher, Dr. Doorley and others.  By and large they have done a good job.  There are still some GPs who have signed up but who have not receive the vaccine, I spoke to one about half an hour ago.  Can the Minister tell us when all GPs who have signed up to the programme will receive their vaccines?  Those doctors who do not have it yet are getting numerous phone calls and are finding it difficult to say no to people.What is the advice for pregnant women who want to get the mercury-free vaccine?  I understand it is available in the clinics but not with the GPs.I asked about people being replaced in their regular role when asked to work in these teams.  They are taken from their regular work and that is causing problems in some areas.  I was talking to a voluntary organisation that administers some of the home care packages and was told nurses are being taken from those packages.  Is there a system where those people can be replaced if necessary?The Minister said there is a two week lag for the extra supplies once the boat comes in.  Can we get more information about future supplies and when we can expect all of the population to be vaccinated.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	185	We have 615,000 vaccines at present and from their arrival at the port until we can get them to the HSE clinic or to general practice takes about two weeks.  From next week it is hoped to start with infants between six months and four years, preschool children and health care workers.  After that the focus will be on the over 65s and school children, with the rest of the population coming after that.  It could be up to eight months before we get to everyone.  It depends on the take up and the speed with which we get stocks of vaccine.The vaccine is being delivered by United Drug Distributors cold store, which has huge experience of delivering to pharmacies.  There might be issues about when people signed up.  Initially the date was 9 October, extended to 14 October.  Vaccines have gone to 1,500 sites, covering more than 2,000 GPs.  I met the team last night and I understand some doctors will get vaccines today and tomorrow and as quickly as they can physically get out them out, they will do so.I am not in a position to advise pregnant women because I am not a clinician.  The College of Obstetrics has advised on the matter but I would advice pregnant women to consult their GPs for advice.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I wish to clarify something for the Minister.  There is no issue around the medical or legal situation as regards what happens if there are side effects from the vaccine for someone.  The medical, legal problem is that if I as a GP accept these vaccines and vaccinate patients, there is an inferred contract between the HSE, me and the people at risk.  If I fail to contact all those at risk, which I may not be in a position to do, I could be sued by one of those individuals for failure to contact him of her if he or she gets swine flu and develops serious complications.  That is the consideration and doctors wish to be reassured on that point.There was no contact between one of the main GP organisations, the IMO, and the HSE from July until late September.  That is extraordinary, given that GPs were supposed to deliver this.  The Irish College of General Practitioners are acknowledged as the group to speak to about standards and quality but the IMO deals with this sort of logistical problem.  Can the Minister confirm if there was an internal memo from her Department to the HSE not to engage with the IMO?  Can she also confirm that an offer was made privately to the HSE that GPs would vaccinate free of charge if the HSE would organise the clinics and that this offer was not taken up?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The onus is on the individual to come forward to the general practitioner, not on the GP to find the patient.  There is a good relationship between GPs and their patients, although I have heard some general practitioners say they are not in a position to identify the at-risk patients.  That surprises me because we hope that under the new contract for general practice that we will be able to manage chronic illness at general practice level.  The onus is on the patient to come forward.The Department advised the HSE because, given the volume of vaccine that was coming, and the advice of the expert group in August and early September, it had not been decided whether to involve general practice at that point.  That advice was from the chief medical officer and those involved in the arrangements in the Department.  The advice was to engage with the ICGP because it is the standards body while the IMO is the representative organisation and, generally, in matters to do with clinical issues, training and education, the college is involved.We are in a pandemic and the onus is on all of us to work together.  This is a small country and the State has arrangements to procure the vaccine for every citizen in the State free of charge.  If GPs want to administer it free of charge I would be happy to hear it.  If that is also the case for other vaccines we want to introduce, I will be the first to jump on the offer.  The onus is on the patient to come forward, lest there be any doubt.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I am alarmed and surprised that it could take up to eight months to vaccinate the entire population.  That is a long time during a pandemic.  Is there no way to do it quicker?  What about replacing staff?  If the same person is taken from his or her job for that length of time, assuming the HSE clinics will be consistently open, it will have an impact.  In my area there was a suggestion that they would rotate staff and take people from different areas at different times so no area would be short-staffed for a long time.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Vaccination of the entire population depends on the availability of the vaccine, it is not the logistical issue.  We cannot say with certainty when we will have the 7 million doses we have ordered.  The other issue that is emerging is if it will be necessary to have a second dose of one of the vaccines.  If that is not necessary, that will speed the process.  We are in the same situation as virtually every other country in the European Union.Staff will be rotated but when there is an emergency, there must be all hands on deck, as we all appreciate.  I have asked the experts from the HSE and the CMO if they will provide a briefing for Oireachtas Members because many people are contacting me for information and I know they want a briefing session, perhaps early next week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The co-location programme is aimed at freeing up public acute hospital capacity for use for public patients and to enhance overall acute capacity at public hospital sites.The renewed programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.  This means that the procurement process which is underway will continue.  Projects will be developed within the terms of those project agreements which have been signed or which may be signed.  Value for money criteria remain in place and are to be met by each project.Considerable work has been done by the HSE and the preferred bidders despite, in recent times, the effects of the banking crisis on the timing and arrangement of large scale finance for major capital projects in every sector.  Preferred bidders have been selected for the Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional,  St. James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospital projects.  Project agreements for the first four projects have been signed.  Planning permission has been granted in respect of three of these and a planning application has been made in the case of the other project.  The necessary preparatory work for the project agreements in respect of the Waterford Regional Hospital and Sligo Hospital projects is proceeding.The total number of in-patient and day beds proposed in these six facilities is in excess of 1,200.  This is exclusive of critical care beds, which will be provided in proportion to the in-patient capacity in each hospital.  I am arranging to provide the Deputy with a tabular statement setting out the details for each of the projects.  Two further projects at Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals are at earlier stages of the procurement process.The HSE estimates that, from the start of building, the overall construction and commissioning period for the projects will be approximately 28 to 36 months.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I asked the Minister when the projects will start and when the beds will be available.  It is four years and four months since these were announced and the intention was to provide extra beds.  Four years and four months later the Minister cannot tell me when the beds will be ready.  May I have a clear answer instead of all the waffle we are getting?My second question was to know which projects are going ahead.  The Minister indicated that the four for which agreements have been signed will go ahead and Waterford, Sligo and possibly others, Tallaght in particular.  I do not know if the wool has been pulled over the Green Party's eyes but the revised programme for Government states that the Minister will "Proceed with the current programme of co-location limited to already committed projects under the existing project contractual agreements."  Contracts have been agreed in only four projects.  Is it four, six or seven?  Will the Minister be clear and have the Greens been fooled?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I presume the Deputy saw the letter from the Taoiseach to her party leader.  It refers to projects that are signed or to be signed.  The Deputy may recognise that there is a serious financial and banking crisis affecting large projects in Ireland and elsewhere.  We are affected by that.  Private investors carry the risk for all this work.  They must carry the banking risk and get the funding.  I am optimistic that will happen.  From the time that construction begins to commissioning will be somewhere in the region of 28 to 36 months.The Deputy has an ideological problem with this but I invite Deputies to talk to people at St. James's Hospital or any of the public hospitals involved to hear their enthusiasm for this to proceed.  I can quote from a letter from St. James's for example which states that this will allow the freeing up of a significant capacity, equivalent to 21% of its annual hospital admissions.  It will allow the doctors to see all their patients within six hours in the accident and emergency department and all elective admissions to happen within three months, and so on and so forth.There is no other money available to this country to provide additional capacity in our acute hospital system.  The idea is to move private activity from the public hospital so that the public hospital, funded by the taxpayer, can deal with public patients.  It is intended to keep consultants on site instead of having them work in multiple sites around the city, as the letter from St. James's states.  The merits of this are enormous.  The banking arrangements will be put in place.  I hope to see some of these projects proceed very quickly.

If the money had been given to the public system when it was available to build public beds we would have them by now.

I have seen the Taoiseach's letter to my party leader and it is different from the programme for Government.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The programme for Government is exactly the same as the letter from the Taoiseach.  Maybe some people misunderstand that.  Some project agreements have been signed and some involved in negotiations are about to be signed.  The commitments in the programme for Government cover all of those.The issue here is to return our public hospital infrastructure as much as possible to public patients.  More and more of our public hospital activity in recent years, prior to the recent consultant contract, has been private.  That does not make any sense from the taxpayers' point of view or to those who are medically ill and need access to acute care.  I want them to get that access.  The bonus of collocation as opposed to private hospitals 5 miles down the road, which some people favour, is that the consultants, the critical medical manpower, stay on the one site.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Two priorities of the Department in recent times have been the introduction of the nursing homes support scheme, and bringing into force new regulatory standards for the long-term residential care sector.In tandem with these initiatives in the residential care sector, the Department has been progressing initiatives on the community side and, as part of this, commissioned an independent evaluation of home care packages which will be formally submitted to the Minister shortly.  The aim of the evaluation was to assess whether the objectives of the home care package initiative are being met, and this evaluation is a commitment in the Towards 2016 agreement.In addition, two other reports on home care were recently completed.  A report was undertaken by the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, on home care packages.  It acknowledges that while this was a well thought-out policy, improvements are required in several areas regarding implementation, including training and vetting of staff.  A recent consultation paper by the Law Reform Commission entitled Legal Aspects of Carers considers the legal issues surrounding home care.  This makes a number of provisional recommendations in the area of standards and regulations generally, including vetting, training and supervision.  It also provisionally recommends giving a function to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in professional home care.  Any such changes would require primary legislation and detailed stakeholder consultations.The Department accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care generally, whether by public or private provision.  In the context of the independent evaluation of home care packages, and the other recent reports, the Department is, in conjunction with the HSE as appropriate, considering issues such as: finalising and agreeing standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of home care packages; adoption and dissemination by the HSE of a voluntary code of quality guidelines for home care support services for older people; and consideration of the Law Reform Commission recommendations in the context of possible changes to legislation and regulation in the area of home care for older persons generally.

It found that care workers could be sent into homes of vulnerable people with no background Garda checks, many carers were untrained despite being required to look after people with complex physical and medical needs and some private companies admitted they had never been inspected by the HSE to find out if they were meeting the terms.

I can make a free speech with no problem.It is not a question of an evaluation report.  It is a question of putting in place real protection for the elderly and vulnerable in our society.  We have read stories in the press of people being relieved of money to pay for petrol; being asked for loans.  A whole array of things is going on.  I have met some of the people delivering home care and they are also very unhappy.  The HSE is providing these services but not inspecting them.  The history of the HSE in residential care leaves much to be desired and requires to be inspected by an independent body such as HIQA.  When will these inspections, the regulatory body and the standards be put in place so that the most vulnerable in our society are protected and the taxpayer gets value for money?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	206	This initiative is only three years old.  That is why my Department commissioned this review.  We expected that it would pick up problems.  The two reports that I have read, by the NESF and the Law Reform Commission, suggest that two key issues arise, the need for standardisation of access and operations across the HSE and the need for vetting and training and supervision.  We have drawn up draft standards, quality guidelines for home care support.  We will examine these in consultation with all private, public and voluntary providers to bring them in as policy as early as possible in the new year.  Meanwhile, we are examining the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission to bring in primary legislation.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	215	My office has been in negotiations with the Vietnamese Government regarding the drafting of a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement for some time. I have indicated my intention to await the finalisation of the International Social Services, ISS, report on inter-country adoption in Vietnam before making final decisions regarding the next steps.  I will be considering the report along with the report published in August by the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The ISS report should be finalised this month and I will be communicating my decision at the earliest opportunity.  I am mindful of the difficult position many prospective adopters find themselves in at this point.The Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Hoàng Trung Hai recently led a trade mission to Ireland.  I took this opportunity to meet again with him on 23 October — I had already met him during my July visit to Vietnam — and adoption matters were discussed.  The meeting was most amicable and allowed both Governments to outline their current positions on the bilateral agreement and legislative developments in each jurisdiction, including Hague Convention ratification.  Both Governments restated their desire to achieve the highest standards in inter-country adoption and they committed to ongoing dialogue to advance these goals.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Is the Minster of State aware he originally told the House that the ISS report would be published before the end of October after which some form of public debate would be held?  Will he explain why he is now giving a November date?  How soon will it be published?What is the Minister of State's thinking with regard to a new bilateral agreement?  He said there was an exchange between himself and the Vietnamese deputy premier.  Will the Minister of State actively seek to enter into a new bilateral agreement?  Alternatively, has he determined to let the matter stand until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 is passed and the Hague Convention is ratified by both countries?If that is the case, approximately 300 couples and individuals deemed suitable to adopt by the Adoption Board and who intended to adopt in Vietnam will find themselves in limbo.  The Minister of State will be aware of 20 individuals or couples who had submitted all relevant papers to the Vietnamese to effect an adoption but no child has been allocated yet.  No progress has been made in advancing these adoption applications.  Is the Minister of State aware the Adoption Board and the Helping Hands organisation are waiting for some authorisation from him or his office to facilitate these 20 outstanding cases?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Yes, I did indicate initially that the ISS report would be out in October.  However, in the meantime the report has much to say about many receiving countries, including Ireland, and some of those countries had much to say too which delayed the report's finalisation.  I understand it has been finalised and will be signed off by the Vietnamese Government soon.  This report was commissioned with the co-operation of the Vietnamese department responsible for inter-country adoption and its ministry of justice.  Last week, I wrote to UNICEF to encourage the ISS to produce this report as soon as possible for the reasons mentioned by the Deputy.Everyone involved in this issue must have a mature discussion on the report's impact.  There are facts contained in it which are a cause for considerable concern for both the receiving countries and the countries of origin.  These will all have to be taken into account.  The paramount consideration is to ensure the best interests of the child in Vietnam and that the safest possible adoptions can be effected.We must also reflect on the fact that inter-country adoption is a risky procedure.  The writ of this country runs only as far as the jurisdiction.  Going outside to other countries, we cannot know what is happening or whether procedures are being followed to the nth degree.  We must also bear in mind the large number of people with declarations of eligibility and suitability for adoption.  They are frustrated on the one hand by the long time it has taken for them to be assessed and, on the other, that we have had closure with Vietnam again.  Earlier in the year, Ethiopia and Russia closed for different reasons beyond our control.  It is extremely frustrating for parents in those circumstances.I am making strenuous efforts to bring closure to the 20 cases to which the Deputy referred.  It came to my attention during my visit to Vietnam in July that there were 20 dossiers with the department responsible for international adoptions in Hanoi but they had not received a referral.  When a bilateral agreement comes to an end, it is usual practice to allow pipeline cases to be finalised.  We are working to find the correct mechanism to satisfy our laws and the Vietnamese on this matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Minister said facts disclosed in the ISS report, which is in draft form, are a cause for concern.  In so far as those facts relate to the Vietnamese adoption process, why were none of them identified by the Irish Government long ago?Under the bilateral agreement which concluded on 1 May 2009, joint working groups were to be established to monitor inter-country adoptions between Ireland and Vietnam.  Apparently they never met to consider or identify in any detail the difficulties that will be disclosed in the ISS report.Five reported visits were made by officials from the Department of Health and Children to Vietnam and they subsequently furnished reports to the Minister of State.  Why are these reports suppressed and not published and made available to the Library?With regard to the 20 approved cases, it was the understanding that an agreement had been reached with the Vietnamese authorities that would facilitate a child being placed with them.  Will the Minister of State clarify the difficulty that has emerged in this regard?Several individuals and couples have been deemed suitable to adopt in Ethiopia and have been in the process for three years.  They are anxious to ensure the Adoption Bill contains suitable transition provisions to facilitate their completion of the process.  They do not want the enactment of this legislation to put them back to the starting point in effecting their adoptions in Ethiopia.  What will the Government do to address their concerns?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Five visits were made to Vietnam in the past two years during which we endeavoured to get the most amount of information possible.  The withdrawal of the US and Sweden from international adoptions this time last year caused us to visit Vietnam again.  We have been very solicitous in trying to ensure the highest possible standards in adoptions apply between our two countries so as to provide reassurance to those who have already adopted.  They are the people for whom I have much sympathy in this case.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The effect of all these visits was to obtain all the information possible to allow us to make an informed decision.  In the case of Vietnam, the effect of these withdrawals, including our own, has caused the Vietnamese Government to put far greater resources into the issue of bringing itself not only within the provisions of the Hague Convention but also to bring in new adoption legislation.  Different personnel have been brought into this area.Deputy Shatter mentioned Ethiopia and Russia.  It is still our intention to seek a bilateral agreement with both of those countries.  However, as the Deputy pointed out, from the date of the enactment of the adoption Bill, which will shortly go through this House, if a bilateral agreement is not in place, it will not be possible to effect an adoption from those countries.  The adoption Bill will contain a provision on transitional arrangements.  I have met our officials and advisers from the Attorney General's office to discuss those transitional arrangements, how far that process can go and what point one must have reached on the adoption process before one can be allowed to continue to completion, even though there is no bilateral agreement in place and the Bill would have been enacted.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 87, 99 and 122 together.The renewed programme for Government reaffirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme. The procurement process which is under way will continue.  Projects will be developed within the terms of those project agreements which have been signed or which may be signed.It is an essential requirement that each co-location project demonstrates clear value for money to the taxpayer.  There is a requirement on each of the preferred bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for all private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development.  Provided that a co-located private hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure.  I would add that additional revenues will accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.Preferred bidders have been selected for the Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional,  St. James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional projects.  The total number of beds proposed in these six facilities, exclusive of critical care capacity, is in excess of 1,200.  Project agreements have been signed in respect of the first four of these developments and the proposed capacity associated with these projects comes to 917 beds altogether.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Back to front — how does one spell NAMA back to front?Deputy O'Sullivan put the issue succinctly at the outset of the debate on this issue.  Four years and four months have passed and not a single bed has been provided.  Some 21,000 people gave up their health insurance during this year.  The VHI estimates that by the end of next year the number will have increased to 200,000.Co-location projects with signed agreements and planning permissions are entirely dependent on the Beacon Medical Group.  When does the Minister expect the first sod to be turned and the first bed to be available?  How many non-refundable deposits have been paid and received by the HSE?  I ask the Minister to consider that this not only a  flawed but a failed policy.  It has not delivered, by the remotest stretch of the imagination, the fast-track provision of beds.  We know that there are modular units that can be built and put on site in six months.  Approximately three years and ten months ago we could have additional beds if we had not gone down this nonsensical route.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The Deputy is wrong on one point.  The HIA has informed me that 12,000 people have dropped out of health insurance this year.  Out of a total of 2.2 billion, that figure of 12,000 represents a very small number by any standard.  People have switched from one provider to another.  People have left the VHI to take out insurance with some of its competitors.  The VHI may have lost 4%, 5% or up to 6% of its market share, but that business has gone to its competitors.Approximately half of our population has private health insurance and I envisage in that region will continue to have it.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The VHI does not believe that.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	251	It may have issues around its membership, about which it is concerned, but we are talking about the overall market.  As the Deputy has told me on many occasions previously, he is not interested in which insurance company people belong to and neither am I.  Competition in the market has been a very good thing.  During the last recession in the 1980s very few people dropped out of private health insurance and some 37% of the population had such insurance at that time.This policy was enunciated as a way of providing capacity because our public hospital system needs investment.  We need more single rooms to ensure the control of infection in particular.  We do not have resources available to make that investment.  That is a fact.  It does not matter who is in this seat, such resources are not available.Because of the fragmentation of our health service, the massive investment that has taken place during the past decade, in particular, has been targeted at priority areas.  One of the key priorities currently is long-term care where many of our current public stock does not and cannot meet the standards laid down by HIQA.  That must be a priority for public investment.People have opposed this policy from the start.  It is opposed because the funding will come from the private sector.  It was supposed to be the great bonanza for investors.  If it was such a great bonanza , it would have been easy for people to get the money much sooner than now.  There are big risks associated for the investors and that is why the banking situation has not been easy, particularly with the current difficulties.

I cannot look into my heart and tell the Deputy when the first sod will be turned, but I can tell him, as I said in reply to Deputy O'Sullivan's earlier question, the Beacon Medical Group has spoken about this recently and mentioned that it envisages the first facility will be in place in 2012.I understand two or three projects have paid over the non-refundable deposit.  I understand in one case the deposit was €350,000.  When project agreements are signed, the deposit must be paid over at that point.  That is my understanding.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Since the Minister came up with what I can only describe as her disgraceful co-location programme, every time we have raised the shortage of acute hospital beds, she has continually referred to this co-location programme proposition as the means to free up additional public beds in our public hospitals currently occupied by private patients.  Does she recall that when we first engaged on this issue she indicated that 1,000 additional beds would be so created across the public health system?  Does she further recall that when I challenged her in this Chamber in 2007 to indicate the number of beds that would be involved at each co-located hospital, she said she was not in a position to give an answer.  That was her reply.  Is it the case that two years on from that exchange between us in the Dáil that day, not a single square metre of concrete has been poured and as a consequence, not a single further public bed has been created by this project that the Minister holds so dear?Will the Minister agree to call an end to what I can only describe as a very expensive farce on her part?  Will she admit that this never had anything to do with the creation of further public beds but was all about creating further opportunity for those who see health care as a means for creating profit?  How can the Minister justify continuing with this collocation programme when we see a disgraceful situation where children are being denied access to the beds and resources they need to protect their interests, while patients are in Crumlin's hospital for children which only recently highlighted once again——

First, there was never any doubt about how many beds were involved.  If I did not have the information to hand, it was available.  I can give it to Deputy Ó Caoláin rather than waste time.  In Beaumont, it is 157 inpatients, 54 day beds, and so on.  I can give him the information.

If it was the great bonanza for profit makers that he seems to think, they all would have happened overnight.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	266	For the information of the Deputy, UMPC has taken over 40% of Beacon.  It is a not for profit organisation with a considerable international reputation.  I presume most here will be aware of its reputation in the United States and beyond.  Therefore, not all of these projects are being developed by what Deputy Ó Caoláin would call "the profit motive".On capacity generally, we have a fragmented public health system.  If we were to start from a greenfield site we would not put in place what has been in place.  We all know that.  The delivery of quality safe care to patients to best international practice is not possible if one has a fragmented system.Deputy Ó Caoláin opposes everything as being a disaster, but there are many international experts looking at our cancer plan, admiring and supporting it, and seeking to have it replicated elsewhere.

The idea here is to free up these facilities for the public patients.

Some time ago Galway City Council gave permission for a four-storey research facility there which has subsequently been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  Is that considered any part of collocation?Considering that collocation could not even be fitted on the grounds of University College Hospital, Galway, how will this proposed research facility be facilitated there if permission is eventually granted?

It has the new Galway Clinic in place in recent years.  Besides the logistical issues of the university hospital site he mentioned, capacity from the private sector does not exist.

Can the Minister clarify whether Waterford and Sligo hospitals, where project agreements are being prepared, will go ahead with tax breaks?  Can she clarify whether Connolly and Tallaght hospitals, which are at earlier stages, will go ahead with tax breaks?  Was the deputy leader of the Green Party, Deputy Mary Alexandra White, right in stating that most of the planned collocation hospitals would wither on the vine because there seems to be a difference of opinion in Government on all of this?

My understanding is, if memory serves me right and subject to correction, that anyone who has applied for planning permission by the end of this calendar year will be facilitated.  My understanding is that at least one of the projects where a project agreement has been signed will not be availing of tax breaks.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	285	In light of the fact that none of these has gone ahead and there is obviously a major scarcity of bed space at present, which has clearly shown up in what has happen in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where the crisis is desperate, would the Minister reconsider her action where she has closed off so many beds in other hospitals?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I am afraid that is well beyond the scope of the question.  I call Deputy Reilly for a final supplementary question.

On what has happened in Drogheda, Drogheda is following best international practice.  When there is an outbreak of something like C. diff, one closes off a hospital to visitors if that is what is required to make the hospital safe.  That is normal practice.  It does not only happen in Ireland.  If the Deputies read any international press, which I am sure they do from time to time——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	It did not happen by accident.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	298	——she would not have this situation in the Drogheda hospital, which is a hospital that has suffered from many disquieting scandals over the years.After four years and four months — if the Government remains in office the Minister may be in office until 2012 — the Minister has become well known for plans for the future as a substitute for action today.  I have no faith that 2012 will deliver either a sod, a bed or anything else for us in private.  The Minister must acknowledge that this is a poor return for her tenure and in terms of adding additional beds, when there are 700 closed to date due to cutbacks.What real action she the Minister take in terms of the quite considerable health budget available to her to bring about real change in the hospitals to increase our capacity.  We are spending nearly €5,000 per man, woman and child in this country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The Deputy is giving information rather than seeking it.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	300	What will the Minister do about this?  She has told the House that we do not have money.  However, we are spending €5,000 per man, woman and child in this country.  They spend only €3,500 in Holland where they do not have this problem.  They do not even have the hand-washing dispensers in the hospitals, and I asked why.  The response was that they do not have a problem.  They do not have the problem because when the patient is admitted he or she goes into a room and until his or her status, as far as MRSA, C. diff or anything else is concerned, is known, he or she does not circulate in the hospital.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Following the Dáil debate regarding muscular dystrophy earlier this year, I met with Duchenne Ireland and discussed a range of issues, including research, clinical trials, the registry and standards of care for the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  The issues raised by Duchenne Ireland are under active deliberation and receiving detailed consideration at the highest levels in the Department.  However, I must point out that while the Department is working through the various issues raised by Duchenne Ireland, it may not be possible to come to a full resolution of all the issues that are of concern to it.The Duchenne muscular dystrophy registry is a database for patients diagnosed with Duchenne or Becker's muscular dystrophy.  It is hosted by Action Duchenne in the UK and is promoted by Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and Duchenne Ireland.  It is very positive that access for Irish children to the registry has been secured so that they can be considered for inclusion in trials.  While the use of registries as a tool to identify patients for clinical trials is gathering momentum, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy registry is a voluntary database and, as such, it is a matter for each individual to include themselves on the registry.I am not aware of any requests made to the Health Service Executive for assistance to fund Irish Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients travelling abroad for care and treatment in the UK.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The point is that the children going to the UK for trials encounter many challenges and this is not acceptable on an ongoing basis.  There are three key areas: research, a proper register and standards of care.  Duchenne Ireland contends that only a fraction of boys with the condition are on the register.  What is a needed is a dedicated neurologist to drive the updating of the register and to establish the standards.  The Lancet journal will next January or February list a register of standards for all countries with regard to the research and trials that have been carried out.  This register is what will form opinion.  GlaxoSmithKline has already signed a deal to put a product on the market.If we do not have a proper register for the children of this country, they will miss out.  It is estimated there is a core of 150 to 200 boys with the condition.  I ask the Minister in the first instance to dedicate a neurologist from within the current core staff of the HSE to drive this forward.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I have met the group and intend to meet it again in the next few weeks.  I have taken the request on board.  At this point, I cannot say I can deliver the Deputy's request but I accept that because the register is voluntary, people are disinclined to use it, which sends us a message.  If we are to give the register some value, I would hope to be able accede to the request in the near future.  However, I want to meet the group before I give that commitment.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	317	We addressed muscular dystrophy in the House in May of this year, including an address of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  A number of specific areas were identified as being in need of address.  What steps have been taken to progress the needs of people suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and muscular dystrophy generally?  The shortage of neurologists has been highlighted in part, as well as the need for enhanced support for neurology in the national centre, which is Beaumont Hospital, the need for enhanced Government support for Duchenne muscular dystrophy research and, lastly, the need for greater support for muscular dystrophy sufferers, particularly given the outlay they must expend annually in regard to the hire of ventilators to assist their breathing, which is expensive and is not covered by medical cards.  Is consideration being given to extend medical card entitlement to all those suffering from muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	318	First, the extension of medical card cover is not a consideration.  To reaffirm the point raised by Deputy Doyle, I reiterate the importance of a register that would give value.  The issue of a neurologist specifically designated for that purpose is one I am considering.  I would hope to meet Deputies Doyle, Ó Caoláin and their colleagues again in the coming weeks.The point concerning clinical trials arose at the meeting with the representatives.  I pointed out that we have no identifiable lead clinician or investigator willing or able to co-ordinate the protocols of a trial.  Without trying to hide behind that response, the reality is that until such time as we can identify somebody who would take up that role, we are stuck in regard to dealing with the clinical side in Ireland.  As Members will be aware, at the last meeting I gave certain commitments by way of dealing with the need to upgrade and add importance to the register.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	319	We all want to see progress on this issue and I welcome the fact the Minister of State has engaged with it.  The condition affects a relatively small number of people but it would make a huge difference to their lives if we can have a proper register, a dedicated clinician and get them directly linked to the trials.  To achieve this, we need a commitment to be shown on behalf of the Government that we are fully engaged in the process.  We must come back to the Minister of State on this issue.  Perhaps it is up to us to table questions to him as it is important we would have follow-up in this regard.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in this regard.  However, the question is when action will be taken on behalf of those who suffer this life-threatening illness.  Time is not on their side.  Many of the people I met at the beginning of last year have lost their sons.  How many more will lose sons before we take action?  I know we are in a financial crisis but we need to deal with this issue.I want to mention Deputy Joe McHugh, who is involved in this issue and would be present today if he were not on paternity leave.  On a lighter note, perhaps the Minister of State would join me in congratulating Joe and Olwyn on the arrival of young Darragh Thomas McHugh.To come back to the main question, this is a heart-rending issue.  I would like to support the Minister of State and the Minister in trying to find the funds to make this possible for these children.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I meant to mention Deputy McHugh earlier as he was part of the meeting with the Minister, Deputy Doyle and myself some time ago.  I gave the commitment that I would hold another meeting before the end of this term.  I hope that meeting will not be just for the sake of checking where we were at the last meeting.  It is to deal with the issue of the register and, more importantly, to find whether we can secure a lead investigator.I understand 155 boys travel to the UK.  I offer my sympathy to them, but more than just doing that, I will try to deal with the matter.I add my congratulations to Deputies McHugh and Enright.  Indeed, I sent a card to my constituency colleague, Deputy Enright, on the good news.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The EU competent authority in this area is TREAT-NMD, which is based in Newcastle.  It is willing to assist in this regard but it has not yet been engaged with.  Will the Minister of State make contact with TREAT-NMD to request its assistance?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I will.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 112 together.I understand the Deputies' questions relate to the fees associated with the system of registering and inspecting nursing homes which commenced on 1 July 2009.  Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the chief inspector of social services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for inspecting and registering categories of designated centres, including nursing homes for older people.  The authority's inspection process comprises three parts: pre-assessment, the inspection visit and report completion, including a process of fact-checking and verification.  Since July 1, the authority has begun 106 inspections.  Of these, 59 were announced and 47 were unannounced visits.  The average duration of inspection visits to date has been two days.  Of the inspection processes begun, nine have reached conclusion with the publication of reports, along with the publication of one additional inspection report.  The remaining reports will be published shortly.It is important that this new inspection regime is effective, robust, independent and properly resourced.  It was decided that the new registration and inspection regime would mainly be self-financing.  The 2007 Act provides for the following fees: applications for registration or renewal of registration under section 48, where this section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee; an annual fee payable by the registered provider under section 99; and a fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under section 52.  A registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with his or her application.Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places and so on, it was decided to set a registration fee of €500, payable every three years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of €190 per place in each registered centre.  It is estimated that the fee represents an average weekly cost of €3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider, or in the case of applications for registration, by the applicant who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider.  These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.It is a matter for each individual nursing home to determine the price charged for services.  However, article 28 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that:(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged.Therefore, only those fees set out in the contract, including any agreed increases, should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.

One hundred and ninety euro per place is quite a lot of money to an elderly person who has very little left in his or her pension to pay for other extras like chiropody, physiotherapy and other things that may not be covered under the fair deal.  What will the Government do to make those nursing homes not charge that money to their patients?  The Minister of State has just said that under the 2007 Act, only what is contracted for is meant to be charged.  I presume this would not have been in the contract when the nursing home residents came in.  Can the Minister of State clarify that she will tell the nursing home owners not to charge the residents?
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	We have already done that.  It is understood that Nursing Home Ireland advised their members that the fee should be passed on to residents.  This disregarded the obvious intention that the fees should be considered in the context of the National Treatment Purchase Fund negotiations.  The Department wrote to Nursing Homes Ireland in August and October 2009 to advise that as private enterprises, it is a matter for each individual private nursing home to determine the rate charged for services, and that the price set by each nursing home is not determined by the Minister, the Department or by HIQA.When these new fees were introduced, the Minister anticipated that they would naturally be subject to periodic renegotiations to take account of inflation, deflation and other developments.  The Department stressed that this should in no way be taken as an imprimatur for individual nursing homes to invoice their residents with an additional charge on the introduction of the new fees.

A few moments ago, the Minister corrected me when I said that 21,000 people had given up their health insurance, by stating that the figure was 12,000.  I would like her to correct the record.  I have in front of me Question No. 248 on 20 October 2009, which was addressed to the Minister for Health and Children by Deputy Richard Bruton, and the response given by the Minister.  The figure for those on health insurance for December 2008 is 2,299,000, while the figure for June 2009 is 2,278,000.  The difference is 21,000 people and I found it in an answer from the Minister's Department.

It is incumbent on any business to make sure that it can meet its costs.  This is an additional cost to business.  I do not think it will surprise anybody in the Chamber that this will have to be factored into what is charged for the service.  When the NTPF was negotiating its fees with nursing homes, was this fee factored in by both sides?

If it was working, we would not have the misery we currently have in the banking system.  I listened this morning to Deputies suggesting that there are flaws in this legislation.  I suggest to them that we have to look back.  Northern Rock went out of business long before Anglo Irish Bank went bust.  We have to listen to all kinds of stuff in here.  We know what happened to Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns in the United States of America, not to mention AIG in the insurance area.  I watched the experts discussing this issue on last night's "Prime Time".  Where was Professor Lucey five years ago?  He was not to be heard of.  I regret that this kind of thing is happening.  When another bank expert did a sum last night, as if he was in sixth or seventh class, he came up with a few figures to suggest that there will be a loss of €12 billion.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who held up very well on that programme as he clearly defended the Government's position on NAMA.

#NedOKeeffe	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-party	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Yes.  I do not speak in this House very often.  I am astounded that the establishment of another committee has been proposed.  This Bill is the privilege of the Government, which is responsible for putting the law in place.  It does not have to establish another committee.  Governments have always regulated legislation.  This law will be regulated by the Government of the day.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be responsible for it.  Deputy Bruton's amendment proposes that "the Committee shall be chaired by a member of Dáil Éireann who is not a member of a political party whose members form part of the government for the time being".  That is a bit rich, in my view.  It is the privilege of the Government to appoint the Chairman of an Oireachtas committee.  I understand that the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues might have a sneaking admiration for the proposal to establish a committee.  A figure of €54 billion has been mentioned.  This country's two banks — Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks — are having problems with their debts.  I have to say they have stood the test of time on this island and have done a lot for the Irish community.  Day after day, I am told that no money is being made available for small business.When I picked up a newspaper yesterday, I read about the huge food and drink businesses in rural Ireland.  I do not understand how they can be short of money.  According to the farming section of the Irish Independent, small businesses in the food and drink sector increased their imports to £1.27 billion sterling over the last year.  That suggests to me that there is little need for finance.  We should kill the idea that one can lend additional moneys to people who do not have the capacity to repay their loans.  The uncertainty in the financial markets is playing hell with the whole stock market in this country.  I appeal to Opposition Members to be fair and honest in their dealings.  They should not be frustrated about this legislation because it will be a major success for the Irish economy.  I do not doubt that it will put us on a new footing.  There can be no secret about that.

The legislation in those areas needs to be tightened up if we are to save them.  I have been making the point that the private sector has a lot to answer for, especially in the auditing area, but nobody seems to want to listen to it.  Audit committees and all sorts of remuneration committees are being established as part of the boards of banks and other organisations, but no proper policing or reporting back is being done.  The weakest people — the friends of the managers — are being put on the audit committees.  Regulations need to be put in place to ensure that such people have to report back to a full meeting of the board in its entirety.  I would like to make the point that the stronger people who are on the board might not be on the average committee.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with the issues in the banks.  What is the reason for the delay in appointing a new chief executive of Allied Irish Banks?  I am asking that question because there is uncertainty in the banking system.  What is wrong with Irish men and women that they are not getting these jobs?  Why do we have to go outside the country to get people?  We have the finest educated people in the world in this country.  They are quite competent in every area, including the financial area.  I do not understand why we have to go abroad to get people to set up business here.  If there is a general election next year, will we have to go abroad to get people to stand in the various constituencies, on the basis that foreigners have more to contribute than Irish men and women?  If we had depended on foreigners to free this island in 1916 and in the 1920s, Ireland would still be an alien country that is controlled from outside.  It is about time for us to stand up for and defend our own people.  The nonsense has to stop.  If we have no one here, how can we go abroad and say we have something to offer?  It is very important that these points are made.

All they can do is burst and give out about Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  What about the foreign banks that came here to create competition, but instead put us in the position we are now in?  None of those banks is giving out money to small businesses and small people.  Those who are blaming the two Irish banks, which are part of our heritage and our great success in life and have branches throughout the country, are forgetting about banks like National Irish Bank, which is owned by Danske Bank, and ACCBank, which is part of Rabobank.

I say "well done" to the Minister.  He should be allowed to get on with his business of getting this legislation right and getting it through.  We have the support of EUROSTAT, the European Central Bank, much of the Irish business community and many well-heeled economists who understand business.  A few Members of this House are on the sideline.  The bank expert who spoke on television last night suggested that NAMA will make a loss of €12 billion.  If he had drawn up his figures on the side of a cigarette box, he would have come up with the same thing.  The Minister has the full support of the House.  He should not mind the frustrations of the Opposition.  He should get on with the business of putting this country back on its feet.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I will try to be brief.  Deputy Edward O'Keeffe's speech should do wonders for share prices.  If it does not, we have just no hope at all.  I would like to focus specifically on the amendments before the House.  When I attended last evening's launch of a book written by Senator Ross, I learned about the packages that were negotiated by some of the people at the tops of the banks.  It seems that some of those referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe were far less influenced by heritage than by their views of appropriate compensation.  They decided they needed €1 million a year, or sweeteners for the future in terms of options.  My Labour Party colleague, Deputy Burton, has said that although we will support amendment No. 2, we regard amendment No. 4 as more important because it will provide the transparency that is needed.  Now that Second Stage has been passed, Committee Stage has been discussed and some changes have been promised, Deputies on all sides of the House agree that we want the legislation to be as good as possible.  I thought the Minister for Finance had accepted on Committee Stage that there is a need for a significant change in culture.  I hope I was not mistaken in placing my belief in that.  Such a change is absolutely essential.  We could not go on as we were.I wish to pick up on the comments made by Deputy Burton when she quoted from material she received on foot of a freedom of information request.  It is clear that PricewaterhouseCoopers worked as a financial consultant to the Financial Regulator, which let us down.  In its own communication, Merrill Lynch described itself as a financial adviser to the Department of Finance.  It is plain that both companies, which were rewarded over the rate, let us down.  A communication between the Government and the European Central Bank, which has been mentioned, stated that the Governor of the Central Bank believed that Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance.  That is also disgraceful.I want to make clear where the oversight committee and the Oireachtas committee are required.  What is at stake is a degree of vigilance, accuracy of information and commitment to the public interest that did not exist heretofore.  With regard to the two committees, one should note there is across the water an interesting discussion taking place on Professor Nutt's relationship to the British Cabinet as an expert adviser.  Later amendments will cover gagging as it arises in respect of the role of an independent, intellectual, public-interest voice.  In the case of Professor Nutt, it is suggested that, under the Westminster model, the British Government practically owns the mind of the person involved.  What we now need is an entirely different approach to transparency and the question of expert advice.Amendment No. 4 concerns an extremely important topic, the oversight committee.  Deputy Edward O'Keeffe is at least straightforward about what he is suggesting, that is, that the committee be the Government's committee.  According to the legislation, unless we amend it, not only will it be the Government's committee but the Government's committee with the neutered expert.  The expert will be neutered in so far as he will not be free to express an opinion.  If ever there were proof of the need for independent public-interest-driven people, this is it.  I refer to people who know the complex structure of financial markets but who are free to express their opinion.  This is needed urgently in regard to the provision of information in the public interest through an oversight committee and in a policy sense with a view to discussing whether one is achieving liquidity, which everyone agrees is necessary.  It is needed in respect of the Oireachtas committee.  However, one cannot achieve this if committees are structured as they are at present.I will leave for another day the flaw in our legislative process whereby the Government has a monopoly on the right to introduce legislation.  We would be better served by the Scandinavian model, under which significant committees have blocks of expenditure and are transparent and accountable.  Not only can such committees change legislation and make it accountable, they can also introduce it.  We are paying a high price for our very old, undemocratic, unaccountable form of decision-making.  However, we have what we have in this regard.The Minister agreed in his reply on Second and Committee Stages there was a need for a break with the past.  Consider the circumstances if one does not break with the past and continues to allocate €240 million per year for the purchase of expert opinion.  We must ask whether it is not in the public interest to know how we have operated in the past.  We paid €7.4 million to Merrill Lynch to tell us Anglo Irish Bank was sound when it clearly was not.  Equally, the Governor of the Central Bank provided a letter to state Anglo Irish Bank was of systemic importance.  This provokes a theological debate on how a bank can be a niche bank.  By this I mean a person deals with a particular person in Anglo Irish Bank in respect of a particular project and is coached on how to go forward with his speculation, be it national or international.  How can a bank do this and be a systemic bank?  A bank can only be a systemic bank according to such a theological argument if one says the entire system is speculative, unaccountable and going down the Suwannee, as our system very much nearly did.  Anglo Irish Bank was never of systemic importance.  It was a disastrous mistake to include it in the guarantee, from which we have been seeking to recover.With regard to oversight, one needs to use both committees in a way that will make a significant break with the culture of negligence.  The various people responsible have gone away into the sunset.  What they did in regard to the banking system was appalling.  If we are to envisage consultancy fees of €240 million per year, we must not have more of the same.If one says in a letter that Merrill Lynch is the financial adviser to the Department, one must ask by whose decision.  The decision in this regard was a disastrous, overpriced decision and we cannot have more of that.  That is why we need an oversight committee that will be at arm's length from the people who are taking some of the decisions.  It must have a degree of independence to ensure information will be available to all sides and all members.  The Oireachtas committee must have regard to what I stated about the contracting of services, the valuation of debt or, for example, the manner in which bonds are issued.  I refer to the question of whether a distinction might be drawn between bonds issued generally in respect of an entire institution or packages of bonds that carry different levels of risk.  These are points on which people have opinions.I believe Deputy Edward O'Keeffe's views are genuinely held.  He is taking the cover off the notion that there are some people who simply understand all of these matters and that the public and elected representatives do not.  He implies there are some special people who understand this subject.  They are highly priced people who will not get out of bed except for €1 million per year and they become insecure if they do not have share options.  If they want to change position, the share options must travel with them.  They also expect a retirement package.  If something goes wrong and they have to leave, they have to be sent off with a blast of gold that would frighten anybody.  This is nonsense.When considering accountability, we must ask what we are elected for.  We are elected to answer questions on the street.  Very straightforward people ask me what has happened the people who made all the bad decisions.  I refer to the Secretary General in the Department of Finance at the time in question, the Governor of the Central Bank, the regulator, all the supporting staff and those involved with all the contracts.  They have all walked away.  The Minister needs to make it clear he has made a break with the past in this regard.  It must not be a case of going back to the people whom one supposes know how to do business, as Deputy Edward O'Keeffe suggests.  If they did know how to do business, they did a very bad job of it.  People are paying the price for this, no matter how often one disagrees.  Our ability to create a flow of liquidity, such as is needed to save businesses and jobs, is connected to the price we are paying for saving a banking system that has been wrecked.  It is insulting to one's intelligence to suggest these are two separate questions.  They are analytically distinct if one wants to structure proposals but one has a consequence for the other.The Minister should be clear on whether all the people who over-priced their services and gave the bad advice will be excluded from receiving money from the trough of €240 million.  Will they simply come back again, telling in many cases the usual story that the crisis was caused by international turbulence over which we had no control?  Language has slipped away in regard to all these rationalisations of failure, stupidity, laziness, ignorance and arrogance.

I am sure that, in many cases, the ordinary, average shareholders in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks debated whether one should pay €500,000 or €1.5 million to the people in charge of those banks.  Some of the deals negotiated were obscene.  The argument in their favour was that the system involved gambling of such a sophisticated international kind that one might lose the directors to somewhere else if one did not pay them so much.

That tells us a lot.  It gives significance to where we are going.  I hope the Minister realises we are supporting his suggestion if he is talking about a change of culture.  There must be a change of culture and process, and transparency must be introduced.  There must also be an opportunity for those who are elected to be able to try to move the economy on to a safer place.  Some space must be provided where people who are concerned about the public interest will be able to come to a committee and offer oversight or opinions on policy.The Minister has already appointed a public interest director to Anglo Irish Bank and to the other banks that come under the guarantee scheme, but they sit there, trammelled in regard to the public interest because they are directors under the Companies Acts and they are limited in what they can do.  That is why we do not get a geek out of them on all of the issues that are being discussed on the street and by those who care for a sound financial system.  Some of them are so changed that they have become bankers.  They have decided, for example, that when they entered the holy circle they understood how magic was made and all the members of the public, including the elected representatives of which they were once numbered, do not understand this complicated stuff where people used to give themselves €1 million for inflating their ego.The Labour Party supports amendment No. 2, but we stress the importance of amendment No. 4, which proposes the setting up of an oversight committee because we believe it is to be perhaps the most important of all.  I am deliberately focusing on this amendment because the other one which I am particularly interested in occurs much later.  It relates to the gagging clause on the chief executive and the chairman.  Between now and when we get to that amendment the Minister should ask his officials to have a good, long, slow look at what is happening with Professor Nutt and his colleagues across the water.  One will see then the consequences of requiring someone to come to a committee and say he or she will not produce anything on his or her computer, not have a bad thought about the Government, not say anything that would upset any Minister or the Government, and that he or she is willing to be chief executive or chairman.  If the Minister gets such a person to intellectually spancel themselves like that, they would not be worth much.We are back to the issue of whose committee it is to be; the Government's or the party that forms part of the Government, and what is to be the status of the people who are attending it?  We will discuss that in detail when we come to it.  The most important thing about those two committees is that there should not be any suggestion to us that it is really a matter now of finishing off this Bill rather quickly and getting on with things the way we were.  I would repeat everything I said.  I would say every word of it publicly about all of the people I mentioned who have disgracefully damaged this country.  As I read in Senator Ross's book, there was this little network, this clique, who moved from one position to another, sometimes chief executive, tomorrow chairman and then one went back on the board.Reference was made to a definition of a niche bank.  What is a niche bank?  It operates on the basis that the potential borrower enters into a relationship with the assistant manager, he or she identifies a particular project and, as they say in the Enid Blyton books, two go gambling together.  That is what the niche bank was.  It was no more systemic than a dandelion.  What one means by being systemic is that it is so bad that it can scandalously degrade the reputation of the other parts of the banking system.  It is systemic in its toxicity and in its consequences.  That is why the Minister should accept amendments Nos. 2 and 4, and he should do so with a flourish and say he is introducing transparency and accountability into banking.

Fine Gael's amendment No. 2 sets out some of the functions that the proposed committee on NAMA could have.  That should be considered by the Minister.  I am surprised there has not been an amendment from him on Report Stage to set up a committee to oversee both NAMA and the master special purpose vehicle.The Fine Gael Party has consistently sought a reduction in the number of Oireachtas committees and for them to be restructured along the lines of the committees in America, where there is proper scrutiny, probity and accountability.  Not many committees are more important than a committee on NAMA.  A €54 billion gamble is being taken and taxpayers' money needs to be fully protected.  There needs to be proper transparency and accountability.  The public need to know that there are no sweetheart deals or underhand dealings taking place.  They need to be assured that there are proper checks and balances, especially when hard-earned taxpayers' money is at stake.The Minister does not go far enough in only providing for quarterly reporting.  I support the proposal in amendment No. 4 for monthly reporting on NAMA.  That would allow for information to be provided in a timely manner, which is what taxpayers need to see.  If the legislation needs to be amended in the future, that will only become apparent if there is proper scrutiny.  The committee needs to become proactive in that regard.  We all agree that a properly functioning committee with adequate resources is required.  The sooner the Minister accepts this view and gets on with business, the better.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I support the amendments but I am not sure I do so with a great deal of conviction.  I am not sure that it is possible to have a functioning oversight system consistent with the provision in the Bill to muzzle the chief executive of NAMA when appearing before a committee.  It does not make sense to provide for democratic oversight and at the same time say in section 57 that the chief executive or chairperson may not express an opinion about Government policy.  I find it difficult to get my head around how democratic oversight of this enterprise can be given expression if the chief executive is muzzled.  I would have thought the whole point was that one would get his or her assessment, experience and evaluation.  Without that, it is very difficult to know how such a committee would work.This is the clash of culture to which Deputy Higgins referred.  In my 20 years plus in this House, there has been a gradual and ongoing erosion of the position of Parliament vis-à-vis the Executive.  Gradually, the Executive has arrogated to itself more and more powers as the years have passed and Parliament’s standing has been diminished.  Therefore, when we provide for democratic oversight in these amendments, to which I hope the Minister will agree, unless it can be given real meaning by the testimony or advice of the chief executive, chairperson or whoever to that committee, in the sense that the person is free to express his or her evaluation and give his or her genuine assessment, that will undermine the value of it.  What has motivated the Minister to retain section 57(2)(a)?  I welcome his commitment to delete section 57(2)(b).  Is it seriously being posited that the people who will appear before the committee are sufficiently feeble-minded to be exploited to the narrow advantage of the Opposition vis-à-vis Government?  They are not that type.  That does not happen before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Without the ability to question about the entire gamut before it, the committee will be ineffectual.This is part of the reason we are here now.  If there had been a structured imposition on the Governor of the Central Bank or on the Financial Regulator to appear before an informed committee of the House, we might not be in the current mess.  The fact is that when they make their occasional visits, by courtesy rather than obligation, they will not deal frankly with the questions.  Their mindset is that they are responsible to the Minister, not the committee.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	That does not mean the Governor of the Central Bank does not make his views known to the Minister and to the Department of Finance, and I am not referring just to the quarterly reports.  It is not acceptable that the governor points to the paragraph at the bottom of page 28 of the report of 2006 and says: "There it is.  I alerted you to the credit expansion problem, the danger of the bubble and so forth".I recall when the estimable previous governor appeared before the DIRT inquiry.  He told us, quite properly at the time, that his role was not a consumer role.  A number of questions were asked about taxation, evasion issues and so forth.  I asked him what exactly he did.  He replied that he was responsible for the prudential supervision of the banks.  Unless this committee is enabled to ask the chief executive of NAMA meaningful questions and get meaningful answers, it will be a fig leaf.  That would be a great pity.The Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank must accept their huge share of responsibility for what has happened.  One can talk all one likes about government, the Minister for Finance, the policy decisions, the global financial crisis and letting Lehman Brothers fail but, ultimately, if those agencies had been doing their jobs as they ought when the credit expansion was allowed to grow unhindered in this economy, our situation would be somewhat and probably considerably better than it is.  I am not sure there is an acceptance of that.  There was no statement from the Financial Regulator, either before he left or since then, stating, "I was wrong and derelict.  My people did not have the information".  I do not believe he can say that.The Department of Finance has not explained why it got matters so badly wrong over so many years and especially why it allowed this bubble to grow in the economy without interference.  The record of the Central Bank in public documents or in the documents that are accessible to those who are not members of the Government or the Minister for Finance does not show, even on close subsequent reading, an alertness to the problems that were building.If we provide that Dáil Éireann or the Oireachtas will have an oversight role, that role must be meaningful.  Otherwise, it is not worth the candle.  If people have the mindset that they are responsible to the Minister for Finance and that their job is to obfuscate before committees of the House, it will not work.There are huge issues of national interest at stake here.  There are sensitive issues that go to the heart of the country's reputation.  There are also sensitive issues about the sheer scale of the taxpayers' investment involved, as well as sensitive issues about state aid and its implications.  That is why I have been more equivocal on the creation of the SPV than many commentators outside the House.  I do not know if it is significant that the EUROSTAT approval is no longer on the website or why that is the case.  The document ought to be laid formally before the House by the Minister.  There are a number of matters in that approval to which we will return under the relevant sections of the Bill.Amendment No. 2 proposes that it shall be the job of the committee to review the shareholders agreement.  Many commentators have said they were taken aback by this development but even those who are inclined to see the SPV merely as a technical device to avoid having this additional debt taken into account in the national accounts are puzzled as to how the Minister can assure us that NAMA will still be calling the shots.  With a construct where private equity is the majority shareholder, is it feasible and safe that NAMA, by way of shareholders agreement and a veto for NAMA, is calling the shots rather than the private interest?Consider the document that Deputy Burton opened at the beginning of today's session.  It is extremely difficult for the informed, interested and concerned public to reach conclusions about the issues before us when one sees the contents of that document, based on expert advice presented by Merrill Lynch at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  If one talked to the porter in the Shelbourne Hotel at the same stage that document was compiled, he would have given a more reliable steer on the future of Anglo Irish Bank, its soundness and whether it was systemic to the banking system.  It does not surprise me that the Minister tried to find advice wherever he might get it.  If that is the type of official advice he was getting, it is a cause for alarm.The Minister said in response to Deputy Burton that a niche bank can be systemic, as if that was the end of the debate.  This bank had nothing to do with the money transmission system, did not have a high street presence and was essentially a credit union for billionaire developers.  How he can say it was a systemic bank is beyond me.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I look forward to that.The issue here is so big that it warrants oversight by the Oireachtas, and the Minister has accepted that in principle.  However, consider the scale of the sum of €54 billion.The €54 billion that NAMA will pay out represents almost twice our annual revenue income and must be viewed in the context of all the fuss that is being made about the budget and the number of people who are tearing their hair out trying to identify €4 billion in savings.  We are dealing with an issue which the Minister states will give rise to a cost of €7 billion, whereas outside experts indicate that it will cost approximately €12 billion.  Last night, Mr. Peter Matthews pointed out that if one presumes that the 40% of performing loans can be recovered, in their entirety, to the tune of €30.8 billion and if one applies a factor of 25% recovery in respect of the 60%, or €46.2 billion, in non-performing loans, this gives rise to an additional €11.5 billion.  If one adds the latter amount to €30.8 billion, one arrives at a figure of €42.3 billion.  If this is then subtracted from €54 billion, one is left with €11.7 billion.  According to Mr. Matthews, this would represent a good return.  That is the scale of what we are discussing and that is why this matter warrants ongoing supervision on the part of the Oireachtas.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I strongly support amendment No. 2.  I have been a Member of the House for many years and during that time I have not come across legislation as important or with such financial implications as that before the House.  If one calculated the costs accrued on foot of all the legislation in respect of which I have made contributions during the past 30 years, the aggregate figure would not in any way compare to the enormous sums relating to the establishment of NAMA.  Correspondingly, the risk to the taxpayer is that much greaterI do not pretend to be an expert on matters of this sort.  I have tended not to rely on experts and that tendency has been reinforced as a result of many recent events relating to banking matters.  However, all I can foresee is the taxpayer being exposed in respect of extremely substantial sums.  I hope the most optimistic predictions will prevail and that taxpayers will not be exposed.  However, the possibility of exposure clearly exists.We live in a democracy and in such circumstances this Parliament must play a significant role in monitoring what is going to happen in respect of NAMA.  The way for Parliament to do so would be through a properly serviced Oireachtas committee.  During the 30 years I have been a Member of the Houses I have served on many committees and I have witnessed the pressures under which colleagues operate and which are exerted on those committees.  The Committee of Public Accounts has been the most effective such committee in the context of achieving a specific purpose.  To all intents and purposes, it is a role model.  I am not in any way downplaying the work of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  The latter has many other jobs to do.  There would be no point in referring the job of oversight to the Joint Committee on Finance, which is obliged to deal with the Finance Bill each year and with many other matters.  It is already fully engaged.What is needed to deal with such an enormous job of work is a separate Oireachtas committee.  I am of the view that such a committee should be modelled to a substantial degree on the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would go further and state that it is a sine qua non that it should be chaired by an Opposition Member, if only from the point of view that this would bestow upon it democratic legitimacy.  There is no suggestion that the person appointed as chairman would hassle the Minister.  That does not happen in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not know whether it is by tradition or otherwise but, as with most democracies, the Chairman of the latter has always been a Member of the Opposition.  The model employed in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts has worked and that is the point from which we should start with the committee to which amendment No. 2 refers.It is essential that such a separate committee, chaired by an Opposition Member, should have access to the best resources available.  The Committee of Public Accounts would be a disaster if it did not have available to it the support provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Much of the committee's investigative work is based on the detailed analysis produced for it by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Members of the committee are just not competent enough — in any event they do not have access to the relevant documents — to produce detailed reports such as those supplied by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is for this reason that the combination of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts provides a good democratic dividend.  I would like a similar democratic dividend to be forthcoming via the establishment of an Oireachtas oversight committee on NAMA.Deputy Bruton and others have already made arguments in respect of the various powers that should be put in place.  I am sure that such powers are not set in stone.  The Minister may be of the view that we should not go as far as creating an advise-and-consent situation similar to that which obtains in the American Senate in respect of appointments.  It is a question of degree.  However, there should be a substantive role for an Oireachtas oversight committee to play with regard to the various issues in respect of which Deputy Bruton and others have put forward arguments.The Minister is at the centre of a major debate.  He indicated that he is open to reasoned arguments.  I wish to put such an argument to him, the basis of which is that an effective Oireachtas oversight committee which would have access to the proper resources and to which as many of the powers necessary to bestow upon it the strongest possible democratic legitimacy would be granted.  Such a committee should have legitimacy in and of itself and also in the eyes of the public.  There is an entire spectrum of views in the House in respect of NAMA.  Members of the public are not convinced that it is the answer and there is great trepidation among them with regard to the approach that is being adopted.  People's concerns would be allayed, to a degree, if there were parliamentary oversight of the strongest possible sort in respect of the activities of NAMA.On Committee Stage, the Minister referred to the line that exists between the Legislature and the Executive.  I understand that such a line exists.  However, there is a way of marrying the points raised by members with those expressed by the Minister in respect of reserved Executive functions.  Now is the time for the Minister to reach out not only to the Opposition, but also to the public and provide a reassurance that a strong committee such as that to which I refer will be put in place and that it will provide effective oversight in respect of NAMA.

I wish to reiterate my personal support for the idea of an Oireachtas committee to monitor the activities of NAMA.  Given the huge amount of money involved, €54 billion — it could be more — the public will not be happy with any less a form of scrutiny.  For this reason, I suggested during our Committee Stage deliberations last week, which I was privileged to attend although I am not a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, that the proposed committee should be called a NAMA scrutiny committee.On amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Burton, I argued against this proposal on Committee Stage and do so again now.  An oversight committee means a committee that would look over the shoulder of the board and executive of NAMA.  That I believe is not the function of a proper committee.  In my view the committee should be a committee of this House which will monitor and review NAMA.The wording of the amendment appears a little contradictory.  It states that the oversight committee shall mean a committee of Dáil Éireann or a sub-committee thereof so enjoined and appointed by resolutions of that House and consisting of specified persons not being Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.To my knowledge, we have never, as an Oireachtas, appointed a committee comprising of members outside this House.  This proposal is peculiar in that regard.

For those reasons, I believe amendment No. 4 does not pass mustard, with all due respect to Deputy Burton.Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Bruton.  As I stated last week on Committee Stage there is much in this amendment I can support and believe is valuable.  The provisions I do not support or believe are worthy of support are those which seek to take away the executive functions of NAMA and from the statute of the Minister.  The functions listed at subsection (3) paragraphs (a) to (e), possibly (f), but probably not, and (g) and (h) are the type of functions which should be the preserve of the board, the chief executive and the Minister as set out in this legislation.I accept that subsection (3) paragraphs (j), (k) and (l) could be functions that would come within the remit of an Oireachtas scrutiny committee.  I want to repeat my comments of last week that this committee should be properly staffed and resourced with full legal powers of compellability of witnesses.  When dealing with a sum of €54 billion there should be no question but that where a committee subpoenas a person to appear before it such person must attend, as they say in legal parlance, ad duces tecum testificandum — they must testify and must bring their documents.  This, for me, is also the bottom line in terms of compellability.I disagree with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte with regard to amendment No. 73.  It would be preposterous if the chief executive or chairman of NAMA appeared before a committee and stated he or she believed a different policy was required.  That is not their job.  If he or she were to be elected to Dáil Éireann or to be Minister for Finance then he or she could create and submit that policy on the floor of the House for scrutiny.

It should not be an oversight committee that looks over the shoulder of NAMA or tries to jump into the executive hot seat.  That is not our system of government as set down in the Constitution.I listened with great interest to the stimulating panorama presented by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  As usual, however, it was not complete.  He spoke only about Anglo Irish Bank not being systemic.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party did not support the bank guarantee scheme——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	431	My time has come to speak.  There has been an extensive argument about the systemic character of Anglo Irish Bank.  While I am not certain that arises in the context of this amendment the debate has partaken of a Second Stage debate.I want to reiterate yet again that Anglo Irish Bank was a systemic bank at the time of the bank guarantee scheme and its nationalisation because it was a bank with a balance sheet in excess of €100 billion, more than two-thirds of our GDP.  It was a bank whose deposit base consisted of in excess of €50 billion worth of deposits as of September 2008.  The total number of depositors throughout the world was in excess of 250,000, of whom more than 150,000 were in the United Kingdom.  That is a very large number of depositors and a very large amount of money.  The idea that the collapse of such an institution by a Government would have no implications for the rest of the banking sector or for the financing of the State, guarantee or no guarantee, is utterly fallacious.One could argue, as Deputy Burton argued on Committee Stage, that the Government could have opted — it considered this — to nationalise the bank on 30 September and guarantee the other institutions.  The only effect of that would have been an immediate requirement on the taxpayer to put substantial funding into that bank immediately.  In any event, that funding had to be provided some time later.  That is the only material difference I can see.

That was something we had to take into account also.  I am only dealing with that issue as an aside.The core issue this afternoon is the question of the committee and what powers it should have.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Would the Minister tell us why his officials were writing to Europe saying Anglo was fine?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Government is there to make decisions.  Deputies Terence Flanagan and Higgins asked why the committee was not part of the legislation.  We dealt with this issue at length on Committee Stage.  Most sides of the House would accept that there is an excessive number of committees.  Entrenching the existence of a committee in legislation is not a desirable way to go at a time when we are talking about reforming the numbers of committees.  In addition, there is clearly not all-party agreement on the character of this committee.  Some argue for a full committee, while others argue for a sub-committee of the existing Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.

I do not accept there is any reason to depart from this practice in this case.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that Oireachtas scrutiny is desirable.  However, Oireachtas oversight would interfere not so much with the Minister, but with the board it is proposed to appoint to manage NAMA.  So many powers have been conferred on this committee in the main Opposition party amendment that the committee would itself constitute a board of the National Asset Management Agency.I indicated on Committee Stage that I will consult the Opposition leaders on appointments to NAMA and that I will disclose the names I am considering for the board.  Following on last week's debate, an advertisement was placed in the daily national newspapers earlier this week seeking expressions of interest in appointment to the board.

It is essential that it does that, because I would not be able to do all the work on this matter alone.  I am inviting expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons for appointment to the board of NAMA.  I hope it is not suggested the Department will conceal some of these individuals from me.  I believe this is the appropriate approach.What would an Oireachtas committee do?  It would not be appropriate for the Oireachtas to appoint a second committee of experts to second-guess the decisions of the board.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	453	It is a matter for all of us to agree as to whether it should be a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service or a full committee of the House.  I have an open mind on that and I am open to persuasion.  What I agree to in principle is that a committee or a sub-committee should be established to scrutinise NAMA.  I propose to contact the Chief Whip in the coming days to prepare an Oireachtas resolution to provide for the establishment of the committee or sub-committee and the specific detail on the terms of reference.  Opposition parties will be consulted in the usual way as part of this process and any such resolution must be presented to the House for approval.  That is the way we set up a parliamentary committee.I have also accepted the amendments that the reports should be issued quarterly.  We considered the vast information in that regard and the committee will have plenty of material to work on from a quarterly report.  We also discussed on Committee Stage when the first quarterly report would arise, which will be in late March 2010.  In addition, Deputy Burton expressed the specific concern that an amount of the work in terms of the issue of the bonds will take place before 31 March next.  Initially, I explored with her the concept of a process order, but I never indicated that the process order would be entrenched in legislation.  However, when I raised the possibility of the process order, I found she was unconvinced of the merits of this approach.I then pointed out on Committee Stage that the regulator would have a specific role with regard to the validation of the issue of the securities in the context of our obligations to the European Union.  I felt the regulator would be an appropriate person to report to the Oireachtas on that matter also, so that there would be greater scrutiny by any committee we established of the issue of the relevant bonds.  I indicated I was open to that and do not have difficulty with such scrutiny.I am not sure where——

It is an external appointment and will create confidence in our regulatory system.  The least the regulator is entitled to is a fair trial by the Deputy, rather than to be condemned in advance that he will presumptively not co-operate with the institutions of Parliament.

I said I do not see how it would be necessary for it to be in private.  I am open and will ask the Chief Whip to prepare the necessary resolution.  The terms of reference can be discussed between the Whips.  I have also included a provision at a later stage for appointment to the audit committee of a Member of the Oireachtas, if the Opposition parties are so minded.  I know some Members have reservations about this and I understand that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I have just a couple of questions for my two-minute slot.  Why has the Minister reversed his view that he thought it appropriate that the Oireachtas would have a role in respect of the valuation committee?  That was an explicit statement he made but he is now providing no statutory arrangement.  Why does he believe the Oireachtas should have no role in the board subsequent to the first board he is appointing?I have heard the Minister when in Opposition repeatedly claim that the Oireachtas had ceded too much authority and that it should have enhanced powers over agencies.  As soon as he becomes Minister, however, he comes into this House and says the very opposite, that the Dáil should be bounced back into the old way, the way things were always done so everything is kept under wraps and the Oireachtas can see nothing and anything it can see, it does not have the expertise to analyse.  The Minister wants things to go back to the old way.  He is not even offering half a loaf, he is offering a single slice when providing for this committee.  The one backbench Deputy who has spoken endorsed the idea and wanted to see legislative provision for the existence of the committee so that a future Minister for Finance or Government could not eliminate a NAMA committee for scrutiny.Many of these powers are appropriate.  Why should the Oireachtas not have a power over guarantees that the Minister issues on the taxpayers' behalf to the tune of thousands of millions of euro?  It is a fundamental right of the Dáil to sanction spending.  Why not have a right to approve guarantees?  Guarantees are commitments that we, the taxpayer, will honour if things go wrong and we are entitled to a role in that.  What we have set out is not unreasonable and I am very disappointed.  The Minister should immediately circulate the terms of reference he envisages so that we do not find in a week's time, when all this is over, that the Minister's idea of a committee with some slight powers, that is a slice of bread, has turned into the few crumbs we see in the legislation today.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The Minister is playing with the House.  He appears to offer a crumb here and there but, in effect, as the bankers would put it, it is business as usual.If we are sceptical about the regulator appearing before an Oireachtas committee and opening his heart to it and telling it as it is, it is because we have bitter experience.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	471	If there was no crash, Irish Nationwide is experiencing a little local difficulty, such as needing €8 billion of distressed loans to be written off.  If that is not a crash, I do not know what is.  I worked in banking and €8 billion in a small building society constitutes a crash.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	473	If one went back to the spring and summer of 2007, was the Government doing its job?  If the Minister for Finance was doing his job and if the Department of Finance had been awake and was paying attention to what was happening in the banking system, there would have been action that would have diminished the level of the crisis in Ireland by a considerable margin.  If the Minister feels that we are sceptical about the regulator, it is because we have the experience of those fine gentlemen coming in and telling us repeatedly, as in the Minister's draft report to Brussels, that the fundamentals were sound and that every Irish bank was wonderful.There is so much liability being transferred to the Irish taxpayer, €54 billion, that to go along with the old ways without transparency is a huge mistake on the part of the Minister.  He has put himself forward on previous occasions as being somewhat enlightened in terms of opening up Government to transparency and oversight but he is anything but that in this case.  I regret the approach he is taking because Irish taxpayers will pay for it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The passage of this Bill through the House is bordering on a shambles.  The Minister is making off with €54 billion of taxpayers' money to give it to the corrupt bankers and we are getting not even a commitment but a vague comment of some oversight.  We are not even getting a firm committee.  That should be dealt with now.  We do not know what the Minister is bringing in but it should be before us to examine line by line and nothing else is acceptable.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Why does the Minister think the Committee of Public Accounts has a statutory basis?  If it has a statutory basis, why can a committee as important as this, overseeing the expenditure of €54 billion not have a statutory basis?This is typical Department of Finance stuff.  During all the years I have been in here, the Department of Finance has wanted to hold power in its hands at all times.  If we had provision in legislation, the crisis we are facing now would not have happened because it would have been debated here on a regular basis and the Minister would have been answering questions.  That would have been to his advantage.What guarantee can the Minister give the Irish taxpayer that after the next election, whoever is in the Minister's chair will reappoint the committee?  If it does not have a statutory basis, there is no guarantee that the committee will continue into the next Dáil or the following Dáil.There is no explanation.  If the Committee of Public Accounts has a statutory footing, surely expenditure of this size should fall within an oversight committee's remit.  Who will represent the taxpayer on the board?  Surely the taxpayer is entitled to know who will represent him.  It is a reasonable request.What about the master special purpose vehicle?  We do not even know about it.  Why should we not have power to review the shareholders' agreement undertaken by the master special purpose vehicle?  This is a joke, where no power is being given to the Oireachtas to perform its function and check what is happening.In all my time in this House and in Government, it was the same old story, and the Minister knows it.  The Department of Finance will demand to see all legislation that goes to the Cabinet before anything can be done.  That is exactly what is happening here, they are all afraid to release power to the Oireachtas because they know best.

Whether we like it or not, there will be a conspiracy that it is a bailout for the bankers, where we sort out our friends with a nudge and a wink.  There could be issues of public confidence, disclosure and non-disclosure that are very sensitive.  In that context, having scrutiny by a committee on an ongoing basis might not be a good idea.

The Houses of the Oireachtas are trying to reduce the number of committees.  How can that be squared with adding another committee and more costs?  I understand the Committee of Public Accounts has powers of compellability and that any regulator could be compelled to come before the committee, even if a new committee was not established.  I presume the usual restrictions would apply to anyone coming before the committee.  The person cannot give his or her opinion on an issue but may only state fact and is prohibited from disclosing sensitive information.  This would be well and good.  It is not necessary to disclose material to the public view that could damage the country.  While non-disclosure and lax regulation caused much of this problem we need to ensure that we do not go too far in the other direction.  Minutiae cannot be disclosed line by line every second week at a committee.  That is why I agree with the Minister about checks and balances.  Is that part of the Minister's reasoning, that he does not want sensitive information that could be damaging to the interest of the country being disclosed?

We might have had a different outcome.  The outcome now is a huge bill of over €50 billion, huge exposure of the taxpayer and the Minister tells us that he agrees with the principle of parliamentary oversight——

We will not fall out over semantics.He talks about setting up a sub-committee of one of the existing committees of the Houses.  Does the Minister realise what he is doing?  There is a model that has worked well since the foundation of the State.  It is embedded in statute and it is the model we should be following.  Setting up a sub-committee is the last thing the Minister should do.  It has no statutory basis, could be chaired by anybody, has no assured existence and might not last beyond the next election which could be in a month's time.  That is no assurance to the House or the people.I will not make a personal remark but I have an awful feeling that the Minister has become a prisoner of the Department.

It has fine officials, great backroom training and expertise but they are officials.  They have an official mind.  They are different from politicians who have a different approach and, with all due respects, are closer to the people.  The mix of the two can contribute something.  The notion that the officials have advised the Minister against setting up an independent scrutiny committee of the Oireachtas is par for the course.  They would not see the need for it but the Minister should see the need for it.  This House sees the need for it.  The Minister's colleague, speaking a while ago, indicated that he saw the need for it.  We are talking about enormous moneys, and a reasonable request from this Parliament.  We want scrutiny over this €50 billion and the way to achieve that is to set up a scrutiny committee along the lines proposed.  I urge the Minister as strongly as I can to take this on board and do it in the interest of democracy and of proper scrutiny of this enormous sum.

The public is watching this debate and sees that it is being sold a three-card trick as the Minister talks about setting up an Oireachtas sub-committee with little if any power, when he could do the decent thing, accept our amendment, put the committee on a statutory footing and allow for proper transparency at valuation stage which is key.  Regardless of the oversight post-evaluation it is critical to get the evaluations right.  I would like to see the Minister take on board this reasonable amendment and put this committee on a statutory footing.  I do not know what he has to fear.  He clearly does not want to set up the committee but to create a fudge.  I welcome the fact that the Green Party is taking part in the debate because Deputy Gogarty's was the first contribution——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	513	When Deputy Gogarty expresses his no doubt genuine concern about the cost of a committee I reckon that under the new pared down regime implemented by the Minister for Finance a committee probably costs up to €20,000 a year these days.  It would be €20,000 well spent.  That is not a compelling argument against invigilating an investment of €54 billion by the taxpayer.  A more serious argument is whether it should be an integral part of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, expanded or otherwise, or a sub-committee of that committee.  Its powers must be clear if it is to be meaningful.When one reads the Minister's amendments on more complex issues it is clear that this has not defeated the Minister's capacity to design a committee.  The Minister would do that in a spurt on a Sunday morning radio show, off the top of his head without any bother.  Why he has not brought this amendment before us when he has brought more complex ones before us must lead us to doubt whether there is any change in the mindset.  If this House had been in possession of some of the sensitive information we might not be in the situation we are in.  The mindset that says that the repository of all wisdom is on the Government side and in the Department of Finance and the other agencies has, I am afraid, been changed utterly and forever.  The Minister is not acknowledging that in playing us along and saying he will get out of this House and into the next House which may or may not pay much attention or be up to speed on where he is.  He thinks he will have no difficulty with the Seanad and that he will be clean away.

I believe we will.  It is important that we establish one.  I do not believe it is desirable to entrench it in legislation.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the example of the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it hears the audits of accounts for a whole range of Departments.  In this case, it is only a single statutory authority.

Again, we will have to decide whether it will be a committee or a sub-committee.

That is not at all the case.  Most committees and boards established by statute only have an annual reporting function which all Members know can be very uninformative.  In this case, the statutory authority will give quarterly reports and an Oireachtas committee will be dedicated exclusively to the scrutiny of the authority.  I do not dispute that it is desirable that should be the case but I am making the point that in corporate governance terms a quarterly report is a far more ample accounting mechanism than annual reports with their impressive covers and somewhat less impressive information between them.

Due to the concern expressed by Deputy Joan Burton on the issue of the bonds, I drew to her attention the European arrangement.  I have the undertaking of the regulator to work with such a committee as well.  It is not the regulator but a person designated by the regulator as he could not take a personal interest in the vast wealth of information involved.  These matters have been attended to.Deputy Bernard Durkan raised the matter about parliamentary questions concerning the body.  They will be dealt with in a manner similar to that in which my Department deals with queries concerning the Revenue Commissioners so that Deputies will get information in a timely way from the agency.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I must express my huge disappointment with the Minister's response.  If we have learned anything from banking crises in other countries and analyses of them from the IMF and others, the one common thread is that there must broad political consensus around a proposed solution with proper transparency and scrutiny of the asset recovery process.  As we have seen from the IMF, in cases where there is not proper scrutiny, politically motivated intentions take over in asset recovery vehicles.  When controlled by bureaucracies, these vehicles fail to fulfil for the taxpayer the recovery of assets needed.We have the opportunity to provide proper transparency.  Instead we have a Bill proposing the establishment of a body that has no obligations under the Freedom of Information Act.  It will have no register of the loans that can be viewed by the public.  There is to be no comment by NAMA executives on policy when they attend an Oireachtas committee meeting.  There will be no information as to how much the chief executive officer will be paid, no watchdog and no sight of a business plan which would show the credible foundation for undertaking this decision on public moneys.Instead there will be business plans in the future in which the Minister can, at his own whim, declare a matter confidential so that it is concealed from the Oireachtas.  This is not transparency.  If the Minister has been so sucked into the maw of the Department of Finance that he believes this is transparency to the Oireachtas, he better have a period on the backbenches to rediscover what it is to hold the Government and its agencies accountable as is our statutory duty and the purpose for which we were elected.

On his very first test on this issue, he offers a toothless committee without a legislative basis or any expertise to underpin its work.  It is the old mushroom treatment — keep them knee deep in manure and leave them in the dark.  This is what he is offering the Oireachtas in the way it will oversee the NAMA exercise.If Fine Gael makes up a government after the next election, it will establish a NAMA Oireachtas scrutiny committee on a statutory basis so that it can have proper powers and recognise the right of Members to oversee decisions.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	535	It is sufficiently important that this body has all-party consensus.  The former Swedish Minister for Finance told an all-party committee of the House that such a consensus is vital.  It is essential to have all-party understanding, willingness to confront the problem, proper scrutiny and not to pay over the price.The Minister is letting himself and his officials down in the longer term.  He entered this debate with the sort of weasel words that I would expect from Ministers who do not have the same breadth of understanding and experience he has.He also stated the proper conduit for reporting to the Oireachtas should be himself, the Minister for Fiance.  It is outrageous he thinks he can cramp the Oireachtas back on to the narrow ground which he and previous Governments have sought.The one lesson from this crisis is that we need a stronger Oireachtas that is willing to hold Ministers to account and force them to take responsibility.  It is important that those in charge of €54 billion know there will be people looking over their shoulders, others with real power to hold them accountable.Members on the opposite side, with the exception of Deputy Gogarty, have been at one on this.  I cannot understand why the Minister is resisting that consensus which has been built.  We cannot go back to this blindman's bluff as the way in which the Oireachtas holds the agencies like this to account, stumbling around in the dark in the hope we might crash up against something that exposed a weakness in the way business was being conducted.  We need instead a strong committee to hold the body to account.There are vital issues at this point such as the codes of conduct for credit, the way in which NAMA can enforce change and the way in which property is dealt with so that there are no sweetheart deals.  These are matters which require tough oversight.  The Minister has let the Oireachtas down in not being willing to give a clearer commitment that we will have a committee with a statutory base and expertise to back it up.  It must also have powers including those for appointment of boards and subsequent boards.  There is no reason the Oireachtas should be excluded from a role in the appointment of boards.  I believe that is true in the case of trivial boards and——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 16, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"2.—Where NAMA proposes to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle to purchase, manage or dispose of assets, it shall do so only in accord with regulations published by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas which shall include, but are not limited to:(a) the suitability of investors,(b) the suitability and behaviours of members of the Board,(c) the finance, planning accountability and reporting,(d) the manner in which the Special Purpose Vehicle shall discharge its functions under this Act,(e) the method of determining the appropriateness of paying a dividend or bonus to investors, and(f) its consistency with the statutory objectives of NAMA under this Act.”.This amendment seeks to put a legislative framework around the special purpose vehicle, SPV, that has arrived into this legislation without a great deal of advance notice.  The special purpose vehicle is to be a company controlled by private interests which is to have a 51% interest in it.  The investors in it are unknown at this stage.  It will have all of the powers of acquiring, managing and disposing of the assets so it will be absolutely at the heart of the activity of NAMA.  The concern of the House during Committee Stage was that while we are going to huge lengths to regulate the operation of NAMA and to set out the standards to which it should work and the reporting it should meet, we suddenly find that the action where big decisions will be made has moved offshore, so to speak.  It will now not be in NAMA, which we have regulated to a great extent in this legislation, but the final decision will rest in this other body, the special purpose vehicle.There was broad consensus on the Opposition side that this was an unsatisfactory and unacceptable way to proceed.  The Minister on Committee Stage undertook that he would consult with the Attorney General and would come back with a decision of the Attorney General in regard to how he would regulate it.  He has an amendment which offers some crumbs in regard to how it might be overseen.  It is critical that we recognise the master special purpose vehicle in the legislation, define its role and consider what sort of investors would be suitable to take up this.  Could it be the very same banks from which we are acquiring these assets that would have the final control over their purchase, management and disposal?  That would seem unthinkable, yet there is nothing in the legislation to disbar it.Equally, we need to understand the individuals who appear on this SPV board and who will be in a position of very great authority and influence.  Again, we need to know if they are suitable persons to occupy this position and whether they have any interests other than the interests they put up in terms of the €51 million that is required of them, and whether they have any other interests that might constitute a conflict in carrying out the role of managing these assets or of deciding on their purchase, disposal and management.  It is important that we would define who are appropriate people, how they should behave and what criteria they must meet in order to be acceptable as people who would play such a pivotal role in regard to an investment made by the State.The Minister has also assured us that the SPV will at all times act only to discharge the functions and purposes of this Act.  This seems to conflict with the Minister's note which he circulated last week which was to the effect that this body must have ultimate control and discretion in its activity and that the only purpose will be the public purpose, whereas it is to be a private vehicle, controlled privately with private investment moneys.  There seems to be an underlying contradiction and the only way to reconcile that contradiction would be to set out in statute exactly how we are going to regulate the potential conflict between private investors seeking their own interest, or those private investors seeking to further other interests not directly represented on the board but which might be totally inimical to the purposes of this legislation.Equally, we need to know and see that the finances, accounting and reporting of this body are in the public domain.  It is vital that there is regulation and oversight of that, including the right of the Comptroller and Auditor General to be able to audit those books appropriately, to give assurance to the taxpayer that everything is being done in a way that would be proper.A crucial issue is how dividends are to be paid.  We understand from the Minister that a crucial condition is that the SPV will get a dividend only in years in which NAMA proves to be profitable.  We need to have that spelled out.  How does one define NAMA as proving to be profitable?  Will there be a separate valuation every year of the assets that NAMA owns to find whether there is a profit being generated that year, and only if that revaluation of the assets achieves a certain result will the private investors get access to their dividend?  We need to see the detail of that.  We have only this flimsy note and the matter is not set out in detail.  With regard to the assurances we have received that this private sector body can only get something akin to returns on a Government bond, again, this needs to be set out.The Minister will probably assure us that the shareholder agreement will cover all of this.  However, just minutes ago the Minister refused to provide the Oireachtas with an opportunity to oversee the shareholder agreement.  It is vital that the shareholder agreement would be in the public domain and open to scrutiny by the Oireachtas — an Oireachtas properly empowered to scrutinise and understand the implications of these shareholder agreements.The Minister presented this body as perfectly innocuous.  There is generally a willingness to accept the Minister's assurance that this is being set up solely for a purpose of getting a certain treatment in the accounts.  However, if it is that innocuous, the Minister should have no concerns about providing the legislative oversight that would be necessary to assure the Dáil.  We also need assurances, when the Minister is gone and when NAMA perhaps seeks to alter the shareholder agreement at some subsequent opportunity, that this would be a public event and that there cannot be modifications in the shareholder agreement that have implications for the taxpayer and the public interest that are not subject to proper scrutiny and oversight.The Minister was fulsome in offering assurances to the House on the last occasion that there was nothing suspect or underhand about this SPV and that it was purely fulfilling a model that was required by EUROSTAT and had been done elsewhere without damage.  He needs to back up that with legislative provisions that would reassure the House that this is what will happen.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The Labour Party will support the Fine Gael amendment.  We have an amendment No. 17 relating to the special purpose vehicle which we consider to be very important because it cuts to its fundamental status.  This very peculiar SPV was informed to the Dáil very late in the day.  I do not believe it was the subject of any message from the Government to the Green Party that it would have such a fundamental role and would, in fact, control the issuing of the debt and control the loans to be taken over.  This is the terminology the Minister used in describing the SPV in the note he sent to the Dáil.  Despite that, and despite NAMA taking the risk, nonetheless, this SPV would have to pony up only €100 million, with €51 million to be provided by the private sector, for control of an entity which is going to control the issuance of €54 billion of Government debt.  To people involved in high finance, that is a very small amount of money.The Minister referred to the example of France as a model for the SPV.  As I pointed out to him in an earlier discussion, the banks in France were the beneficiaries of the particular French arrangements that gave rise to their SPV.  The French provided a group of investors with the funds to invest in the French SPV and, therefore, they were the representatives of the banks in the same way, say, that the Anglo ten — the ten investors who took on the shares in Anglo Irish Bank from the Quinn family — were specially related to Anglo and were significant customers of the bank.  In other words, it was a golden circle arrangement.These financial gymnastics — the use of off-balance sheet vehicles — were thoroughly discredited in the accountancy world as a result of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom.  We can say that something is off-balance sheet, and it sounds as though we are at some distance from whatever the off-balance sheet does.  In fact, the directors of Enron and WorldCom ended up being fully responsible in law for the liabilities created for the SPV.  In the same way, the Irish taxpayer remains fully responsible for the liabilities created by the SPV and by NAMA.  When discussing the crisis in banking besetting many European countries with his fellow finance Ministers, the honest thing to do would be to classify the special government measures from different EU states that obtain EU approval and which are recognised as arising as a consequence of the financial and banking crisis.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	569	In terms of the long-term governance of the European Union, I do not think this is the correct way to go.  Everybody recognises that the banking debts are special and specific, and we hope that they are one-off and pretty much limited to what is described in the Bill.  I am sure that is what the Minister wants and that is what everybody else would like to see.  However, EUROSTAT should not permit this fiction.  It is either a fiction or a kind of a fraud.  The description of the SPV states that it will be a separate legal entity entitled to its own goods and assets in its own right, have autonomy of decision in its day-to-day operations, be able to incur liabilities on its own behalf and have complete accounting information.  The Minister then listed 13 things that the SPV could do.If the SPV has these powers and is independent, then the Minister made an entirely contradictory statement when he said: "Since the State is guaranteeing the securities issued by the master SPV, the NAMA representatives on the board will maintain a veto over all decisions of the board that could affect the interests of NAMA or of the Irish Government."  When he replied to me on the issue the other day, he said: "We are not discussing a special purpose vehicle in a banking context or in the context of NAMA's balance sheet.  We are discussing a special purpose vehicle, the purpose of which is to put the entire operation outside our national accounts in the Eurostat statistics."  The Minister is trying to persuade us that he has managed to come up with a proposal that tells EUROSTAT that the SPV that does the heavy lifting will have decision making autonomy in respect of its principal functions.  The SPV will have majority private sector ownership at 51%.  NAMA in the public sector will be able to maintain a veto over all decisions of the SPV in the private sector that could affect the interests of NAMA or of the Government, but the SPV will still be able to have considered decision making autonomy.  This is obviously contradictory, and it is where the fiction lies in the fictional statement by EUROSTAT.The Bill has no provision anywhere for a NAMA group entity that has private sector majority ownership.  It is simply not in the Bill.  I understand where the Minister's desire to take part in this exercise arises from, but it is an extremely unwise exercise and if it is the preferred method to be adopted by the European Commission, EUROSTAT and the ECB, then it is very foolish.The issuing of the bonds is currently based on an interest rate of 1%.  Interest rates are likely to rise slowly but surely as European economies recover.  We hope it will not be much more than a 2% interest rate rise over a period of time.  The SPV will make it much more difficult to manage things when it is loss making.  It is almost bound to be loss making because of the structure the Minister has put on it once the rates of interest rise.  The Minister will say that this is only for a period of time and that we are looking at the long-term ten year life cycle of the SPV.  If it is autonomous and loss making, its funding costs will be far higher because it will be going to the bond markets and the formal, legal agency will be issuing the NAMA bonds.  Is the Minister saying it is not the formal agency that is issuing the NAMA bonds?

I am not sure that this has been thought through.  The Government will probably need regular EU approval for State aid.  We saw a memo today to the EU that dealt with Anglo Irish Bank on the eve of the bank's nationalisation and which claimed that everything was fine.  I think there are severe problems with this entity and I would like to hear from the Minister how he gets over the essential contradictions at the heart of this particular creation.Most people I meet on the street and at club functions and so on are actually worried to death about NAMA.  They are worried about the implications for themselves and their families of the cost of the €54 billion that is riding on NAMA and for which they are responsible.  Almost everybody I have met sees the SPV as some kind of clever accounting trick of the loop that was introduced at the last minute.  They feel they will be even more exposed, as if they had been dealing with a fairground trickster.  The debate on NAMA has lasted more than six months since the initial comments on the draft legislation before the summer.  Until the week before last, at no point during the long debate had the Minister or any of his Government colleagues said that a vehicle of this nature would be a critical part of the entire NAMA architecture.  That is why the sections of the Fine Gael proposal that set out minimum regulations with regard to the SPV are to be welcomed.  While we will support those sections, we feel that our amendment addresses a more fundamental issue that arises in respect of this vehicle.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The introduction of the SPV question changed the whole debate on NAMA overnight.  It brought into focus the fact that SPVs are private vehicles, in effect.  It just so happens that the State will have a veto on the decisions taken by this SPV.  The Minister's amendment No. 44 proposes the insertion of a new section that will make certain provisions for NAMA group entities.  It appears that the only involvement the Minister will have in these entities will be in appointing their directors and disclosing their interests.  What about the issue of reporting requirements?  What about the lines of control?  Will the SPV and NAMA have a common CEO?  In terms of our dealings with the EU, will the SPV or NAMA be the formal reporting entity?  As Deputy Burton has said, the SPV is being granted the authority to deal with all aspects of NAMA, in effect.  It will be responsible for the purchase, management and disposal of loan assets identified and valued by NAMA.  Major questions arise about the legal basis for that.  A number of years from now, NAMA's veto over the board of the SPV could be legally challenged by private shareholders and its validity might not stand up.It is understandable that taxpayers have major concerns about the proposal to give a private vehicle responsibility, in effect, for managing €54 billion of debt that is being borrowed on their behalf.  I do not doubt that the Minister will have noted that a rating agency, the Fitch Group, today downgraded Ireland's credit rating from AA+ to AA-.  The agency stated that it does not regard the off-balance sheet mechanism — the SPV — as an effective way of parking the €54 billion of debt I have mentioned.  It said that it downgraded its rating of Irish Government debt partly because such debt will rise to 110% of GDP by the end of 2010.This amendment raises the same question as the previous amendment, which related to the establishment of an Oireachtas oversight committee.  It is a question of transparency and accountability.  The Minister for Finance needs to take charge of the public purse and meet his commitment to look after the money of the Irish taxpayer.  He should introduce legal provisions to ensure that the SPV is subject to proper reporting requirements.I would like to raise a number of questions that the Minister did not properly clarify last week.  He said that the master SPV may create a number of subsidiary SPVs, each of which will be responsible for the loan book of an individual financial institution.  He emphasised that any such subsidiary SPV will be 100% owned by the master SPV.  I would like the Minister to confirm whether subsidiary SPVs will be established to deal with the separate loan books of the individual institutions.  Who will be on the board of these baby SPVs?  I suppose the master SPV could be referred to as the Daddy SPV.

This is extremely important.  We still do not know who the shareholders will be.  It is technically possible that the shareholders will be the banks to which we are giving €54 billion, in effect.  The Minister should make no mistake about the fact that we are bailing out the banks by giving them major breathing time.  We are taking toxic loans off the balance sheets of the same banks that are putting pressure on householders who are under severe pressure with their mortgages.  The protocol or code of conduct that is in place will assist home owners until February, but they are accountable to the banks nonetheless.  The Minister needs to provide guarantees in this area.  I cannot see how that can be done if it is not enshrined in legislation.I suggest that amendment No. 4, which is straightforward, will protect the Minister and the taxpayer when the SPV is being established.  Amendment No. 3 proposes that regulations be drawn up to cover "the suitability of investors", thereby ensuring that we do not give taxpayers' money to the same banks.  The amendment refers to "the suitability and behaviors of members of the Board" because we do not know who the members of the board will be.  What input will the Minister have into the private investors' process of appointing people to the board?Reference is made in the amendment to "the finance, planning accountability and reporting" of the SPV because such matters are critical.  I welcome the Minister's amendment, which will provide for quarterly reports.  I would like to know whether those reports will be audited.  Will the term "draft" be applied to the reports?  It is extremely important that the information we receive should be valuable.  I do not doubt that one of the reasons the business plan is a draft plan is that no auditor would sign off on it.  One could not sign off on those draft plans.  It is critical that the information we are getting stands up to proper scrutiny.Amendment No. 3 also proposes the drawing up of regulations dealing with "the manner in which the Special Purpose Vehicle shall discharge its functions under this Act".  There is no mention of how exactly the SPV will discharge its responsibility to achieve value for money on behalf of taxpayers.  The amendment also refers to "the method of determining the appropriateness of paying a dividend or bonus to investors".  Although one of the Minister's documents stated that "the profits earned by the SPV will be distributed to the shareholders according to the following arrangement", we have no idea exactly how they will be calculated.  The document also stated that the private equity investors, like NAMA, will be entitled to "receive an annual dividend linked to the performance [and profitability] of the Master SPV" and taking account of all direct and indirect costs.  How does one define performance and profitability?  These are critical issues as we try to protect the interests of the taxpayer.  The document also states that "on winding up the Master SPV, the equity investors will only be repaid their capital if the Master SPV has the resources; they will receive a further equity bonus of 10% of the capital [up to a maximum of €5 billion] if the Master SPV makes a profit".  These liquid investments will be tied up for up to ten years, but we still do not know the duration of NAMA.  We know from the business plan that the Minister has indicated that it will last for ten years, but we still do not have any idea of the length of all the loans going into NAMA.  It is clear that all the loans will be dealt with under NAMA within a ten-year period.  That presupposes the Minister will securitise the debt in NAMA at some level.  Will the SPV be doing this?The Minister stated all citizens are equal and I agree with him.  If all citizens are equal, they should have the same entitlements as the private investor.  The private investors will have proper reporting requirements.  The taxpayer is entitled to have his interests in respect of how the SPV will work protected legislatively by the Minister.  The SPV will effectively be carrying out the daily operations of NAMA.The Minister will have a veto over decisions made by the board.  Day-to-day operations will be dealt with by the CEO of the SPV but we still do not know who this will be.  It is not mentioned anywhere in the legislation.  The Minister should correct me if I am incorrect in stating there is no reference to the CEO of a group entity.  I see only a reference to the "Chief Executive Officer of NAMA".  Will the Minister clarify this?Effectively the SPV has changed the whole face of NAMA.  There is a strong case for renaming the Bill the "National Asset Management Agency and Special Purpose Vehicle Bill 2009".

Will the SPV be dealing with all the daily activities of NAMA?  Will it be purchasing and administering the assets?  Will it be paying the banks their yearly coupon and will it be disposing of assets?  Will it be collecting the repayments of debt through the banks?  Will it be dealing with the banks on a day-to-day basis?  Ultimately, the SPV is now NAMA.  NAMA has been reincarnated as the SPV, yet this is not mentioned anywhere in the legislation.The only amendments the Minister has made concern corruption and the disclosure of interests in terms of group entities.  He has not focused on the financial reporting side, particularly in terms of the group CEO.  As Deputy Barrett has enunciated at length, the Minister will have to provide a legislative basis for the SPV to ensure there will be no question of private investors taking a case alleging the Minister for Finance, be it Deputy Brian Lenihan or, as will no doubt be the case, Deputy Richard Bruton, does not have the power to enforce effectively the rights of the taxpayer in respect of the running of the SPV.  If Deputy Brian Lenihan were to consider this as a barrister rather than as Minister for Finance, I have no doubt he would advise the Government to include the SPV in the legislation.

Why did the Minister handle the matter in this way?  He never explained to the House why the SPV emerged in the public domain in the fashion that it did.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	585	When the CSO made its submission to EUROSTAT, which I believe was last July, and when the initial draft legislation was being published, was there any reason no attention was drawn to this?  The first I learned of it was when I read Matt Cooper's book approximately three weeks ago.  He refers to the SPV in the book, but in the belief that NAMA is to own it.  It emerged in the documentation the Minister's handed out last week that NAMA will not own it and that the agency is to be a minority stakeholder.Will the Minister explain why the detail emerged in the fashion it did?  It has only given rise to suspicion.  If there is a considerable row and everyone is agonising over how to decrease expenditure by €4 billion this year, I can understand why the Minister would not want to exacerbate the problem by adding the NAMA-related liability to the national debt.  However, the manner in which the detail has seeped out has not helped.  I understand the Fine Gael amendment is seeking to put some kind of statutory scaffolding around the provision.It is interesting to look at the EUROSTAT approval.  I commented earlier that it has disappeared from the website for some reason.  I presume there is no reference to it——

It refers to the Minister's submission that real estate prices in Ireland will increase by 10% over the next ten years.  It states: "EUROSTAT is not in a position to judge whether this condition in plausible, however the presence of market investors is reassuring (those providing 51% of the equity of the SPV)".  There is something endearingly naïve about that.  That it is reassured by 51% of €100 million given the scale of what we are talking about seems very puzzling.  When I asked if this could mean Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland could be subscribers for the private equity, the Minister answered bluntly this was not the case.  I trust that is on the record.  He stated the subscribers were more likely to include pension funds, for example.Deputy Richard Bruton asked whether there would be a dividend paid in a year with no profits.  Why would somebody want to invest in this vehicle?  The only reason one would want to invest is for information given that the vehicle is to acquire and manage the loans in the largest property company in the world.  It would be worthwhile putting up the money required to obtain the information that will be forthcoming.  We need to test that a little further.The EUROSTAT approval states: "The current market value is 15% lower than the LTEV [long-term economic value] but Irish authorities believe that under the current conditions the market values for properties are artificially low".  I have difficulty with that assessment.  The market value for property is the market value for property.  Perhaps the Minister will turn out to be right.  I hope he is.  I hope the increase is more than 10%.  It is interesting that EUROSTAT signs off the preliminary approval by saying:This preliminary view of EUROSTAT is based on the information provided by the country authorities.  If this information turns out to be incomplete, or the implementation of the operation differs in some way from the information presented, EUROSTAT reserves the right to reconsider its view.It is a major development.  I am not sure whether the Minister said he did not tell us about it because he was waiting for the EUROSTAT approval or that it had just come out a day or two before he made it available to us.  I do not find that entirely reassuring in the sense that if it was always contemplated and this term "NAMA group entities" was meant to encompass a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or in this case the daddy of all special purpose vehicles, in fact the mother and father of special purpose vehicles, I would have thought that we ought to have been given a heads-up on that.  What did the Minister propose to do if EUROSTAT turned it down?I do not object in principle to the notion of the Minister trying to arrange the financing in a fashion that does not compromise the already extremely high national debt figures.  I wish to make that clear, but I have difficulty with the way it has emerged.  The points in the amendment that Deputy Bruton has adduced are immensely important.  In the context of that question I asked the Minister about Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks contriving to get us to shed their toxic assets and then they run the show, we need to look at the question of the suitability of investors as envisaged in line (a) of the amendment.  The reference in line (b) to the suitability and behaviour of members of the board is just as important.  This puts An Bord Pleanála, the National Roads Authority and other such bodies in the ha’penny place.The Minister indicated to me on Committee Stage that he envisages the chairman of NAMA will be the chairman of the SPV but he never explained in detail how he can provide for all of that in the shareholder's agreement.  A number of other matters arise in the amendment to which Deputies Bruton and Burton have spoken and I do not wish to go back over that but it is very important.  If the reason that the Minister did not give tangible expression to this in the Bill when he first published it was because he did not have the approval from EUROSTAT, now that he has the approval why resist incorporating in the law the amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton or something like it?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	588	It is beginning to make more sense to me now why the Minister refused to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment on putting the Oireachtas committee on a statutory basis.  Part of the proposal put forward was to review the shareholder's agreement undertaken by the master special purpose vehicle.  That confirms my suspicions that something tricky is going on.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever been to the Grand National in Fairyhouse at Easter time but there is a tradition that when one exits Fairyhouse there is a line of people called the three-card trick merchants.  I am sure the Minister has seen them.  That is precisely what all of this is about.  This is three-card trick stuff.In case Members have not had an opportunity to read the note supplied by the Minister, this master special purpose vehicle has wide powers.  There is no mention of a special purpose vehicle in the interpretation section.  In fact, the only reference is to a NAMA group entity, whatever that means.  It states in the briefing note on NAMA SPV structures that, "The master SPV will be a separate legal entity and will be jointly owned by private investors, who will own 51% of its ordinary equity, and by NAMA, which will hold the remaining 49% ordinary equity".  My definition of a legal entity is that it is named.  What is the name of the master special purpose vehicle?  That is not a name for a separate legal entity.  There has to be a name.  There will have to be directors of a company named such and such.  It is extraordinary that we have not been given a name for this special purpose vehicle.I refer colleagues to page 2 of the note that was circulated.  It relates to comments from EUROSTAT and it states:EUROSTAT'S ESA 95 paragraph 2.12 sets out the rules whereby an entity can be considered an institutional unit which would merit the achievement of an off-balance sheet structure [it goes on to specify] ... A resident unit is regarded as constituting an institutional unit if it has decision-making autonomy in respect of its principal function, and either keeps a complete set of accounts or it would be possible and meaningful, from both an economic and legal viewpoint, to compile a complete set of accounts if they were required.  In order to be said to have autonomy of decision in respect of its principal functions a unit must: a) be entitled to own goods or assets in its own right; it will therefore be able to exchange the ownership of goods or assets in transactions with other institutional units; b) be able to take economic decisions and engage in economic activities for which it is itself held to be directly responsible and accountable at law.That confirms exactly what I said on Committee Stage, that in order to get approval from EUROSTAT this company not alone has to be a separate legal entity with its own board of directors and with a name, but it must also be able to take economic decisions and engage in economic activities for which it is itself held to be directly responsible and accountable at law.  That is the most important statement.  In other words, according to EUROSTAT if a developer wants to question why his or her properties are being confiscated by this body, that company, the SPV, that is named and is a separate legal unit is accountable at law.  Therefore, the business of a NAMA group entity being sufficient is a con trick.  That company must be named, have separate legal authority and be accountable at law, according to the Minister's note, under EUROSTAT requirements to merit the achievement of an off-balance sheet structure.  The failure of the Minister to bring forward an amendment on this Stage clearly outlining the responsibilities of this animal known as the "master SPV", which is without a name and is not mentioned in the interpretation section of the Bill, must be corrected immediately if the Minister wishes to use the excuse that the reason he is doing this is to take these liabilities off-balance sheet.  Otherwise, according to EUROSTAT, it will not achieve that status.The Minister's note to Members states that the master SPV will be a separate legal entity, entitled to own goods and assets in its own right and will have autonomy of decision in its day-to-day operations.  How does that fit in with what the Minister is now telling us, that the NAMA board can veto all decisions of the SPV?  That is totally contradictory to the requirement of EUROSTAT, which clearly states that it must be accountable at law in itself because it is a separate legal entity with its own board and shareholders.  Not alone do we not know who the shareholders are, we do not know who the directors will be.  In one part of the note the Minister tells us that NAMA representatives on the board will maintain a veto over all decisions of the board that could affect the interests of NAMA while in the next part of the same note, he tells us that the SPV will have complete autonomy, will be able to incur liabilities on its behalf and will have complete accounting information available.  That does not add up.I cannot understand how we are expected to pass legislation relating to a company which is a legal entity with no name and that is not mentioned in the legislation.  The only matter mentioned in the legislation is the definition of a NAMA group entity, which states that it is a subsidiary of NAMA within the meaning given by section 115 of the Companies Act 1963.  If it is a subsidiary of NAMA it does not comply with what EUROSTAT states in its ESA 95, paragraph 2.12.  This sets out the rules whereby an entity can be considered an institutional unit which would merit the achievement of an off-balance sheet structure.  It goes on to state what the entity can and must do.  That does not comply with what the Minister tells us in his note.  There is no mention of this company in the legislation we are being asked to pass this week.This is a con trick.  It is no wonder the Minister does not want a statutory Dáil or Oireachtas committee that can question all the issues Deputy Bruton outlined in his amendment, which was defeated in the last division.  It is an absolute shame.  This is not the type of legislation that can be easily amended.  It is putting the taxpayers of this country at risk to the tune of €54 billion and possibly more.  We are being treated as if we are being disloyal to the State by asking awkward questions, but we have an obligation to ensure that this legislation will, as far as is humanly possible, protect the interests of taxpayers.I have read the Minister's note carefully and I invite others to read it and tell me if am misreading it.  It clearly states what the requirements of EUROSTAT are regarding the formation of this legal entity, which has complete authority, a board of directors and shareholders.  It even goes so far as to state that the subscribed capital of the master SPV is "likely to be" €100 million.  It is as if the Minister has not yet made up his mind or it might not be possible to get the €100 million.  This is extraordinary.  The note continues: "The Master SPV will have its own Board with members appointed by NAMA (maybe the whole NAMA board of 9) and the Private Sector equity investors."  Nobody mentions who they are or how many directors there will be.  It continues: "...the NAMA representatives on the Board will maintain a veto over all decisions of the Board...".  Then one reads what EUROSTAT says is required to qualify as a legal entity and the conditions that must be fulfilled.  There is no way they can be adhered to in view of the Minister's note and the lack of any information in the legislation concerning this matter.

It offers the Government an opportunity to include it in the Bill to ensure there is some type of clarity and oversight regarding what these SPVs may do.  I believe the SPV will take power from NAMA.  It will take the driver and engine from NAMA and leave it like a shell.  It is a completely separate entity.Why is that happening?  Obviously, we were misled on Second Stage when there was no mention of this.  When it emerged over the past couple of weeks I wondered——

We would give the Minister no credit for that because the Green Party was not going to ruffle any feathers once it got through its conference.  However, it is far more serious than that.There are only vague references in the Bill to NAMA group entities.  There is nothing that ties the SPVs into NAMA in a way that would be necessary for purposes of scrutiny.  I am mystified by the Attorney General's advice to the Minister that it is all covered and I would not be surprised if that was tested at some stage in the near future.  In fact, the President might consider referring the legislation to the Supreme Court to check these matters.  It certainly seems suspicious.I will try to avoid repeating the points that have been made.  We are told not to worry and that all is safe because the NAMA directors in the SPV will have a veto.  Members of this House will be aware that there are many opportunities to frustrate vetoes; one ends up cutting a deal.  The taxpayers cannot afford any more deals with the people who are likely to be the directors of the SPV.  Obviously, we do not yet know who they are but the Minister will understand if there are suspicions on this side of the House, at least on my part, in respect of who they might be.  The Fine Gael amendment is an opportunity to correct this and to make this body accountable.  I hope the Minister accepts it.

The Minister has, unintentionally I presume, caused some problems for the Green Party, which engaged in a fulsome debate and adopted a thorough process of analysis in respect of what was contained in the Bill, as drafted.  Many of the views taken on board were genuinely held by the party's membership.

However, there are valid questions to be posed in respect of the make-up of the SPV and also with regard to the fact that a number of mini-SPVs may be established.  The more of these vehicles there are in existence, the less influence the Oireachtas will have on the process.I agree with Fine Gael Deputies in respect of the need for strong committee regulation without, as stated earlier, there being a need for control to be exerted in respect of every minor matter.  Will the Minister indicate if a committee will be in a position to engage in a thorough discussion with representatives of the SPV?  Would a committee be in a position to invite these people or those representing the mini-SPVs to come before it in order to answer questions about their activities?  To what level will the Oireachtas or its committee have power to examine matters in detail?  Will the quarterly reports to be provided merely cover the NAMA "holding company", so to speak, or will they include details on how the SPV and the mini-SPVs operate?  If the SPV continues to be subdivided ad infinitum, how will it be possible to regulate, control and monitor matters?The SPV constitutes an attempt to clarify that what is involved here is a special loan which should not be included as part of the State's overall liability on a year-to-year basis.  At the same time, it goes some way towards making provision for risk equalisation.  The Green Party was criticised in respect of the additional €7 billion and €2.8 billion was quoted as being the magic figure in this regard.  I am aware of the issues relating to contingent liability.  Another issue relates to the 51%-49% shareholding in respect of the advent of private sector involvement.  We cannot pre-empt any decision in respect of this matter but at some stage there will be increased shareholdings in the Irish banks.  If those banks do well, then the risks involved will be shared through other means.There has been much debate with regard to the valuation and the amount we are paying above that figure.  In one sense, this is something of a red herring.  Most Members would agree that there is a need to recapitalise the banks.  If the money must be invested in any event, then a question arises with regard to what is the cheapest way to procure loans.  I am of the view that the NAMA scheme, by means of which preferential loans can be obtained through the issuing of bonds, offers the cheapest way.  Deputy Burton stated that this may actually increase——

Following enactment of the NAMA legislation, the spate of repossessions will rise with families, who should be encouraged and assisted to remain in their homes, being forced on to the street.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	653	This is factual despite what Deputy Thomas Byrne and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh had to say yesterday in this House.  I want to know if the Minister has plans to introduce a NAMA-style rescue plan for the countless hard-working taxpayers whose money the Government squandered?  Implementation of the Fine Gael home owners support schemewould allow NAMA to take an equity share in a property following negotiations with the relevant financial institution in relation to the outstanding debt.  The scheme would give the home owner the option to buy back the NAMA equity share and if the property is subsequently sold, NAMA would gain its share of the sale price.There is no point offering piecemeal assistance to those in danger of repossession.  Legislation on the lines of the Fine Gael NAMA support scheme needs to be introduced to rescue the victims of the Celtic tiger cronyism. Unless such rescue packages are enshrined in law, help will continue to be inconsistent and those most in need will continue to fall through the net.  This is not acceptable with up to 35,000 families currently in mortgage arrears.According to yesterday's The Irish Times, 18 of 76 repossession orders were granted in the High Court on Monday, 2 November 2009, the highest number in a single day this year.  What makes these cases particularly extraordinary is the fact that 11 of the properties were already vacant as homeowners had simply walked away.  The despair of owners, unable to cope, was highlighted by one case involving a property that was abandoned and the hall door left open.Another matter relevant to this debate that needs to be urgently addressed in the current economic climate is the imprisonment of impoverished people for debt.  Many are in negative equity and in difficulties caused by lifestyle-related borrowings and excessive use of credit cards, but imprisoning them is not the answer.  Over-indebtedness has become a massive problem due to job losses, irresponsible lending and financial over-commitment.This morning, I spoke to a separated woman with four children who lives in my constituency.  She fell on hard times and had her home repossessed by the bank who sold it for less than €100,000 and is now demanding a further €175,000 from her, with the threat of imprisonment hanging over her, which is scandalous.  What way is this to treat vulnerable people?  How low can this Government go?  Is there no end to the harassment of the weakest to support the strongest?Complete reform of action against debtors, in line with the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, is urgently needed.  This has been promised in the renewed programme for Government.  It is hoped the Minister can assure us this will be done.  The proposal to establish a central debt enforcement office to remove as many debt enforcement proceedings as possible from the courts is welcome.As is the norm, the Government has its head in the sand when it comes to the protection of the lower and middle income earners.  We heard the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, deny that there was an escalation in repossessions and of course he made no mention of the likely increase in such repossessions when NAMA is passed.  The Minister of State also admitted that comprehensive statistics on mortgage repossessions have not been kept, which seems at the very least——

We heard more waffle from the Green Party in this regard a few minutes ago, with Deputy Gogarty speaking out of the two sides of his mouth.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	656	Following on from the Report Stage debate on NAMA and previous discussions in regard to NAMA master and minor SPVs — I am not quite sure how many SPVs there are — and the rounds of the earth to which the Government has gone to facilitate the banks and large developers, it is difficult for ordinary people and families experiencing serious financial challenges to understand why they are being left to go to MABs, which neither has the resources — there is a waiting list of some months for its service — nor the statutory authority to negotiate deferred payments on behalf of individuals.  It is difficult when one meets people on the street to defend an opinion that the more one owes the more protected one is and that the person who owes only a mortgage is at the mercy of the banks without any protection.While I commend the Labour Party on its motion, the Fine Gael proposal to protect home owners reflects the obligation of the banks to acknowledge that during the so-called boom years they loaned money recklessly, providing 100% mortgages over 30 years and more often than not with a current account which ensured people would be in a position to make interest-only payments and would never or, at least for some considerable time, be able to reduce the capital amount of the loan.  This happened in the good times.  Now, people who are losing their jobs, paying extra levies and tax, taking reductions in pay are struggling and being criminalised.  The housing agency, Respond, estimates that the number of people in this position is 25,000 although the figure varies and is often quoted as 35,000.  The Government, however, says the true figure is less than that.  Nevertheless, it is possibly a figure that is increasing all the time as unemployment and other factors kick in.The Fine Gael proposal is that NAMA would take an equity share following a suitable write-down in the mortgage to reflect the reckless manner in which the mortgage was given.  The reality is first-time buyers who purchased a home between 2002 and 2008, when property prices were falsely inflated, are caught in a spike.  These are the people who as a cohort are more than likely, if the two parents are working, to have children in child care and who, if not working, had extended themselves and are now under severe pressure.  These people must be protected.  The six month code which comes into effect when people fall into arrears is no good because they will not be able to get out of the mess in such a short period.The moratorium, worthy and all that it is, only defers payments.  The proposed home owners protection element of our amendment to the NAMA legislation would allow home owners to opt to continue to make payments at a level they can afford, for NAMA to take an equity share in the remainder and allow the home owners, if they return to an income level which would allow them pay the full amount, to repay NAMA.  Also, in the event that the property is sold NAMA would realise its share if a profit is made.  This appears to be an equitable proposal.The Government appears to have buried its head a little, given that its amendment commends the Government on its actions to stabilise the financial system and to restore the public finances thereby protecting jobs and home ownership, which is very laudable.  However, yesterday there were fluctuations in the financial institutions' stock value.  One cannot state that the actions taken have stabilised anything at this stage.  I urge the Government to rethink the issue and to take on board both proposals put forward.

We must ensure they now recognise it is not in the interests of householders, the country or banks for us to have a huge scale of closures of mortgages on family homes.  As we said in the revised programme for Government, we will take up initiatives such as those that have existed in places like the United States or the United Kingdom.  Such mechanisms might include those whereby the banks, rather than foreclosing on a property, would consider a debt equity swap.  They could take an equity share in the property and in that way avoid families having to leave their homes.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	663	Banks must consider a change in terms and in mechanisms.  We have given a clear commitment towards introducing that type of system here.  We have also recognised that we need to go beyond that and beyond the Labour Party motion as set out.  We must take up the very good advice from the Law Reform Commission with regard to wider changes within the area of our debt management and solvency system.  We must get away from a court-based system that works for no-one and introduce the type of arbitration and mediation services into debt management that will help people through a difficult phase.  That approach would be far better for the country.It is not right in these difficult times to try to put people down for 12 years under old 19th century debt, solvency and bankruptcy laws.  It would be far better to help them manage through that phase and get back on their feet and working again.  That is what we have committed to in the revised programme for Government.  We have committed to taking up the recommendations which have been presented in detail and thought through by the Law Reform Commission.Obviously, the attention of the House has been drawn to the legislation and to the difficult issues that must be addressed, but make no mistake, it would be remiss of us to neglect the decisions that must be taken for the people on budgeting and banking areas.  We are as equally committed to protecting individuals who are in debt, restoring confidence in the country and getting people working again, which is our first objective in Government.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	664	We all know that one of people's most terrifying fears is that of losing their homes.  We know this is true from our meetings with people in our constituencies.  We have a duty to protect these people and we will do that.  I welcome this timely debate and thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch for raising the issue.  The debate is occurring in a context when many people are extremely depressed and worried about the level of debt they accrued during the boom years, money that was lent recklessly by the banks.  Many people who built big houses have now lost their jobs and are having great difficulty repaying their mortgages.  People who built more modest homes have also lost jobs and are in trouble.There are many different types of debt, including personal and mortgage debts.  We know from the Law Reform Commission that in 1995 the ratio of household debt to disposable income stood at 48%, a staggering statistic.  However, now in 2009 this has risen to 106%.  We have gone from being 17th on an international league table of personal indebtedness to fourth, which is extraordinary.  We must blame the reckless attitudes of some banks and mortgage providers for this.  The problems being experienced in recent years have not helped.  There is nothing new in that.  All these things are cyclical.There is much anecdotal evidence that approaches to people in financial difficulty by some banking personnel have been crude and extreme.  We know the banks lent fast and furiously, but when the customers or clients got into trouble, the banks hounded them for gross repayments.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs was given an excellent presentation some weeks ago by a financial adviser named Liam Croke.  He provided many examples of banks and mortgage providers who told people they could not get help or make different financial arrangements, such as facilitating reduced payments, until they had gone into arrears.  That is a nonsensical approach that must be stopped.  A thread running through many of the cases he mentioned was that banks and mortgage providers were threatening and extreme with customers but adopted a far more conciliatory approach with financial advisers and third parties.  I do not stand for that and we should not stand for it.Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said the number of repossessions had not increased dramatically and that sub-prime lenders were involved in the majority of such cases.

I know a man who was in negotiation with his bank and the bank subsequently sent him on to a bigger bank in Dublin, the head office.  While he was negotiating and trying to restructure his loans, the bank cut off his credit cards and said if he put his card into the ATM he would not get any money.  It stopped his credit.  It is a nonsense that this can happen in the middle of negotiation.  We must stop such actions and ensure people with genuine difficulties are treated sympathetically by our banks.  That must happen.Money management education programmes providing advice on how to handle reduced incomes have been initiated for people taking redundancy.  I welcome this.  We have moved from such a high standard of living and hit the bottom with such a crash that people are bewildered and frightened by the speed at which this has happened.  As one of the negotiators for the revised programme for Government, I am glad we are looking intently at mortgage protection measures and for a review of the existing code of conduct between the Irish Banking Federation and MABS outlets throughout the country on debt default.  People feel vulnerable about their homes and their level of debt.  In the context of the NAMA legislation, we must ensure that lending will continue so that businesses can keep people in employment and they, in turn, can repay their mortgages.  We must ensure this financial circle continues.  I look forward to seeing the final report of the Law Reform Commission on the reform of debt enforcement and its proposal on responsible borrowing and lending.We need to ensure new, rigorous implementation of financial regulation so that banks no longer throw loans at people.  That may not be supposed to be happening, but a person came to my constituency office who was offered a 100% mortgage last week.  The Minister must ensure that does not happen again.

We must remember when we draw up codes, regulations and procedures that we are dealing with people, not commodities, broken dreams and not just statistics.  Many people in trouble now are in despair because of the reckless attitudes of our banks.  We have a chance now to change that.  The banks need to know that we will enforce tough measures if they employ heavy-handedness towards people to whom they so casually and extravagantly lent money.

When there is uncertainty over income and employment, losing one's home is difficult to countenance.  I am relieved to note that so far only 20 home repossessions have taken place among the institutions covered by the bank guarantee.  Therefore, based on these statistics, repossession is not as widespread a problem as  suggested.The Government has protections in place.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has moved from voluntary to statutory and applies to all regulated lenders.  It provides a scheme through which borrowers and lenders work together to rectify the situation and sets in place a plan for clearing built up arrears.  It talks about the broader point of repossession being the last resort.  It is important to get the message out that if anyone is in difficulty, the first thing to do is to sit down with the lender and work through it.  There is an onus on the lender to do that, which is crucial as a first port of call.I note from recent court reports where a couple had fallen into debt that the judge refused to allow a repossession order so there is judicial discretion.  The Judiciary is working to avoid repossessions.  I note comments from the free legal advice centres, that they are getting a huge number of calls to their information lines.  People are seeking information and it is important it is available to them so it is clear what is happening.Deputy Mary White pointed out that there is good wording in the programme for Government that must be delivered into both regulation and legislation to protect those who are in financial difficulty.  There is a menu of choices in the programme for Government, whether it be the bank taking equity, rolling up the outstanding interest, longer maturity dates, reduced rates or lease backs.  All of these are being examined and we will choose from the menu to ensure that people are as well protected as possible.The political system and decisions over the past 15 years contributed to the problem that arose.  The Green Party in its policy instruments in the late 1990s and during the early 2000s stated clearly that change was necessary, to legislate for and regulate mortgages to ensure people were not duped into difficult situations.  I am worried at the moment, however, that the banks are not doing sufficient stress testing and that they are allowed to offer 100% mortgages or mortgages over 40 years.  I am not convinced due diligence is operating.  I receive Garda Review and from reading it I see that financial institutions are still offering 100% mortgages.  That can put people in a vulnerable situation where they may have the income now but in four or five years circumstances may change and they might find themselves in difficulty.This Government, however, will legislate and regulate where appropriate to ensure people are better protected.  We are half way through a process of considering many of these options, we have the Law Reform Commission report and it has specific recommendations.  I am sure my colleagues in Government will act on those.I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion during Private Members' business.  It is a good time to discuss these issues, before any trickle turns into a flood.  We must act as a Government and take action to protect the vulnerable and to protect families.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I also commend Deputy Ciarán Lynch and the Labour Party on tabling a motion on this pertinent issue.  I acknowledge that many people are in a grave financial situation, drowning in personal debt, the principal component of which, in most cases, is the mortgage.  People who have lost their employment or are suffering from a loss of income or reduced income through reduced hours or increased taxation in recent budgets, coupled with the fact that many people paid over-inflated prices for their property, have combined with the result that very many people are in negative equity and finding it difficult to make their monthly mortgage payments.It is frightening to see the statistic that up to 16,000 people are in arrears of 90 days or more.  It is clear that while the number of repossessions to date has been low, it is inevitable that there will be a time lag between the onset of the recession and when it begins to affect people, leading to an inability to make mortgage repayments and proceedings being taken by the financial institutions towards repossession.  It is also inevitable that we will see more cases, we must be honest about that.It is incumbent on us, as legislators, to provide assistance in terms of policy in a measured and proportionate way.  That is what we must do in a responsible fashion and what this Government seeks to do.  It is important to acknowledge that there are already significant supports in place through the mortgage interest supplement scheme, a practical support for people that gives cash to them to assist with their mortgage interest requirements.  Almost 14,000 families are benefiting from that today and it is a significant contribution by the State to assist people who are facing difficulties.  We are all aware of the good work the 65 MABS offices are doing for people who find themselves in difficulty.The statutory code on mortgage arrears was introduced earlier this year and it contains tangible provisions that are of assistance to people when it comes to their debt.  It states clearly that all genuine cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her obligations and that the lender must explore a number of options before initiating any proceedings, including changes to the level of monthly repayment, deferral of the payment itself, extending the term of the mortgage and changing the type of mortgage.  All of those avenues must be explored before a lender is permitted under the code to initiate proceedings.  It is important that people get every reasonable opportunity to meet their mortgage commitments and we must encourage people, as soon as they think they are in difficulty, to come forward and engage with the institutions and with MABS to find a way to work through the loan and to overcome the difficulties, which are hopefully temporary.Some Deputies referred to the commitments in the new programme for Government that require further thought and analysis.  Some of them have potential, particularly the idea of the bank taking an equity interest in the house thereby releasing an appropriate percentage of the mortgage.We have a great love of owning our own home in this country, a tradition that does not exist elsewhere in Europe.  Over time we will see shifts in our society towards new models of property possession and occupancy and we are beginning to see the roots of that.  The model we should work towards is one of maximum flexibility between the borrower and the lender, where the lender is compelled to work with the borrower to identify an appropriate solution on a case-by-case basis.  Such a model, however, cannot involve the writing off of any element of the debt because that would be a dangerous signal to send out.  To be fair, no Deputy has suggested that, because many people who are making their mortgage payments are doing so by the skin of their teeth and if we sent out a signal that it was acceptable to miss payments, that there was another way out, it would set a dangerous precedent.We must have an appropriate response that is sympathetic to the genuine needs of families who are in difficulty to provide a clear path for them to work their way through the difficulty.  The last thing any of us wants to see is a family losing its home, the most important asset it possesses.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion and I thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch for tabling it.  There is a common concern on all sides of the House about the concerns of home owners who are in financial difficulties.It is important to state that there are people in that category who have genuine concerns.  Everyone has recognised that the most important thing is to approach the financial institution as early as possible to discuss issues rather than to let problems accumulate.  Many people still in good employment are able to meet their monthly mortgage repayments.  Ireland has historically been good in this area because Irish people want to own their homes.  We should not create unnecessary fear in the population, especially in those who do not have a problem, by dwelling too much on an issue that is serious but does not affect the majority of householders.Judges dealing with some financial institutions in court have been astounded at the reckless behaviour of the banks issuing the loans.  Those cases did not proceed because the banks got the message that they should go home and negotiate rather than march into court to seek a repossession.  That is one reason for the banks to be happy to negotiate voluntary agreements because they will get no sympathy from judges who see the level of mortgages they granted to some who clearly could not have paid them.  They were unsustainable from day one.  Banks are still giving 100% mortgages.  I would have been happy in the past if the mortgages were only for 100% but the banks were giving 130% mortgages which they justified on the basis that the property market would continue to increase by 20% or 30% over the following two years and the mortgages would then be worth 100%.Each of us must have met people in our clinics who not only have 100% mortgages but the cost of whose weddings, honeymoons, two car loans and credit card bills were all lumped into the mortgage.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I have met people in my constituency office who have 130% mortgages.  I would love to see some of those cases going to court where a responsible judge would tell the banks that they had entered unenforceable contracts.  I am one of the few in this House who has no fear for somebody going to court because the day of people being afraid of the banks should be over.  The banks must do the bidding of the people from now on, not the other way around.We should not simplistically point the finger at the banks because we all have a responsibility.  Several local authorities have repossessed houses in the past year and previously.  In some cases they move more quickly and sharply than some of the commercial banks.  Some of the sub-prime lenders were very reckless.  Many of us have dealt with cases of people whose community welfare officers granted them a mortgage interest subsidy.  Some, however, have been refused and gone to the social welfare appeals office.  In those cases the community welfare officers tell people they should not have got their mortgages because they were not sustainable and the banks should not have entered into that agreement.  Community welfare officers, who are not financial experts, use their common sense in saying that banks were reckless.In fairness to the banks they have recently been doing more than they want to admit publically.  In the past year or two I have heard of many cases in which the bank has taken back equity in a house and let it to the customer so that not even the next-door neighbours knew.  The banks probably do not want to say this up front because they do not want to be seen as a soft touch.  Those figures are probably well hidden in the bowels of the banks but it is happening because the last thing the banks want is empty houses for sale because then they will lose through negative equity.There is a high penalty for transferring from a fixed to a variable rate when it suits a person to do so.  Local authorities, however, charge the same penalties.I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  The renewed programme for Government is the way to deal with this problem in the months and years ahead.

The social welfare system is helping many people in difficulties.  There is also the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which has successfully been advising people for years.  Statistics have been thrown about but the number of people who have lost their houses per capita is way below that in our neighbouring jurisdiction.  While that is a statistic we must recognise that individuals and families are faced with the threat of repossession, having lost their jobs and being unable to pay their mortgages.  They need help.Respond! recently gave a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service about how we should change our system in order to help and protect people.  The presentation has been sent to the Department of Finance and deserves serious consideration.  The Government could put many of its proposals into operation.  The Law Reform Commission is also examining how to deal with debt repayments.  We must consider all these studies in order to create a system that will help people who are in trouble.In the programme for Government, the Government has committed itself to introducing new measures to protect families having difficulty with their repayments.  I urge the Government to immediately work on those propositions to allay the fears of people, many of whom will hopefully not lose their homes as the economy picks up.  The Government should get a proper programme going to help those in trouble and offer light at the end of the tunnel.  I think the banks recognise that repossessing homes and throwing people out on the highways and byways is not profitable for them.  If the banks and building societies want to make a profit they should keep people in their houses.  I will not enter any further philosophical discussion on that issue.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion and to assure it that in principle I support it.

A high percentage of them have recently lost their jobs or businesses and are no longer able to pay the high mortgages on their homes.  The finance houses, banks, building societies and sub-prime lenders will take off their sheep's clothing and be seen for the greedy wolves that they are, mercilessly pursuing the home owner for every last penny due.  Home owners will be dragged before the courts where their homes will be taken from them and be left then with the further debt arising from the negative equity on their homes.The Labour Party motion, if passed and implemented, would take the first steps in preventing this inevitable scenario.  Last night I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, reading a script outlining the Government's position.  I was somewhat surprised the Office of Public Works has taken over responsibility for housing.  His speech was pathetic.  It refused to accept or recognise the reality of the crisis facing thousands of families whose homes are threatened, instead claiming there was no practice of mass evictions in modern Ireland.  It stressed we should be careful lest we upset the banks as it may affect our credit rating.Either the Government is blind to reality or it could not give a damn about the little people.  The Government could find €54 billion to bail out the banks and its friends, the developers and builders.  As far as those home owners in trouble are concerned, it is a case of let the devil take the hindmost.  For this Government, the home owner with a mortgage he cannot pay is the hindmost and can go to the devil.Deputy Willie Penrose in a forceful contribution to this debate described the financial carousel that faced the home seeker during our period of financial madness when second-hand council houses could change hands for up to €500,000.  Home buyers were faced with the might and resources of the finance houses and developers only to be poorly served by the surveyors and solicitors they hired.  Banks with their sheep's clothing on shovelled money at the home buyers, convincing them to buy now before there was another increase in price.In one instance I know of in my area, a developer increased the price of houses in one day by €20,000 per unit.  The banks sanctioned the extra loans and mortgages over the mobile telephones of purchasers.  The response was simply, "Get in quick, no problem with the extra money".  I am sure some bank manager got a bonus for that nice deal.  The builder certainly did.The sheep's clothing is off now and we can see the greedy wolves for what they are while the Government says not to disturb the bankers.  All of this could have been prevented and avoided.  The Government played a key role in creating and magnifying the problem which is now a crisis.  If the Government had implemented the Kenny report on building land, thereby controlling its price, regulated the financial institutions and not adopted the McCreevy light-finger regulation, none of this would have occurred.  Of course, Fianna Fáil never had any intention of doing so as it would have offended their paymasters in the Galway Races tent.  Now the home owner must pick up the tab and is abandoned by the Government.  The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government has been derelict in its duty.The stark reality is that tens of thousands of families are unable to pay their mortgages.  They must be housed somewhere which they can afford.  Instead of them swelling the lists for RAS, rent subsidy or social housing, the Labour Party argues the best option is to let them stay where they have already established their homes with their families.  In turn, they should be allowed to pay what they can afford and when their situation improves they can resume full payments on their mortgages.Unfortunately, during our period of financial madness, houses were used as a common commodity to be speculated on, to invest in and to increase the wealth of those already well-off.  If the speculators are in trouble now, they will not get any sympathy from me.  A home is not just a piece of real estate or property.  A home is usually a once-in-a-lifetime purchase where families put down roots and become part of a community.  It is where family members love one another and children are born and reared to adulthood.  It is the place where members of a family are protected, cared for and can feel secure.  A home is a permanent place of shelter, the roof over one's head and the place to where everyone returns.  The right to a home is a basic human right.  To treat a home as just another piece of property that can be given or taken away at the behest of a financial institution is immoral.  It is the denial to that right to a home and shelter.  I urge the Government to seriously think again before rejecting this Labour Party motion.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch for tabling this motion.  It seems hard-pressed home owners do not have the same direct line to the Government that the bankers have even when they end up bankrupting the State's largest banks.This Labour Party Private Members' motion seeks fairness and protection for the people bearing the brunt of the economic catastrophe for which this Government, the developers and the bankers are largely responsible.  When one engages in dodgy dealing, bringing the banks to their knees one is retired to a golf course.  However, those who have lost their jobs or were panicked into getting onto the mystical property ladder by a coalition of developers, mortgage lenders, Fianna Fáil politicians and newspapers, live in fear of being pursued to the fullest extent of the law.A potential crisis is looming.  The numbers of mortgage holders estimated to be in arrears is roughly 35,000.  This includes families with young children, many living in half-finished estates on the edge of towns far from where they used to work.  Last Monday, we witnessed the largest number of home repossession for the year so far, 18.  The banks which are to avail of the NAMA bailout are merely waiting for the ink to dry on the transfer of toxic debt to the State before they begin vigorously pursuing those who have mortgage arrears.  They do this to shore up their asset base to make themselves more appealing to the stock market, not for the good of the country to which they are now beholden for bailing them out.  Neither do they have any concern for unfortunate mortgage holders who cannot keep up with their repayments.The core value of the Labour Party's motion on which we will vote tonight is that whenever possible the family should be assisted to continue residing in its own home.  It is of no benefit to the bank to evict someone when they will not be able to sell the house.  It would be much better and more responsible to attempt to establish a new mortgage agreement, one which can be met in the longer term.  It is certainly of no benefit to the State if we see waves of people evicted from their homes.  Thousands are already waiting on social housing lists across the country, some for almost a decade.  The McCarthy report threatens to close family resource centres and our suicide prevention strategy was recently exposed as a sham by a report in the Irish Examiner.  In short, as a society we are not ready for the wave of repossessions that are likely to occur in the new year once NAMA is whipped through this House.This motion seeks some fairness for hard-pressed mortgage holders.  Where they are trying to pay they should be given time and space from the fear of eviction and the spectre of sleeping rough, since we have never implemented all of the recommendations of the homelessness strategy.  In many cases the banks and other mortgage lenders, not in NAMA, went crazy in sub-prime lending.  I know of one case where a woman on a community employment scheme was given a top-up mortgage of €170,000.  She never had any real chance of paying it back.  Now the benevolent mortgage provider is looking for its pound of flesh.  This means leaving this woman and her children homeless.Surely some of the Government backbenchers are in touch with the real world.  While listening to some of them this evening, I became convinced they will be supporting this motion.   Every day at our advice clinics we meet the people who, having lost their jobs, see no hope in the short term of keeping up repayments.  These people need assurances that they will not be evicted and end up on the homeless list.  Our responsibilities and duties are to everyone in the State and not merely to the well connected.  These people must be given some breathing space.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I wish to cite two examples of the type of person who now needs assistance, who differs greatly from the type of person who needed assistance in the past.  A story published in last Saturday's edition of the Irish Independent 
outlined the difficulties faced by a man and his wife who had taken out a mortgage.  The man had a monthly salary of €4,700 and monthly mortgage repayments of €1,500 on a  €230,000 mortgage.  He worked in construction, but lost his job.   He has credit card debts of €16,000.  He now has a weekly wage of €400.  If he were to sell his house, he would make no more than €180,000, which would be €60,000 less than the value of his mortgage.  A credit card company telephoned him and offered him a  €10,000 credit limit, which he accepted at the time.I know of a similar case in my office involving a young couple.  One partner who is a carpenter worked in construction.  The couple purchased a house for more than €300,000 and they have monthly mortgage repayments of €1,500.  The partner who worked in construction on losing his job applied for jobseeker's benefit and was only given such benefit for 12 months.  When he applied for jobseeker's allowance and account was taken of his partner's income, that brought him just over the qualifying income limit.  The couple were turned down for mortgage interest supplement and family income supplement, for which they were just over the qualifying income limit.  They are now in severe financial difficulties, have mortgage arrears and cannot pay their bills.  Their mortgage repayment protection policy has run out and they are in dire straits.These cases are extreme in one sense but they are becoming typical and will become more so.  We need to adjust to this new type of person who needs assistance.  In a sense they are the new poor.  Some of these people are in receipt of social welfare payments now, never having been in receipt of them previously, and more of these people are not in receipt of any form of social welfare assistance.  There is much talk about the need to protect the poor and we need to do that.  Traditionally, that has been taken to be people on low incomes, social welfare recipients and often people living in social housing or people who have low mortgages.  We also need to protect people who, traditionally, were middle-income earners who have now fallen on hard times.  We seem to forget that the ratio of mortgage payments to income in the case of middle-income earners is far greater than it was in the past, even though these people might appear to have good incomes — although they incurred reductions recently — compared to incomes 30 years ago.  That is all a product of the housing bubble and the Celtic tiger.  We need to protect those people.  Our system is not geared towards protecting those new families who are experiencing difficulties.The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has a comment on its website, which I find striking, to the effect that some conferences working with individuals and families, who did not benefit from the boom, are experiencing little change in their workload.  I am not surprised by that because the position of a person on a social welfare income, living in social housing a few years ago and his or her position now has not changed much.  We need to protect those people.  Deputy Gilmore raised that issue this morning.  We must continue the progress being made in lifting those people out of poverty and make sure that relative poverty does not increase.  In doing that, we do not want to allow the middle income group to fall into poverty, whereby we would have a reduced middle income group.  We talk about the middle class but often these are people in the middle who have huge mortgages and outgoings.  We need to remember that these people are now struggling.The Minister's response to the difficulties faced by such people is often to refer to MABS or the mortgage interest supplement, but many of these people do not qualify for that supplement.  In its pre-budget submission, MABS refers to helping the poor, its clients mainly being people on low income and social welfare recipients living in social housing.  It does not cater for the new type of person facing financial difficulties.  Much of that is related to the geography of where its offices are based, which tend to be in the more disadvantaged areas.  There is no MABS office in Lucan where many people are losing their jobs.  Lucan would be very representative of the commuter belt where people are in difficulty.  We need to gear up our system to deal with the new type of people who are facing financial difficulties.  We need to provide them with assistance, the type that Deputy Ciarán Lynch outlined in his motion.  This is not a short-term problem that can be dealt with by providing more staff, MABS or a 12 month grace period in respect of home repossessions.  This is going to be a long-term problem.  We need to restructure our system to help these people pay their mortgages.  We need to consider mechanisms such as the State or the banks taking an equity in these people's houses to allow them a longer period to pay off their mortgage.  We must do something to address this issue which will become a growing problem.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of this motion tabled by my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  It is astonishing that people would speak with apparent compassion yet be ready at 8.30 p.m. to vote down a motion.  If there was an ounce of sensitivity and reality shown for the position of people who are threatened with repossession of their homes, the Government would accept this motion.  It would make whatever changes it wished to it.  It is a modest proposal.  It involved bringing forward a scheme which would address the issue and put proper obligations on the banking system, yet the Government will not do that.This motion is being debated in the middle of Report Stage of the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  That is interesting and tells one a great deal.  When we conclude the NAMA Bill this week we will ask ourselves if anything has changed.  The Government now has a chance to show that something will change, that is, the relationship of banks with those who are relying on having a roof over their heads, something that they call their home.  As Deputy Stagg said, it is important to realise that the home which provides for looking after one's partner and one's children is totally different from other assets.  The word "home" is different from a principal private residence and has nothing to do with getting one's foot on the first rung of the property ladder.  The word "home" is about children, communities and participation in education.  That is what is at stake, and the Fianna Fail-Green Party Government is doing nothing about it.  It is saying it will go to the banks that broke this country and ask them to be kind to their mortgagees and try to behave a little better and so forth.  There is no statutory obligation in the NAMA Bill that will put any lean on the banks in regard to mortgage holders.  That opportunity is not being taken.  Even the intention of doing something beyond that will be refused tonight by all those who are pouring out compassion but in the end it is their feet and their fingers that will count in terms of how they will vote at 8.30 p.m.In regard to the scheme proposed in this motion, I want to be immensely practical about this.  Those who end up in financial difficulty will often be couples where both partners were working.  They will both have been forced into the housing market and forced to take an excessive mortgage, badly, and sometime fraudulently, assessed, driven by the banks and the developers and in many cases one or other partner will lose their job.  These are the people who are in difficulty.  They have a fictitious relationship with the concept of housing.As to what is to happen to them, people have referred to MABS and so on.  MABS is doing a useful job but it is under-resourced.  It can only deal with a small number of cases.  Are we to wait for all the children to be out on the side of the road before we act?  We could take measures such as creating the capacity for a person to move from having a mortgage to having a lease and being a tenant.  In the NAMA legislation there is no dividend that the Green Party spoke about, for example, that local authorities could take some of the land on which houses have been built or even the vacant houses and use them to reduce the housing list or to deal with people who may be coming on to the housing list.  The same people who we are dealing with in the NAMA legislation, forced mortgages on to people who did not want them.  Instead of giving people a mortgage that was two and a half and three times their income, it gave mortgages that were ten and 12 times people's incomes.  I refer to greedy developers who are not builders.  Builders are good decent people who put one brick on top of another.  It was the developers who hoarded land at exorbitant prices, fuelled on by banks, which knew that they were talking to a Government that liked that kind of thing and who would contribute to the party, who created this disaster, which involves couples now in difficulty.  The children of these couples and the partners of these couples who have been failed by the economy are not the people who should be at risk.  Tonight, at half past eight, even the intention to do something will be voted on.  In the NAMA legislation we will see where, in fact, the Government stands — with speculative bankers rather than with those whose homes are threatened.

I remember saying to a number of them, and, indeed, to members of the Fianna Fáil family, that the Government had a wonderful opportunity, either in tandem with or prior to NAMA, to show that it was a caring Government and would help families in trouble.I hear the Government Deputies hanging on to one point, that there has only been X number of repossessions in recent months.  That relates to final orders, but thousands of letters have gone out.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The threats from lending agencies have gone out right around the country to people with families who are under immense pressure.I wonder about some of the cases that have come to me.  When I was told that there were only a certain number of repossessions, I thought they could not all be in my area.  When people come and tell me they saw a letter stuck on their door telling them to hand over the keys on a given date, that may not be the final order but, by God, it puts some pressure on the family concerned to try to address that matter.On assessment of the loan applications, I always said that the local authority method was the best.  When considering shared ownerships, the one point the local authorities made was that if there was even one day in the year for which the income of the person could not be accounted, they would not give the loan.  They set an example that could have been followed by everybody else.  However, the banks were so greedy, together with the developers and with the solicitors, that they wiped that to one side.  They did not believe in that.A man came to me who had sold the family home, a small house in Meath, and bought a house near me.  When he moved, unfortunately, and sadly, his wife was diagnosed with cancer.  When he came to see me, because he had to give up work to look after his wife, he wanted to apply for mortgage interest relief, which we eventually got through for him.  I asked him how he got the loan and he answered that the amazing thing was that he had only to prove to himself that he could repay the loan because the guy at the far side of the counter would have given him twice what he wanted on the basis he would get a share of it.   That was the standard the banks set and, suddenly, they are crying into their milk saying we are telling stories that are untrue.I brought a chap to a social welfare hearing who had a letter from a lending agency stating that it was looking for €560 a week from him when the only income coming into his house was a social welfare payment of €400.  I blame the solicitors and the banks for their lack of understanding of how this mechanism should have worked.  They should look at what the local authorities did.Where stand those who have shared ownership with the local authorities?  Many of those own 75%, 60%, 50% or 40% of their house and the local authority owns the rest.  Now they are not able to pay.  Is the responsibility for such loans shared with the local authority or is it the case that the person is the tenant of the house on one side and the owner of it on the other?  Is the local authority responsible in such cases as well?  I would hope that the Minister will look at the matter and come up with a solution because there are hundreds in that position who want to know where they stand.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	693	When Lehman Brothers went to the wall and the Government decided in an emergency meeting last year — behind closed doors, of course, which is where the banks always did their business — to bail out the banks to the tune of €11.5 billion, for which people in this country had worked hard and for which we are now borrowing, we thought that the world had changed.  As we quickly found out, however, the old order is still intact.The old order is the little golden circle that always existed in this country, and still exists.  The banks gave the developers the money to buy fields and build houses.  The developers then put the houses on the market and the banks gave the people the money to buy the houses.  The house prices were vastly inflated because the banks did not care.  If the developer did not sell the houses, the banks did not get repaid and, therefore, the banks had to give to the people as well.  It went around and around, repeatedly, in such a circle until there were people paying twice, sometimes three times, what the house was worth.  We are in a position where the same banks who caused this bubble have collapsed and the same taxpayers, who have been fleeced in buying the houses, now must bail out the banks.  Those very banks are threatening to put those people out of their homes, for which they paid too much in the first place and for which they cannot now pay.  That is incredible.  It is incredible that there are not mobs at the gates of this place to tear down the old order.  They will, eventually, tear down the old order because they will eventually realise the awful injustice that has been done to them.I would ask people to think seriously about those who have lost their jobs and have mortgages of anything up to €1,600 a month to whom the Department of Social and Family Affairs states they must renegotiate the loan.  I hear all the backbenchers in here tonight, from the Green Party to Fianna Fáil, speak of sympathy.  They can have all the sympathy they like.  What these people need is help, and they need it immediately.  The type of resolution that the Labour Party has put forward is the kind of help and security they need.  Come this Christmas they will be worried, not just about putting food on the table but about keeping the roof over their heads.I ask Deputies to close their eyes and imagine themselves, with two small children, unable to find that €1,600 this time next month.  You may decide that all you will pay is the interest and that you will extend the loan to 35 years.  You spread it out to 35 years and now you are paying interest only, which amounts to €1,100 a month.  Now the bank has decided to move in on you.  The same bank that has caused this to happen is now being subsidised by the State, again, through mortgage interest relief.  Here, again, with mortgage interest relief, is another way of transferring the taxpayers' money back into the banks.  Most of these people will be almost 65 by the time these mortgages are paid.  Have we thought about the consequences of that?  They will probably have retired and still be paying a mortgage.Say you lose your home and you must go into private rented accommodation, from whom do you rent a house?

Does the Government not see the awful circle?  Does it not realise that it must do something about this, and that it is a changed world and people are prepared to accept that there must be a new order?  It is said the Irish people give more per capita in times of famine abroad because we have an inherited memory of famine.  Equally, we have an inherited memory of dispossession and eviction and we do not want it reinforced by allowing to happen the awful catastrophe which is so clear and coming down the road towards us.  The Government has the opportunity to stop this happening and, for once, to break out of the awful cycle that has run this country into the ground.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The Minister for Finance may share some of my time.  On behalf of the Government, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.The provisions contained in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears still seem to be confusing to some Deputies nine months after the statutory code was introduced.  The code requires a lender to wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession.  In the case of AIB and Bank of Ireland, which have been recapitalised by the State, the moratorium period has been extended to 12 months for the duration of the subscription agreement.  This means that if a homeowner falls into arrears on 1 November 2009, the lender must wait at least six months from that date, or 12 months in the case of AIB and Bank of Ireland, before commencing enforcement of legal action.  The suggestions made by Deputies that the moratorium will run out in February 2010 are wide of the mark.  I stress that the code gives borrowers important legal rights, and the borrowers should not hold back from getting in touch with their lenders if they get into difficulty.Deputies were informed in the House yesterday that the proposal to extend the moratorium to 24 months has real potential to cause serious funding problems for Irish banks and, ultimately, for the State itself.  International credit markets are a source of funding for the Irish banks and these markets are fully aware of the exposure of Irish banks to the residential mortgage market.  It is very important not to give the message to funding markets that it is somehow acceptable to default on a mortgage in Ireland.  It is also important to state that the Minister has been reassured by the guaranteed banks that they are not intending a campaign of repossessions against homeowners who are in arrears.I will share the remainder of my time with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.

A clear flaw in this proposal is the over-detailed regulation of normal business activity by lenders.

I do not dispute this figure.  However, it is not clear how many, if any, of these repossession orders apply to owner occupiers.  It is abundantly clear from media reports, however, that most repossessions involve sub-prime lending, which by its nature is much more risky than ordinary mortgage lending.  Repossession orders affect tenanted properties as well.

This is not an issue of scaremongering.  The Minister for Finance in his very minimal contribution to this debate should not have introduced that note to what was otherwise a very reasoned discussion on all sides of the House.  He should have been present to hear Members from his own side acknowledge that this is a very real problem and that they are encountering it in their constituency clinics, just as the rest of us are.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	717	This is a very reasonable motion put forward by the Labour Party.  The Government is missing an opportunity, first, to accept a reasonable proposal that is put from the Opposition benches, and, second, to deal with a problem that will have to be dealt with eventually.There is a fundamental contradiction in the Government's response to the motion.  On the one hand, it says there were only 20 repossessions this year, or 90 including sub-prime lending, and that, therefore, there is not really a problem of repossession.  On the other hand, it says that if the Labour Party motion is passed, it will have a disastrous consequence for the country's financial position.  Speaking during the debate yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated, "The proposal for a lengthy moratorium is highly dangerous in terms of financial market perceptions and the effect they might have on the funding of the banks on which the whole economy ultimately depends."  If the problem is so small, how could it have such an enormous effect?The answer to that is also contained in the Minister of State's contribution, where he acknowledges, "The number of home owners in arrears for 90 days or more with institutions covered by the State guarantee is currently of the order 15,000-16,000."  That is just with the institutions covered by the State guarantee, without talking about people who are in the sub-prime situation.  Second, he also acknowledges there are currently some 14,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of more than 200% on those receiving the payment at the end of 2007.  Clearly, even on the Government's own admission, there is a problem which is real and will have to be addressed.The Government will come to the House and tell us that dealing with the banking situation and the State of the public finances is urgent and cannot be postponed.  However, the only comfort it will offer to the unfortunate householders faced with mortgage arrears as a result of having lost their jobs, or their businesses being in trouble, or because of the recession which was caused by Fianna Fáil, is to say that, on the one hand, those people can deal with the banks under the code of practice and, on the other hand, that there is the revised programme for Government.  Frankly, one of those is worth as little as the other.We suggest that the problem of repossession and the problem of risk to people's homes is something that should be dealt with sooner rather than later.  Early intervention is better because it will cost less.  Inevitably, if somebody's home is repossessed, the State will have to bear the financial consequence at the end of the line, either through the provision of social housing or through the provision of rent allowance, the RAS or some other intervention.  It will cost and, in the meantime, it will cost not just financially but in human and emotional terms because of the grief that people have to go through due to going through the repossession process.  It is better in everybody's interest to deal with this early, which is what the Labour Party motion calls for — early intervention.The second reason our motion should be accepted is that it removes the element of fear.  The big problem for people, even if they have not got the letter or heard the knock on the door to tell them they will be brought to court, is that they fear the possibility that they may lose their homes.  That is one of the factors that is contributing to the decline in consumer confidence, which in turn is reflected in revenues, in unemployment and in the difficulty we are having in recovering like other European countries.The third reason the Government should accept this motion is that it will give it something real with which to secure agreement on the other measures that are required to turn around the country's finances and economy.  I suggested to the Taoiseach yesterday that the Government should seek to negotiate an agreement for national recovery which would contain a number of elements, one of which would be a guarantee to people that whatever happens during this recession, provided their situation has arisen from the economic circumstances, they will not lose their homes.  If that were put on the table, I believe it would be possible to secure agreement on a whole range of other things with those currently engaged in talks with the Government.The Government is missing an opportunity to ease the fear among people who are afraid of losing their homes and to ease the real pain they are suffering at the moment.  It is also missing an opportunity to carry out an early intervention which will cost less in the long run, and it is giving up something with which it can secure agreement on the other measures that will be required to turn around the public finances.  Unfortunately, by voting down this motion tonight, the Government is spurning that opportunity.  It is regrettable that it is doing so, and it is very short sighted in taking that approach.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I would like to begin by thanking all those who contributed to this debate in the past two nights. However, it is regrettable that the Government should seek to reject this motion and replace it with what is fundamentally a deeply flawed amendment.  It is an amendment that buries its head in the sand and repeats once again that the banking fundamentals are sound, when all statistical information clearly demonstrates that there is a crisis in the mortgage sector and that this is an issue of real systemic importance.The Government amendment notes that the legal repossession of homes reported by institutions covered by the guarantee scheme amounted to 20 for the first nine months of this year.  However, this number has almost doubled this week and, more importantly, legal repossessions are ultimately the final order and cannot be judged to be a true measure of the number of mortgages in difficulty and coming before the courts.  Everybody knows that the main banks put a halt to proceedings on repossession cases until NAMA becomes fully operational.  It is also public knowledge that there are hundreds of cases pending and that hundreds of cases will commence in the new year.  The letters are written and are ready for posting.The Government's amendment also notes that the number of homeowners in arrears for 90 days with institutions covered by the State guarantee is currently between 15,000 and 16,000 and claims that the rate of increases in arrears has moderated in the early months of this year.  The figure of 15,000 may be the figure in respect of the institutions covered by the State guarantee, but this does not take into account the number of sub-prime lenders and other players in the market.  These borrowers need and deserve to have their plight taken into account and their numbers are potentially far greater than those potential defaulting borrowers with the State guaranteed institutions.The Government's amendment makes note of the introduction of a statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  In theory, this all sounds fine.  Deputy White mentioned this evening that 100% mortgages are still being issued.  Has any bank or building society been censured for failing to comply with these terms?  There is no explanation as to how this code in its operation is policed, nor is there an explanation of the consequences for non-compliance.  In effect, it is a code of conduct that lacks any teeth.Much mention has been also made of the renewed programme for Government which "envisages" expanding mortgage support measures.  The time for envisaging has long since passed.  What is required by people in fear of losing the roof over their heads is action and a fair playing pitch in the existing emergency.  People are suffering and that suffering is real and present and undermines the family life of tens of thousands of households.  Promises for the future are of little use at the moment.  Ultimately, programmes for Government, whether old or new, are akin to something stored in the attic — occasionally encountered, seen to be useful and forgotten about shortly afterwards.  Programmes for Government for this Government are just passing moments of thought.According to the ESRI, the estimated number of mortgage loans in negative equity by the end of 2009 will be almost 120,000. The full scope of the ESRI's estimation suggest that by the end of 2009, depending on the individual house price, there could be anything between 116,000 and 188,000 mortgages in negative equity.  So much for the fundamentals being sound.In reply to a parliamentary question I asked the Minister for Social and Family Affairs early this week about mortgage interest supplement applications, the figures show that for the months of August and September there were 1,123 and 1,245 claims registered, respectively.  Much has been made on the Government side of the mortgage interest relief scheme.  As mentioned last night, there are more than 14,000 people who have received the mortgage  interest supplement this year, which is an increase of 200% since 2007.  While the mortgage interest relief programme provides some relief for households, it is not a solution in itself and falls far short of what is required.  What is required is outlined in our motion.The Labour Party's motion before the House tonight is an opportunity to address that hardship in a real and measurable way.  It is an opportunity to demonstrate clearly to hard-pressed mortgage payers that this House, by means of legislation, is committed to achieving equity and fairness for home owners.  At the core of the Government's resistance to accepting our motion is an issue of perception.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, spoke last evening, he said there is already a perception of risk in connection with the Irish banks' mortgage loan books that is higher than justified.  He went on to say that it was therefore essential that nothing be done to raise further fears about the quality of mortgage loan books.  Whatever one might think about Ireland at the moment, this was like a comment in a Dickens novel that the lady's demeanour might be disposed to something.  The idea that the Irish banking reputation might be affected by extending a mortgage moratorium for two years is a nonsense.

That is a busted flush.  There is no basis to the contention suggested last night that the 24 month accommodation will create any risk of unfavourable perceptions in the markets about Irish banking lending.Ultimately, the Government amendment is about being more concerned about its friends in the banks than the plight of distressed borrowers.  The Labour Party has been accused by the Government of talking up the problem.  The Government is in denial of the reality for 35,000 households which are currently in mortgage arrears and is in fact trying to talk down the problem.  The Government mantra tonight is the same as on the night of the bank guarantee —  the fundamentals are sound, let us not worry about it, all the measures are in place.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	726	In April 2006, I recall the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, coming on the six o'clock news and telling people to go out and buy their houses because their value would keep rising.  The Government and its supporters were talking up the property market back then.It may have been beyond reasonable expectation to have expected this Government to accept what the Labour Party is proposing this evening.  However, the minimum we expected was that the Government would recognise the extent of the problem and come forward with real and meaningful measures.  That has not happened.  The Labour Party will reject the Government's amendment this evening.  This complex problem requires many significant measures to be carried out and based within a legislative framework.  The Labour Party's motion, which calls for a two-year moratorium on family home repossessions and the provision of a national home mortgage service to assist mortgage holders who are in difficulty, is the first stage of its approach to put in place structures and processes that will establish security of tenure in the residential property market for distressed home owners.  Having listened carefully to contributions from both sides of the House during this debate, I have reached the conclusion that a viable and robust mortgage modification programme can be delivered only by means of a statutory legislative code, one that requires the need for a national home mortgage service.I commend this motion to the House.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	727	The way the Minister has described the use of the special purpose vehicles, SPVs, which came like a rabbit out of a hat in terms of the legislation, has taken many people aback.  It is clear from his description that they were not mentioned in the legislation because a view from EUROSTAT was required to indicate whether that option would be accepted as an off-balance sheet vehicle.  I can understand why the Minister did not include that reference in the legislation until he got the approval, as he would have had to amend the Bill if EUROSTAT did not give the measure the go-ahead.That highlights one of the significant issues about the Bill, namely, the murky nature of special purpose vehicles in terms of clarity.  I know it is not intended to be a murky thing but in terms of trying to understand its impact on the legislation it becomes a little confusing.  That highlights the extent to which people will perceive an element of trickery in what we are doing, namely, trying to bury a large amount of borrowing on the back of a State guarantee in a manner which for accountancy reasons will be treated in a different way.  We all know that it is State borrowing one way or the other but for accountancy reasons some excuse has been made.The working of the special purpose vehicle is the most remarkable aspect of it because it will be a majority privately owned legal entity with €51 million invested by private entities.  The most peculiar aspect of it is that those private entities, in investing their money, will accept to remain silent or to do what the Government would wish in terms of their involvement with the special purpose vehicle so that NAMA would have a veto.  That makes one wonder about the kinds of people who would invest money in the special purpose vehicle.  The Minister said in the course of the debate that he might expect pension funds to invest money in the special purpose vehicle.  One can understand that he would probably like pension funds to invest their money in this special purpose vehicle, because to date pension funds have not done much in terms of asking any difficult questions, especially when they were looking after people's investments, investing much of our savings in banks and never asking questions about how those banks were run.  I have no doubt they would be nice and silent in terms of their involvement in this special purpose vehicle, if required, but it poses a difficulty in that pension fund managers can change.The ownership of a pension fund management company can change over a period.  The extent to which many big financial companies are sold, merged or get taken over by an international body is significant.  We are living in a time when there is an enormous amount of upheaval in financial circles.  We do not know what the future will entail in terms of ownership of any particular financial entity or any fund management organisation.  If it transpires that fund management organisations are ideally suited to be the private sector investor in the special purpose vehicle, as the Minister indicated he would welcome, they have an obligation in terms of the management of their funds to the people who have invested those funds.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that one day someone will make those pension fund managers sit up and take notice, ask questions and do more in terms of living up to their responsibilities about where those funds are invested.It is conceivable that we might start off this process with the likes of Irish Life, which might be a welcome investor for the special purpose vehicle.  Over a period, however, it might be taken over by somebody we do not know, and a person who is an investor or who has his or her funds invested through Irish Life might be very uncertain and unhappy about the performance of those funds, begin to ask questions, put the company under pressure and in doing so change the policy whereby it remains a dummy or quiet regarding its involvement in any investment decision relating to shareholdings for which it is responsible.  It is possible that over a period the investors whom the Minister thinks will be well behaved in the beginning will, by 2010, have changed significantly in terms of their ethics, culture or rates of return.As a result, one does not know about conflicts of interest.  There will be an enormous amount of information involved in the special purpose vehicle and in any involvement with it.  NAMA will be the biggest property management company on earth.  To the extent that it is in possession of assets of such potential value, there will be many people who would like to have an insight into the information there.  Over a period it is conceivable that the people involved in the silent part of the investment element of this special purpose vehicle might change the nature of what they do and why they are there.  For that reason, it is important to provide in the legislation for regulations and rules relating to membership and operation for the people who would be on the board of the special purpose vehicle.This special purpose vehicle is being given an enormous gift.  It will be, as legally described and as accepted by EUROSTAT, an entity that is majority privately owned.  It will issue bonds which will have a Government-backed guarantee.  The entity is not paying a penny for that guarantee.  It is a special purpose vehicle which will, the legislation states, aim to make a profit.  It will do so on the back of a Government guarantee which, under any other circumstances, a government would sell or cause the users of that guarantee to pay a fee.  I can understand why the Minister has the structure in such a way that it will operate as he has described, but the public will see it as the use of a huge public good, that is, the enormously valuable public's guarantee, for absolutely no charge.  It will be used to build profits for a special purpose vehicle, a legal entity which is designed to maximise those profits and get a return.  The public will become very unsure with regard to how that works, and who is making the profits and why, on the basis of an enormous gift.  The public will feel it is unfair to be taken for granted like that.To allay the public's fears it is important to make provision in the legislation for some form of protection.  This would say, in effect, that we understand there could be concerns about the operation of an entity such as this and, to allay those concerns, we have provided in the legislation for rules, regulations and determinations about who, how and when an individual might qualify as a suitable person to be on the board of the special purpose vehicle.  The public deserves that reassurance.  It has been let down enormously by the Government and regulation in terms of the losses it has suffered in its investments, the collapse in the banking system and the consequences of that collapse.  It deserves reassurance in the current uncertainty.Nobody has a definite template for how to get out of our current situation; there is no guarantee that the NAMA rescue plan will work.  The Minister knows that as well as Members on this side of the House.  There are huge risks, huge uncertainties and huge concerns.  In that environment, the public deserves some form of reassurance that, to the extent possible, rules and regulations will be provided for the operation of this vehicle, given that it is perceived to be such a small part of the NAMA operation.  However, it is the little things that can trip one up, as has been said so often in politics and elsewhere.  It is reasonable, therefore, to make the case for this amendment.The other striking issue about this proposal so far, and it again drives home the need to give the public as much reassurance as possible, is the fact that I know, as the Minister and anybody who knows anything about banking knows, that when banks collapse or there is a collapse in the banking system there is an enormous cost and, in most cases, a degree of that cost falls on taxpayers.  However, nowhere in what has happened so far has there been an open acceptance that this is what the Government is doing.  It produced a blueprint in the form of a draft business plan for NAMA and how it will operate.  The figures that are produced suggest it will make a profit.  It is possible that the Government feels it must present it as such because it is so difficult to tell people the truth, that NAMA will make a very significant loss.  It is not because the Government wants it to make a loss but because it appears to be the law of the economic jungle that when banking systems collapse, there are big losses and when it falls on the taxpayer to bail them out, it is the taxpayer who suffers many of those losses.  I do not believe there is any economic literature anywhere in the world which will tell one anything different.Given that truth, it is extraordinarily odd that the Government would produce a blueprint which suggests that a profit could be made.  Nobody who has looked at those numbers and who has any insight into accountancy, banking or economics thinks that the figures in the draft business plan will add up.  The plan is presented as if it will not be a loss to the taxpayer but the reality is that the assumptions, particularly the one about recovering 80% of the bad loans over a time, are fanciful.

#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	729	Perhaps if the Minister waits until Godot comes, it might happen.  If all of the fanciful assumptions in the plan worked out, it is conceivable that NAMA would one day, when we are all most likely in the grave, make a profit or clear itself.  Essentially, however, throughout the world collapsing banking systems cause taxpayers to foot a significant bill.  It strikes me, therefore, that there is a huge element of cover-up with regard to the NAMA process, the blueprint, the way it is operating and how it has been presented, because it is very difficult to tell people that, particularly in the current environment.The public deserves better.  The Minister must come clean and explain to the public that it is fanciful to suggest we will get a profit out of this, that we would love to get a profit but there are huge risks and that very brave assumptions have been made but they might not work out.  The Green Party was quite reasonable in its comments on this.  Senator Dan Boyle said he considered it unrealistically optimistic, and he is absolutely right.  The public needs to be treated better; it needs the Minister to be more up-front.  In that spirit, it is important that the Minister do what he can in the legislation to give people reassurance.  NAMA will most likely make a loss or at least there will be significant fears that it will make a loss, and people will feel they have been mugged.  They already quite rightly feel they have been mugged.  We have all been mugged.  However, in terms of the legislation and what the Minister is putting together in the plan, the public deserves protection.Many elements of this special purpose vehicle are disturbing.  One wonders if the 51% shareholder will be an individual or a pension fund.  It could easily be an individual.  Who are those individuals, what are their qualifications and what is their bona fides in terms of what they are trying to do?  Are they getting a big maximum return for them?  Undoubtedly, the Minister does not expect it to be an individual.  It would make more sense for it to be a fund.  It could be an individual and I know the Minister would not rule out that, but he did refer to pension funds in the debate.  It is conceivable that over a period a time the 51% could be held by somebody else.  Consequently, it is essential that we provide for as much protection as possible.This amendment seeks rules about the suitability of those investors and the suitability and behaviour of the members of the board.  The public deserves to have that in the legislation.  The amendment refers to finance planning, accountability and reporting for the SPV.  That is absolutely essential.  If, as the Minister has argued, this is a small part of the overall NAMA process, it should not be a big deal to give such reassurances in the legislation.  It is beyond question that we have an obligation to the public, given that there is so much secrecy about the operation of this NAMA legislation.  There are so many things that will not be discoverable and so many elements where there is potential for conflict of interest in terms of who knows what and how they might operate, it is indefensible not to be support this amendment.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	730	There are major flaws in the Bill which those of us on this side of the House are attempting to correct.  One such flaw relates to the lack of transparency and accountability required to provide reassurance to taxpayers.  What is happening is shocking and completely disrespectful, particularly when one considers that €54 billion of taxpayers' money is at stake and needs to be protected.  The Minister has refused to legislate in respect of a Dáil committee to oversee NAMA.  He has also failed to make provision in the Bill with regard to the freedom of information legislation.  Furthermore, he has not included a separate section to deal specifically with how the master SPV and the baby SPVs will function and what will be their function.There is a lack of information at present.  It is critical that we should be informed as to who will be the investors and how the master SPV will operate.  We have been told that the master SPV, not NAMA, will purchase, manage and dispose of the assets.  As Deputy Lee stated, this information came as a bolt from the blue.  The Minister has really pulled a rabbit from the hat.  It is regrettable that we were not provided with this information at an earlier date.Amendment No. 3 seeks to control and regulate the master SPV and the baby SPVs and to ensure that the taxpayer is protected.  In that context, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	731	Deputy Lee, in a very interesting contribution, referred to the business plan.  The latter is a draft interim plan and it was not concocted for a political purpose.  On Second Stage, Deputy Burton inquired as to the whereabouts of the business plan and other Opposition Deputies were complaining that enough information was not being provided.  In such circumstances, I asked the interim chief executive of NAMA and his staff to prepare an interim plan.  They did so but I gave them no riding instructions in respect of it.  When I introduced the legislation I made it clear that I would be quite satisfied if NAMA broke even.  My instructions to my officials and to those working at the NTMA was that regardless of the way matters are designed, they must ensure that we break even in respect of NAMA.I accept the plan is subject to the assumptions made in it.  We can argue about those assumptions but the interim plan was prepared in good faith.  There will be an onus on the board of NAMA, when appointed, to draw up a formal business plan.  That is the key point.  The relevant Dáil committee will be able to examine that plan and continue this debate.  It would be more constructive if the debate were to continue in that context because the board, which will be charged with fiduciary obligations on the part of its directors, will be obliged to stand over the plan.I wish to deal with a number of extraneous matters before commenting on the amendment.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the Fitch credit rating agency.  He is correct in stating that this agency assessed our position on an Exchequer and on a Stability and Growth Pact basis.  The latter is the basis upon which assessments will be made.  It is better for the country that there is a Stability and Growth Pact basis which is separate from the Exchequer basis.  The statement relating to the downgrading by Fitch makes for interesting reading.  Although it is a downgrading of two notches to AA-, Fitch notes that the long-term outlook is stable and states:Fitch has downgraded Ireland's sovereign ratings to reflect the severity of the decline in nominal GDP and the exceptional rise in government liabilities... However, the agency notes the vigour of the government's fiscal consolidation response to date, the expectation of further aggressive budget tightening and the likely success of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in rehabilitating the banking sector.  All these factors have helped stabilise the outlook for Ireland's creditworthiness.Fitch also makes the point that NAMA is "likely to be successful in stabilising and rehabilitating the banking sector, providing both solvency and liquidity support and mitigating pressures on the supply of new credit to industry and households".It was important to read that part of the Fitch statement into the record because the Deputy referred to the assessment in a particular context.  However, the general context of the assessment is extremely positive with regard to this proposal.  The contributions on this subject and in respect of this part of the Bill have been very positive as well.  It is only natural that we all become lost in our rhetorical flights.  However, the core of what was suggested and advocated was sensible.  However, I regret to advise Members that this does not mean I am going to accept the amendment.

I have a great deal of sympathy with the points put forward by Deputy Burton.  In general, when there is an asset purchase arrangement in place when one is engaging in a commercial operation through borrowing — for example, when one capitalises a semi-State body — in Stability and Growth Pact terms, the transaction occurs off balance sheet.  Even the capitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank is an off-balance sheet transaction in Stability and Growth Pact terms because that institution is a commercial entity.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I will not be drawn on this subject.  Apart from maintaining a particular commercial entity, it is essential for the stability of our financial system.The position in respect of bank rescue operations is that there is a specific prohibition, under EUROSTAT, on treating such a vehicle as other than borrowing for Stability and Growth Pact purposes.  Rather than repeal this provision in light of the current banking crisis — I understand some member states made demands in this regard — it has been decided to devise methods to ensure that avoidance can be achieved in a different way.  Essentially, that is what has happened in Europe in respect of this matter.  I understand the frustration of some Deputies with regard to the apparently peculiar character of the transactions which that generates.  However, that is where Ireland, as a country, stands.The implications of being in the Stability and Growth Pact for the purposes of this investment are quite serious.  They do not just relate to the actual picture as regards the national debt, they also relate to the fact that as payments are made in a different direction, they count as being in and out of the national balance sheet.  That would make the computation of the national accounts exceptionally complex.In any event, I cannot accept the amendment because it could result in EUROSTAT changing its preliminary decision on the treatment of NAMA's operations and the national accounts.  I have repeatedly explained that we should welcome EUROSTAT's preliminary decision — which most Deputies have done — because, as a result of it, the acquisition of assets from the financial institutions will have no effect on either the general Government debt ratio or the general Government balance.  That places the asset protection scheme on an equivalent footing with bank support schemes in other member states, which are also being recorded off balance sheet.  The main advantage of this is that it minimises the danger of the markets or international investors misinterpreting our headline debt or budget balance ratios when comparing Ireland against other EU states.I accept that this statistical treatment does not change the basic fact, which Opposition Deputies naturally highlighted, that the operations of NAMA will lead to an increase in the amount of the State's potential liabilities.  However, it should not be overlooked that these liabilities will be matched by countervailing asset holdings.It is intended that the master special purpose vehicle will be established by the board of NAMA to conduct the purchase, management and disposal of loan assets which have been identified and valued by NAMA.  The legislation provides a robust process for the appointment of members of the board of NAMA, requiring that they should possess senior level experience and expertise in relevant areas.  These are complex commercial tasks and there is a danger in imposing statutory regulations and restrictive rules in respect of them.A detailed legal shareholder agreement is being drawn up and will be put in place to ensure that, at all times, the NAMA board will have a veto over all the master SPV's actions and decisions.  This will protect the NAMA board, which will have significant responsibilities, and it is also in the interests of all citizens and taxpayers.  I intend to issue a direction to the board of NAMA to the effect that not a single decision that would not be in the best interests or in line with achieving the objectives and purposes of the NAMA legislation should be made or should be allowed to be pursued by the master SPV.  I undertook on Committee Stage to have the NAMA SPV and group entities issues addressed in more detail in the legislation and to refer the matter to the Attorney General.  The issues have been examined.  I propose to introduce a number of amendments explicitly applying provisions of the Bill to the NAMA group entities.  While these amendments can be dealt with later in the debate, I will outline them now.First, the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001 provisions that apply to the NAMA board and staff will be extended to all directors on the boards of NAMA group entities.  Second, the duties relating to NAMA board members will also extend to the boards of the NAMA group entities.  In addition, I am bringing forward an amendment to require NAMA and all NAMA group entities to have a register of interests for board members and senior staff.  I acknowledge it was Deputy Mulcahy who suggested this and Deputy Burton who suggested the earlier ones.  Third, the detailed reporting requirements in Part 3 will also apply to the activities of NAMA group entities and the powers and rights that NAMA has in its dealings with participating institutions will attach to NAMA group entities.There has been an amount of revision of the Bill in respect of this subject.  The Attorney General is satisfied that the core power exists.  There has been a detailed section by section analysis of this matter which I believe addresses many of the concerns raised by the Opposition.  I cannot go the final distance that Deputies Bruton, Burton and Rabbitte want me to go because I must keep within the boundaries of the EUROSTAT advice.  Clearly, that is an important issue.  Again, the Dáil committee can evaluate and scrutinise what is put in place, including the shareholder agreement.The heads of the shareholder agreement can be submitted to the committee.  However, I cannot give an undertaking on every provision of the shareholder agreement for obvious reasons.

Financial functions can only take place within the SPV, the master vehicle.  The subordinates, if established, are purely for management and not financial purposes.  The quantum of the investment is so low it would become pointless at that level to delegate the investment into parcels or particular vehicles.

Will it prevent unsuitable people becoming members of this board?  I am speaking in this regard about people who are unsuitable in the broadest sense, unsuitable for this job, not necessarily unsuitable in terms of conflicts of interest or corruption, but because they are not appropriate people to be investors in an asset recovery system which is dealing with property developers and financial institutions with many cross obligations.  Where in the shareholder agreement is the reassurance that these people will be suitable?The Minister has stated that it is absolutely crucial that the SPVs are autonomous in their decision-making but he has not explained how he squares their autonomy with the power of veto in the hands of NAMA and his powers of direction.  If they are autonomous, from whom are they autonomous if not from NAMA, Ministers and others?  How does the Minister square this with his claims that they are autonomous?The Minister did not respond to the point made earlier by Deputy Barrett that not only will SPVs make decisions, but they will be directly responsible and accountable at law.  If that is the case and they are, as a company of €51 million private and €100 million in all, managing a €54 billion portfolio, what does the Minister mean when he says they are accountable at law?  Can they be sued in respect of decisions that having a bearing on a portfolio that is entirely different from the one they have put in?  Can the Minister explain the purpose of the €100 million put into this vehicle?  From where did that come?  Why not have a special purpose vehicle with €1 in it?  This would ensure there is no issue in terms of potential returns.In short, the Minister has not adequately explained why we cannot go some of the way towards these amendments to at least control the suitability of investors, have published returns that can be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and have a methodology for determining the dividend that we in this House can see.  Surely, some of these matters can be presented to us rather than leaving them to an act of faith in NAMA and the Minister with the directives he issues.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I have a couple of questions for the Minister arising out of his contribution.  I agree that accepting the amendment in toto could result in the EUROSTAT changing its mind in regard to particular items.  I recall reading that the reason EUROSTAT accepted the argument put forward by the Central Statistics Office on this matter was that under the methodology it uses, there would be private investors who believe that there is a potential for substantial profit in being part of an SPV.The reason for using the SPV is to get, as the Minister said, the loan book off the Exchequer balance sheet.  We are speaking about a significant amount of money.  It is approximately 30% of GDP.  If an international investor is monitoring the situation, it looks better on paper if the national debt is at 70% of GDP rather than 100% of GDP.  Obviously, serious investors know the difference.  This has happened in France and Germany and it provides a better perception of the national balance sheet.I agree with much of the content of the amendment, including the provisions relating to the suitability of investors.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say that this issue comes under the prevention of corruption provisions and that the declaration of interests will be put in place for each of the directors.  I am interested to know what issues within paragraphs (a) to (f) the Minister believes would affect EUROSTAT’s decision on the matter.  It would be interesting for us all to hear the Minister’s response in this regard.At the end of the day, it is important that the principles behind the SPV are set out.  I accept what the Minister said, namely, that it will probably be some form of insurance company or people in the market for bonds and pension purposes in the future and who have a stake in the Irish economy who will invest in this vehicle.  Is the 10% bonus at the end of the ten years written in stone or can it be adjusted in order to attract investors into special purpose vehicles, SPVs?  Has a deal already been done with investors in principle and is there an agreement that they will be prepared to go into this particular type of vehicle based on the current situation and that it is likely to continue into the immediate future?  What is the up-to-date position with regard to the coming to fruition of the particular type of vehicle or way of doing things in place currently?The people involved in this must be above reproach and what the Minister has stated to date suggests this will be the case.  He has also said the committee will also be able to examine the code that will be adopted.  This must not only be above reproach in form, but also in fact.  It is vital that there is no fall-out from the SPV or from the principles or people behind it that could in any way embarrass not only us, but the economy of the country in such a way that our financial credibility could be endangered.

That is a positive step.In section 4, the definition of a NAMA group entity on page 20 is "a subsidiary of NAMA" and so on, and reference is made to "any other body corporate and any trust, partnership," etc.  The Labour Party has put forward an amendment in section 17 to extend that definition to include the SPV, in the context of it having a minority or majority share in a vehicle.  In addition to the concessions the Minister has made, it is necessary to recognise the kind of vehicle this is because it is not majority owned.  The Minister may be clear in his mind that this vehicle cannot have further subsidiaries or associates — I do not want to go into the tax issue but if people were clever enough they could put these offshore — but we need a lot more specific, technical prevention measures introduced.  Will the Minister check this out with the Attorney General?  Will he agree to do that?

I ask the Minister to return to the issue of the shareholders' agreement.  He said the board is not up and running so we cannot talk about what is in the shareholders' agreement.  What kind of things has the Minister in mind that will mean the minority shareholder will dictate the play?  I have some difficulty with that.  I can understand how NAMA will be able to veto certain things it thinks are not consistent with the purpose of this legislation or certain actions the banks want to take.  However, how does it deal with issues in terms of things NAMA might want to do?  NAMA can stop things from happening, but can it cause things to happen?  I am not sure I understand how this is permissible under the construct the Minister is going for.Like Deputy Ardagh, I wonder about the Minister's response to the Fine Gael amendment.  If the Minister were to take on board this amendment, what elements of it would put it at risk from a EUROSTAT review?  I cannot see how to prescribe that the investors ought to be suitable or that the people directing the operation ought to be appropriate or the requirement to deal with how the special purpose vehicle will discharge its functions could put the amendment outside the line.  Part of the problem here is that the Minister has very congenially ——

The Minister has left us hanging in that he has assured us that he has just had a message from the Attorney General, who has advised him he may indeed accede to those difficult questions being posed from the opposite side of the House.  However, we do not know when and how he will accede.  The Bill will be gone from this House again before the Minister addresses the issue.  He has some amendments here, but he has also promised us amendments that will materialise later.  That will not arise until the Bill goes before the other House.  I would like to see them before we finish with the Bill in this House.

Special purpose vehicles are quite commonplace in the private sector.  The Minister is setting up this SPV in order, technically, to remove the €54 billion from the balance sheet.  However, credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings, factored in the €54 billion that NAMA is taking on board.

For it to be off the balance sheet, it must satisfy a number of requirements, namely that it is a separate legal entity with autonomy of decision in day to day operations, be able to incur its liabilities on its behalf and have complete accounting information.  In a normal case in the private sector, anyone investing in an SPV will sit down, and even if they hold only 49% of the shares, with someone else holding 51%, he or she will still look at the suitability of investors.  I expect anyone who would invest 49% would question who sits on the board.  For finance, planning, accounting and reporting, there is no way someone would invest €49 million without questioning how the investment will perform, will be reported or the manner in which the SPV should discharge its functions under theAct.Effectively any SPV is set up for a particular purpose: it must carry out its functions.  The method and determination of the appropriateness of paying a dividend or bonus to investors are standard in terms of the way the dividend will be paid and the measures that will be used in terms of profit.  Has the Minister or the Attorney General, while looking at the review, asked EUROSTAT its view of the amendment?  We are looking at a structure to protect the 49% interest.  I see nothing inconsistent in the amendment.  If it operates in the private sector, it should be done in the same way in the public sector.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	768	Deputy Kennedy asked if there would be a separate SPV for each financial institution.  There will not be.  Also, the €100 million is the total consideration of the entire special purpose vehicle.Deputy Bruton asked why have €100 million, why not establish a €1 company.  In Deputy Rabbitte's constituency many years ago there were developers and builders who incorporated companies for £1 and then liquidated them when foundations of houses were unsound.  A sovereign state cannot behave in that way.  The subscribed capital is likely to be €100 million, a sum accepted by EUROSTAT as appropriate.  I could not assure the House that EUROSTAT would find a €1 company to be appropriate.  Deputy Rabbitte's then Labour Party colleague made his political reputation on dealing with these people who built houses with £1 companies covering them.Of course the crucial point about subscribers is that the NAMA board will be able to decide who the subscribers should be.  It will have complete control over that area.  Fantastical pictures have been painted of hedge-fund owners and disguised banking interests moving in but the reality is that NAMA itself will have to make a commercial decision about an appropriate set of subscribers.  I doubt it would be a natural person because a company would give the clarity a private individual would not have for a subscription.Deputy Bruton also asked about the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will audit the special purpose vehicle.  That is clear from the definitions in the legislation that have been strengthened by the amendments.  It is under full control of the Comptroller and Auditor General.Deputy Ardagh asked if the deal had been done on NAMA yet for the special purpose vehicle.  That cannot be done until the board is established so there is no question of negotiations having been embarked upon or concluded because that is a matter for the board of the agency.  This all illustrates the urgency of the appointment of the board of the agency.  I want to proceed with this forthwith on the enactment of the legislation because it must attend to important responsibilities immediately.

As Deputy O'Donnell rightly said, everything depends on the terms of the shareholders' agreement but shareholders' agreements are very common.  He gave the private analogy but there are many shareholding agreements where the subscriber takes a 1% shareholding but determines the entire policy of the company.  I have seen many shareholding agreements where that has been the case.It seemed to me that much of Deputy Rabbitte's argument was based on the majority-minority zero sum game.  To use a metaphor from our political experience, the shareholding agreement is not unlike the Good Friday Agreement.  It can provide a consensual manner in which a company will be managed consistent with the legislation.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	787	Again I am disappointed in the response.  We are being asked to accept the rejection of this amendment that would give the Oireachtas some control without any sight of the shareholders' agreement.  The Minister is totally vague as to the criteria EUROSTAT applies that should inform the Oireachtas decision in the area.  He offers platitudes about what EUROSTAT might accept.Deputies Ardagh, Rabbitte and O'Donnell asked the straight question what element of amendment No. 3 in my name contravenes the EUROSTAT requirements but the Minister did not answer.  He did not even advert to the question in his response.  That suggests he is evading questions coming from all sides of the House.  The suitability of investors could not interfere with them, the behaviour of members of the board might but not their suitability.  Similarly, the finance, planning accountability and reporting could not interfere with them.  Perhaps the manner in which the special purpose vehicle shall discharge its functions could interfere with the criterion of being autonomous.  If, however, it does interfere how can the Minister say that a veto by NAMA does not interfere with their autonomy or that his ability to issue a direction that binds NAMA, and by extension the special purpose vehicle, does not interfere with it?  We are being asked to accept the Minister's word even when some of his assurances sound as if they come from Alice in Wonderland.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20688	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	789	That is what I find it difficult to accept.  We are being asked time and again to accept on faith in respect of this legislation that the Minister has many things that are too sophisticated for him to explain fully to us in the House but that if we trust him he will have everything sorted.  We would not be in the hole we are in if Ministers and advisers in the financial and regulatory system had the answers sorted.  The Minister ignores sharp questions from Deputies on both sides of the House when he sums up.  We do not have that level of confidence.Has the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Attorney General been consulted in respect of EUROSTAT and whether our amendment would interfere with its independence?  Do we have a legal opinion of our own even if we do not have a EUROSTAT opinion?  I am not convinced that we should time and again accept that on the day everything will be right, that the Minister will form an Oireachtas committee that answers all our needs, will come up with a shareholders' agreement that answers all our problems or that we can afford to suspend our disbelief and let the Minister and his officials away with it.  Unfortunately we have suspended our disbelief too often in the past and appalling consequences have come of that.I cannot accept the Minister's assurances that we do not need some level of control.  Intuition suggests that the Minister's shareholders' agreement with his veto and directive are far more likely to infringe what we know of EUROSTAT than my humble amendment, which simply provides for information to be presented and that the people on this board are suitable persons, do not have conflicts of interest, report effectively, and do not interfere with the objectives of NAMA.  This amendment is eminently acceptable.  It may need a small bit of tweaking but I think Deputy Gogarty will finally accept that it should be accepted in principle, subject to some tweaking in the Seanad to suit the Minister's requirements.

In page 16, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:"(a) to contribute to the sustainable social and economic development of the State,”.This Labour Party amendment proposes to insert the words "to contribute to the sustainable social and economic development of the State".  Members who were here for the Committee Stage debate will recall that the Minister agreed to accept the spirit of a similar amendment we tabled.  Our Committee Stage amendment No. 40 proposed that "NAMA shall undertake proper and sustainable planning for all properties under development" and so on.  I am in a slight quandary because the Minister said he would accept the spirit of amendment No. 40 and suggested that a way of doing that was to change the wording of our amendment to "sustainable social and economic development".  We have done that, as the Minister suggested.  However, he forgot his own advice because I note that his amendment proposes to insert the words "to contribute to the social and economic development of the State", which is the original Labour Party wording proposed.I do not want to delay the House, but all I need from the Minister is an indication that he accepts, as we discussed previously, that the wording to be inserted should be "sustainable social and economic development of the State" in terms of the purposes of the Bill.  If the Minister agrees to that, we can all go home a little happier.The purpose of our amendment No. 8, as we discussed on Committee Stage, is to advise that the Bill should make specific references to the laws of the European Union and the guidelines and so on in regard to state aid and any other relevant guidelines.  Given all the commentary we have heard about EUROSTAT, state aid and so on, this is a sensible amendment.  I have not heard any good argument as to why it is not appropriate.  It would probably protect the Irish position to a greater extent in the context of the references made in the previous discussion on the Bill.On amendment No. 5, it goes without saying that while the purpose of the Bill is obviously to rescue the banks, the bankers and the developers, the primary purpose of spending €53 billion should be the sustainable social and economic development of the State.  This will play out over a very long period.  It involves vast numbers of properties and land all around the country.  It is important that those who are tasked with being on the board of directors of NAMA and looking after the affairs of the agency and the special purpose vehicle should have sustainable social and economic development as a clear mandate and instruction to them from the Oireachtas.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	794	On this amendment and the Minister's dealing with the social aspects, there is an issue to which many Members of the House may have given some thought.  It has been dealt with or referred to earlier in some of the debates on the legislation but it is important to raise it here and to get a steer on how NAMA intends to approach it.What I have in mind is the vast number of unfinished housing estates some of which are partially occupied and the vast number of apartments occupied by approximately one quarter of the numbers of people who may ultimately be in a position to purchase them.  There are unfinished apartments and housing estates where planning permissions have been granted, conditions have not been properly complied with, developers have run out of money and are not in a position to complete estates, and those who have purchased and moved in find themselves in difficult circumstances.  What I want clarified is how NAMA will deal with this.Initially, the debts of the developers will be transferred to NAMA and it will remain, under the planning conditions granted, the developers' responsibility to complete estates.  Then there will be developers who lack the capacity to complete estates.  The only way they will be able to complete them is if they get additional funding through NAMA.  There will be an issue of whether they should get that additional funding or whether the properties should be subject to a vesting order which places them within NAMA.  Within Dublin city and county and in other parts of the country there are people living in unfinished estates and apartments where some of the basic facilities surrounding them have not been provided who could find themselves for years in that position.  I want the Minister to clarify briefly what NAMA's role will be in seeking to ensure estates are properly finished, planning conditions are complied with, and people are not left living in what could best be described as a wasteland in circumstances where they are trapped within properties they cannot sell with facilities that fall very short of what the planning authority originally envisaged.What sort of timeframe will there be for this issue to be dealt with?  How will NAMA deal with the matter at a time when the debts have been transferred to it and the still indebted developer is not meeting obligations prior to a vesting order being sought?  How will NAMA deal with the matter subsequent to it successfully obtaining a vesting order?  If NAMA does not deal with the original developer, what will its role be in recruiting an appropriate developer or construction company to complete unfinished estates?  What will be the economics of this?  I can well envisage circumstances where to complete estates could result in a vast amount of accommodation being completed for which there are no purchasers.  This is another additional level of problem.  To what extent has this problem been addressed?

There is NAMA for the bankers and for the speculators and I suppose what we have here is barely crumbs from the master's table for ordinary people.  It is unfortunate that we cannot strengthen this Bill in some way to deal more forcefully with the issues affecting real people.

To contribute to the sustainable social and economic development is fine, but when the Bill goes to the Seanad it would be worthwhile to consider including, in whatever form it might be, the social, economic and cultural development of the State.  I say that because I listened to reference to large tracts of land which will never be built on and which could be of significant public benefit if they were made available to make up the cultural infrastructure deficit that exists in many different places and spaces.  It would have the advantage of providing for better development overall.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	797	I thank Deputy Burton for her amendment.  This was an issue which arose on Committee Stage.  The Minister indicated that he is agreeable to the broad thrust of including this aim and objective as part of the legislation.  As the Deputy will be aware, he will introduce his own amendment to this section to deal with the issue and the proposal of Deputy Burton.  The Minister's amendment inserts the words "to contribute to the social and economic development of the State", but this, in addition to the existing powers, aims and objectives of NAMA which were set out in the legislation, will make it explicit that one of the purposes of NAMA will be to contribute to the social and economic development of the State.  Given the Minister's amendment, although slightly differently worded than Deputy Burton's amendment, he would suggest that this is the more appropriate way of dealing with it.The Deputy would ask, correctly, why the word "sustainable" is omitted at this stage.  That is not to say the Minister is not in broad agreement with what the Deputy is trying to say, but there are circumstances where it could be envisaged that developments would not be permanent in nature.  Even though they might contribute to the economic and social development of the country, they need not necessarily——

It is an important point because all of us in our own constituencies face this problem of unfinished estates.  Certainly, NAMA will have a potential role in that regard.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I wish to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the nature of the review he has sought on the matter of tiger kidnappings.  Yesterday's event is the latest in what is an appalling ordeal for families to be put through.  The sharp rise in tiger kidnappings in recent times is evidence of manifest failure in the criminal justice system.  The most recent CSO statistics show that kidnappings increased by 86% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and increased by 57% in the past 12 months.  The State is clearly regarded as a soft touch when it comes to tiger kidnappings.A delegation of senior gardaí and officials from the main banks met on 2 March this year to discuss protocols following a tiger kidnapping on 28 February that netted €7.6 million for raiders of Bank of Ireland on College Green.  Following the raid, the Minister had a much-publicised meeting with the Garda Commissioner.  Yesterday, as it has been on a number of occasions,  the Bank of Ireland was targeted again.  It is clearly considered something of a soft touch by those responsible and yesterday's raid was the fourth on a Bank of Ireland branch this year.Following last week's raid, bank staff themselves called for a major review of bank security by the Government and Garda, as well as by the Bank of Ireland.  I understand the Minister is to meet the Garda Commissioner tomorrow to discuss tiger kidnappings, a meeting which was planned before yesterday's raid.  Has a limit been agreed in respect of how much money an employee can take out or handle in a bank?  If not, the message to armed gangs is that tiger kidnappings are lucrative and rather easy to execute.I ask the Minister to consider the issue of resources with particular reference to community gardaí.  The raiders in these case have clearly put a watch on the victim's house before the kidnap.  They had monitored their houses and the movements of officials and their families.  There can be no doubt that the absence of community gardaí on the ground is helping raiders who stalk their victims in this way.  How many gardaí are assigned to the Ballycallan district of Kilkenny, for example?  At 6% of the force, there are simply not enough community gardaí working and living in communities.  The €30 million cut in Garda overtime, the cap on Garda recruitment, the downgrading of rural stations and the brain drain from the senior echelons of the Garda force caused by large-scale retirement of senior officers is all combining to make life somewhat easier for criminals.I ask in this short debate what has the Minister specifically done to address the problem of tiger kidnappings, apart from having a couple of meetings with the Garda Commissioner and bank figures?  It has recently been reported that gardaí in the crime and security section at Garda headquarters have been working on internal protocols to advise officers about dealing with tiger kidnappings for over a year, but I wonder have the guidelines yet been agreed, published and accepted.  Have gardaí been given details of the agreed protocols between banks and Garda management on tiger raids?  Some say they are investigating with one hand effectively tied behind their backs.If an employee walks into the local branch where he or she works and withdraws money because his or her family has been taken hostage, the duty manager at the branch is expected to dial a set phone number.  The number connects to the Garda sergeant on duty at Garda command and control, who then contacts crime and security section.I ask the Minister to take this matter seriously.  We cannot allow a situation where law and order in the State plummets to the depths we witnessed yesterday, last week and on a number of occasions this year.  I ask the Minister to ensure that not only are there robust and proper protocols in place, but that these protocols are complied with and adhered to by the bank personnel.  If not, then the heads of security at our banks must consider their positions.  Co-operation between the Garda and the banks under the direction of the Minister must ensure that these appalling acts are not only not tolerated, but are no longer an occurrence in our State.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	819	First, let me say that my sympathy goes out to Adrian Ronan, his wife, Mary, and to their children for the terrible ordeal they endured yesterday.  As well as sympathising with them, I want to praise the courage they showed during the incident.Tiger kidnappings are a despicable and vicious form of criminal activity which involve targeting working people and their families.  Sadly, the Ronan family are just the latest people to have been caught up in them.  While yesterday's incident was very traumatic, thankfully, no one was physically injured and no money was handed over to criminals.  In other words, the tiger kidnap completely failed in its objective.Deputies will appreciate that Garda inquiries are still ongoing so it would not be helpful for me to go into the details.  However, a major Garda operation was launched to deal with the situation once it arose.  An intensive investigation is continuing to bring the perpetrators to justice.It is a demonstration of the ruthlessness and brutality of the criminals involved that they threaten the families or ordinary working people, even young children.  I condemn them utterly and I know that the Members of this House are at one in agreeing with me in that regard.There is an implicit assertion in the Deputy's contribution that simply pouring more resources into this area would be a panacea for all our problems.  The fact is that, even in the current extremely difficult financial circumstances, the Government is devoting enormous resources to the fight against crime.  I have made it clear that it is an absolute priority in the allocation of resources within my Department.  The programme for Government commits us to continuing to maintain policing services at the highest level possible.The issue here is not primarily one of resources and it is disingenuous for anyone to imply otherwise.  The key to curbing this type of incident is to ensure to the greatest extent possible that attempts to extort money in these circumstances are unsuccessful.  To do so requires everyone involved to adhere to the protocols which have been drawn up by the Garda and the financial institutions.  Deputy Charles Flanagan said he wanted the protocols published.  I am not sure that would be the wisest course.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I do not want them published.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	821	I thought the Deputy said that.I do not underestimate the pressure which people who are the victims of tiger kidnappings find themselves under.  It is very easy for us to be critical of them in those circumstances and easy to demand that they adhere to the protocols.  Obviously, in circumstances where they are under extreme duress, they have to think of themselves and their loved ones first.  However, these protocols are there to protect them and where they have been implemented, they have worked in recent times.  The greatest advantage the criminals have is fear.  I want to assure the House and the employees of financial institutions that the Garda Síochána's absolute priority when faced with an incident of this kind is to ensure that no harm comes to the victims.Let me be clear.  It is in the interests of all, in particular the staff of the financial institutions, that they follow the protocols which have been agreed.  When we have a situation where the protocols are operated and these kidnaps are thwarted, it should help bring an end to the gangs attempting them.  When people in banks find that one of their colleagues is in this situation, of course, at a human level, they want to do everything to help.  However, the fact is that by operating the protocols they will help prevent these incidents happening and their own families or those of their colleagues being put at risk.The Deputy may be aware that I intend to meet the chief executives of the various financial institutions tomorrow, a meeting that was scheduled before Tuesday's incident.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner to attend as well.  I will also meet representatives of banking employees in the coming week.I do not doubt the commitment of the banks to the well-being of their staff, nor their desire to help foil these crimes in question.  However, I will be asking them what further measures are being put in place to ensure that only a limited amount of money is accessible to a single employee at any one time.  I will once again be emphasising that the full implementation of the security arrangements for such incidents, on each and every occasion they arise, is vital to our efforts to make such raids a thing of the past.In the face of such tactics, it is incumbent on the Government, the law enforcement agencies and the banking industry to work together to combat this threat.  I have no interest in shirking my responsibility as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in facing up to these gangs.  In addition to maintaining the high level of resources currently devoted to the fight against crime, I have enacted various Bills that will directly assist the Garda Síochána in its work in tackling such crimes.  I cannot give details publicly of the activities being undertaken by the Garda in this regard, but I can assure the House that the force is sparing no effort in tackling gangs who carry out these deplorable acts.The Garda Síochána is fully committed to combating this form of criminality as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs.  We are fortunate in having a highly professional police force with great experience of tackling organised criminal and subversive activity, and I am sure all Members will join with me in commending the efforts of the Garda Síochána in this respect.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	822	Howth sea scouts is a voluntary organisation which contributes greatly to the Howth area.  The people of Howth built a den at the west pier and it should therefore be retained for public use.  The den has been used by generations of scouts and needs to be retained for this purpose.The sea scouts use the scout hall every day and also provide activities such as camps, competitions, first aid training, canoeing, hikes, treasure trails, boat maintenance days and training courses.  At present 120 children ranging in ages from six to 20 years use these facilities.  The sea scouts provide an outlet for these young people.  It instills a maritime tradition in our youth and provides training in all aspects of seamanship.Howth is a fishing village which has seen a loss of white fishing vessels in the last number of years.  The maintenance of this tradition is imperative to the village.   The recent decision taken by the Minister of State with responsibility for the marine not to renew the lease on the land currently used by Howth sea scouts is devastating.  The sudden termination of the lease has come as a shock to all concerned and I call on the Minister of State to review his decision immediately and to grant an extension to the lease.The original lease was for 20 years, so surely the sea scouts have some rights.  The lease expired in 2007 and a two year lease was subsequently granted.  The lease was due to be renewed on 1 November but instead the sea scouts were given notice to leave the building, leaving them homeless and with nowhere to store their equipment.  The Minister of State made the decision to pass the land to the highest commercial bidder, subsequently disregarding the interests of the sea scouts and the people of Howth who helped build this community facility.  Scouting groups are unable to compete with commercial organisations.The Minister of State has suggested that the sea scouts co-use the premises occupied by Howth Sea Angling Club.  This possibility has been examined and it has proved to be unsuitable.  A purpose built ground floor is needed to store their rowing boats, dinghies, kayaks and canoes.  As a youth organisation, the sea scouts have a policy of no alcohol and a venue containing a bar such as that occupied by Howth Sea Angling club is unsuitable.The lease should be renewed as it is the right thing to do.  This premises belongs to the community.  The sea scouts have used this premises for the last 22 years.  It is needed to preserve maritime traditions, promote water safety and to provide a safe environment for our youth.  We also need to instill confidence in our young people, and the sea scouts achieves this.  We need to help our young people to learn in a positive manner, and they learn skills at the sea scouts which they retain for life.  Anti-social behaviour is a scourge of society, and while young people are using their time constructively with organisations such as the sea scouts, the last thing the Government needs to do is to put these people on the street.I ask the Minister of State to look sympathetically on the request of the sea scouts in Howth, by renewing their lease at No. 20, West Pier for the foreseeable future.  In his response, I ask him not to talk about public procurement processes, because it is a community we are talking about, not a commercial organisation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	823	The Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 made provision for the establishment, maintenance and management of the fishery harbour centres fund.  Orders made under the Act have provided for the transfer to the fund of all property, rights and liabilities within the six fishery harbour centres.  By way of statutory instrument, responsibility for Howth harbour was transferred from the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland on 1 January 1990.  The other five fishery harbour centres are located at Dunmore East, Castletownbere, An Daingean, Ros an Mhíl and Killybegs.The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food manages a large property portfolio in the six fishery harbour centres.  All funds generated within the fishery harbour centres, including rental income from leased property, are appropriated directly to the fishery harbour centre fund.  The fund is used for the operation and development of the harbours and there is an obligation on the Department to ensure that the property portfolio is used to its maximum potential.The Scout Association of Ireland Trust Corporation Limited signed a 20 year lease in respect of site No. 20, West Pier, Howth fishery harbour centre with effect from 1 November 1987.  At that time, the site and indeed all of Howth Harbour was owned and managed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The site was occupied by the Howth sea scouts for the full period of the lease.  A nominal annual rent was agreed with the Scout Association of Ireland Trust Corporation Limited in 1987 and was not increased during the term of the lease.  This low rent was set on the understanding that the premises would be used for scouting activities, for which there was significant demand, and on the basis that the site would be developed to the lessors' satisfaction and in accordance with the plans and specifications already approved by the lessors within a year of the lease being signed.The lease agreement contained many other clauses, one of which was that at the end of the term the lessee will "quietly yield up the demised premises with all buildings erected thereon in a good and tenantable state of repair and condition".  In 1986, the State Valuation Office advised that if the site were let on a commercial basis, the rental valuation would have been 325% more than the nominal rent agreed with the Scouting Association of Ireland Trust Corporation Limited.  There was no provision in the lease signed in 1987 that allowed for the lease to be renewed by the Scout Association of Ireland Trust Corporation Limited.The lease expired on 31 October 2007 and a two year licence to occupy the premises was issued to the Scout Association of Ireland Trust Corporation Limited on 1 November 2007, on the same basis as the original lease agreement.  This licence expired on 31 October 2009.Prior to the expiry of the licence, the Department was in contact with a representative of the sea scouts group in Howth to explore alternative accommodation within Howth fishery harbour centre.  The Department arranged discussions between the scouting group and another club based in Howth fishery harbour centre with a view to exploring the possibility of sharing accommodation. The Department is required to secure the maximum return from its resources.  The public procurement guidelines issued by the Department of Finance on the disposal or letting of Government property state:The disposal or letting of property should be dealt with by competitive tendering or by auction.  This approach provides a disposal mechanism which is both transparent and is likely to achieve a fair price.Accordingly, and in line with existing fishery harbour centre property policy, it is a requirement that the site would be valued and a public tender process put in place to award a lease on the site to the most economically advantageous tender that meets the qualifying criteria set out in the request for tender documentation.I realise the concerns of the sea scouts in this case and following the valuation of the site I intend to discuss the issues with my officials and the Department of Finance, with a view to exploring a solution that is agreeable to the sea scouts and consistent with the public procurement guidelines.  I want to acknowledge the positive proposals put forward by my party colleagues in the area which I hope will lead to a resolution.  On 22 October 2009, I had a meeting with the chief scout and the chief executive officer of Scouting Ireland.  This meeting was very informative and clearly showed the valuable work being carried out by Scouting Ireland, and particularly the volunteers who work at a local level with the sea scouts in Howth.  The Department has sought advice regarding a legal mechanism by which the sea scouts might be allowed to continue to use the premises in the short term while a request for tenders is being prepared or until a resolution is reached.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	824	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for inclusion in the Adjournment debate.  Ballintemple national school, which has an enrolment of 214 pupils, is an old school with a rich history.  It first opened its doors in 1904.  It has an excellent staff under the leadership of its principal, Mr. Denis O'Sullivan.  The school receives strong support from the local community and the active parents' association, which supports the school's activities in every way possible.  Its catchment area is the parish of Ballintemple.  The school operates from two sites.  Since 2002, the junior and senior infant classes have been based in portakabins at a site on the Blackrock Road that was provided by the SMA Fathers.  The remaining six classes are based in the old school building at Crab Lane, which is the base of the school.  The school's lease of the site that is currently occupied by the junior and senior infant classes will expire in May 2010.  The school faces a real risk that the lease will not be renewed.  I would like to know whether progress can be made with the development of a new school building for the school.  It is important to point out that approximately 700 residential units have been built in Ballintemple since 1995.  The proposal before the Department of Education and Science involves the development of a new 12-teacher school building at a 1.5 acre site on the Blackrock Road in Cork.  While the SMA Fathers have generously offered to provide the site free of charge, the Department would be unwise to assume that the offer will remain in place indefinitely.  The Department has deemed that the site in question is appropriate for the construction of a new school building.It is important to emphasise that there are serious capacity issues at Ballintemple national school at present.  I understand that eight local children were turned away this year, unfortunately, because of the lack of capacity at the school.  As a single stream school, it can accept just one class of junior infants each year.  The demographics of the area, about which I have spoken, mean that this problem will get worse in the years to come.  In advance of the 2010-11 school year, some 45 children have already sought a place in the school's single junior infants class of 28 or 30 pupils.  That demonstrates the need for the Department to take action in this regard as quickly as possible.  The proposed site, which is being made available free of charge, is in an excellent location.  There should be no other impediment to the development of this project as quickly as possible.  As I have said, the site has been deemed appropriate as the location of the new school building.  In September 2007, the Department's school planning section confirmed in writing that the Department, having conducted a technical study of the site, recommended its acquisition for the purpose of developing a new school.  It appears that no substantive progress has been made with the project since that time.  I ask the Minister for Education and Science to seriously consider the inclusion of Ballintemple national school in the Department's 2010 school capital programme.  I understand that an announcement in that regard will be made before Christmas or early in the new year.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to make the right decision so that the staff and pupils of the school can have an appropriate environment in which to teach and learn.  The children should be allowed to continue their education in what is otherwise a fabulous school environment.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who cannot be present, unfortunately.  I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects, particularly the proposed project at Scoil lósaf Naofa, Ballintemple national school.  In March 2002, the school submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding towards the provision of a new school.  The school has a current staffing level of a principal and eight mainstream teachers.  It also has the services of two learning support or resource teachers.  The school has advised the Department that a site has been offered by the SMA Fathers.  It has been agreed that appropriate accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream assistants, along with appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The school authorities were advised in September 2007 that the proposed site for the new school building was suitable for the construction of a 12-classroom school and that they should proceed with its acquisition from the SMA Fathers.As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc.  The process ultimately leads to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, each project is assigned a band rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  The criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the rating assigned to it.  There are four ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, involve the provision of buildings where none exists, but where there is a high demand for pupil places.  A band 4 project involves the provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describe the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.  The application from Scoil lósaf Naofa, Ballintemple national school, has been assigned a band 1.1 rating.As the Deputy will appreciate, the modernisation of the facilities in our existing building stock, like the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  However, the level of demand on the school building programme means that all projects cannot be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner.  This is the reasoning behind the Department's published prioritisation criteria.  The project at Scoil lósaf Naofa, Ballintemple national school, will be carried out in a manner that is consistent with this approach.  I thank the Deputy again for raising the matter and, as I have already said, to assure him that the Minister is committed to advancing the project at Ballintemple national school.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	826	I would like to begin by thanking the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, for the replies he has previously given me in response to my ongoing queries about this matter.  I accept that he has agreed to include it in the national review of school transport.  However, it would be remiss and negligent of me to fail to attempt to bring it to a conclusion.  The question of whether the children in the village of Narraghmore are outside the catchment area of the proposed bus route is a debatable one.  Although it is worth mentioning that the village is 7.2 km from Kilcullen, 7 km from Athy and 6.1 km from Dunlavin, that is not the point I wish to make.It cannot be denied that the pupils to whom I refer are entitled to travel on the school bus that leaves Narraghmore for Kilcullen each day.  While they may be travelling outside their catchment area, that does not enter the equation because there is room on the bus for them.  They are entitled to avail of the school bus service under the rule which states that children may be accommodated if there is room for them.  In this instance, there is enough room for them.  However, one aspect of this arrangement is worrying for me and the parents of these children.  The parents of 12 families, rather than being allowed to use the well-designed bus stop in the village of Narraghmore, are required to bring their children a mile and a half outside the village to gain access to the school bus service.  The children are forced to get on the bus at a crossroads that is an absolute death trap.  If common sense were to prevail in his respect, safety would be the priority and the matter would be resolved straight away.  In his previous replies to me, the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, said that any change in this arrangement could have national repercussions.I hope no child gets hurt as a result of the crazy ruling to the effect that the school bus should pass the bus stop in Narraghmore, which has been prepared by the local authority, and instead proceed to a crossroads outside the village.  The children in question also have to be driven to the crossroads.  As we enter the time of the year when the mornings and evenings are dark, it is worth pointing out as that the crossroads is unlit, the children are dropped off and collected in total darkness.  There are at least 12 cars, not counting the general traffic in the area, including milk lorries.  These are included in the photographs I have to hand.The children are entitled to be on the bus and there is no problem with the school they are attending.  The only problem is that the Department, through Bus Éireann, will not pick up and drop off the children every day at a safe, well-lit destination in the village in which they live.  It beggars belief that they are being put in such circumstances.  It affects the parents also because the crossroads are unlit and present a danger.Although the Minister of State in attendance, Deputy Killeen, is not the Minister of State responsible, I ask him to present my photographs to the Department and ask it to see the logic in what I am saying.  I ask the Department to prioritise the children's safety in making a decision.I will continue to pursue this matter.  It would be remiss and negligent of me if I did not put the children's safety first.  If they were not entitled to be on the bus, it would be a different ball game.  That is not in question here.  There is nothing in question only the location of the bus stop where the children are collected.  What is occurring is unfair and unjust.  It is wrong to make the kids travel to the crossroads.  They have to get up earlier in the morning than they should and their parents have to pool resources to transport them to the pick-up point, thereby incurring a cost.The overall picture is such that the common good is being ignored.  The Department will experience problems if a child is badly hurt as a result of what is occurring.  I hope common sense will prevail and the Department will consider my case positively.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to pass on the photographs to the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, who has helped me in every way regarding this matter, even to the point of saying it will be included in the national review.  The children are in too much danger at present and I hope common sense will prevail even before the national review is completed.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State responsible for lifelong learning, Deputy Haughey.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the general position regarding post-primary school transport for children residing in the area referred to by the Deputy.The Deputy will be aware that the provision of school transport is a massive logistical operation involving the transportation by Bus Éireann of more than 125,000 children each day to primary and post-primary schools, including more than 8,000 children with special educational needs.Under the terms of the Department's post-primary school transport scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 km or more from his or her local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which he or she lives.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area, otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can be facilitated only if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to the post-primary centre in which they live have been catered for.In regard to the specific case raised by the Deputy, the Minister has outlined in previous replies to his parliamentary questions that children availing of concessionary transport must make their own way to the catchment boundary.The safety of schoolchildren, irrespective of whether they are eligible for transport or availing of concessionary transport, is of paramount importance to the Department and to Bus Éireann.  In recent years, a range of measures to enhance safety and to improve the quality of the school transport service has been put in place, both in the vicinity of and on board school buses.  These measures include the phasing out of the three-for-two seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services and providing all children with an individual seat equipped with a seat belt.The Deputy will be aware that the planning of school bus routes, which includes the designation of pick-up and set-down points, is an operational matter for Bus Éireann.  It is a feature of the school transport scheme that children availing of transport, other than those with special needs, have to make their own way to pick-up points.The position in this case is that a child with special needs is picked up at home in accordance with the terms of the school transport scheme for children with special needs.  The bus then proceeds to the next pick-up point which is close to the catchment boundary.The children in question are not attending the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside.  Concessionary transport is not guaranteed and can be offered only from the nearest designated pick-up point under the terms of the scheme, which in this case is close to the catchment boundary. While individual cases regarding school transport are brought to the Department's attention from time to time, such cases are generally dealt with under the terms of the school transport scheme.  Persons who are not satisfied with the Department's decision may appeal to the independent school transport appeals board.The value for money review of the school transport scheme, including catchment boundaries, is due to be completed by the end of 2009.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.

The work involves, among other things, examining the approaches to regulation in other jurisdictions and considering the ethical and legal issues that arise.  It will also take into account any report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in response to the referral to it in 2005 of the Report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and the forthcoming judgment of the Supreme Court in the RvR (frozen embryos) case.The work that the Department of Health and Children is undertaking is intended to result in policy proposals for a legal framework for this area.  This work involves exploring and examining areas such as:legal parentage;access to treatment services;certain practices on gametes and in vitro embryos;donations of sperm, ova and embryos;arrangements for consent; andmany other areas that are impacted by this wide and complex area.The development and use of Assisted Human Reproduction technologies raises legal, social and ethical issues that are complex and profound.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	829	I am aware of the Irish Nurses' Organisation survey which suggests that 705 acute and non-acute beds were closed at the beginning of October 2009.  The most recent HSE acute hospital bed census indicates that, at 25 October 2009, there were 554 acute beds closed for cost containment reasons.  A further 226 beds were closed for clinical and operational reasons.  This includes infection control and refurbishment.However, it is now established best international practice to avoid focussing solely on inputs such as funding, staff and bed numbers in assessing the performance of healthcare systems.  Instead, all countries are shifting the emphasis to measuring outputs and patient outcomes.The exact number of beds available at any one time will fluctuate depending on the steps taken by each hospital to manage infection control issues, maintenance and refurbishment and to stay within its annual budget.Irrespective of this, the HSE has concentrated on delivering the levels of activity promised in its 2009 National Service Plan.The latest HSE Performance Management Report shows that by the end of August, approximately 19,000 more patients had been treated as inpatients and day cases combined than had been treated at the same stage last year.  The continued efforts by hospitals to reduce the length of time a patient remains in hospital, and converting inpatient procedures to day case work is unquestionably in the interests of patients.  It also allows hospitals to treat more patients.All initiatives which deliver better outputs and better outcomes for patients within the more limited resources available to us, will continue to have my support.  Indeed this type of approach was a central message in the recently published ESRI report.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I have no plans to review the NTPF's statutory remit.  Its operation is subject to ongoing monitoring and review to ensure that resources are used efficiently and are targeted so that they achieve the greatest benefit for patients. I have emphasised to the Fund the need for maximum cost-effectiveness, consistent with safe and effective care. I have asked it to seek even better value from private hospitals and the Fund has successfully negotiated price reductions for certain high-volume procedures.  In addition, it will not purchase services where the price is not acceptable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's Report for 2008 examined the NTPF's arrangements for the procurement of treatment.  The Report concluded "The examination suggests that, relative to the casemix benchmark, procedures purchased from private hospitals by the NTPF generally cost less than those carried out in the publicly funded hospital system".To date the NTPF has provided over 155,000 public patients with in-patient procedures and out-patient appointments.  In September 2009, the median waiting time for medical and surgical patients was 2.8 months, down from 2.5 years in 2002.The Fund's 2009 activity targets involve treating 18,875 inpatients and providing 2,000 MRIs and 5,600 outpatient appointments and it anticipates meeting these targets.  At my request, the NTPF is working actively with the HSE to focus on people waiting more than twelve months for treatment.  I am pleased to say that the number of such cases fell from 4,637 in December 2007 to 1,178 in September 2008.  The two organisations continue to work on this issue, with a view to ensuring that no person is on a waiting list for surgery for longer than 12 months.

Amongst its recommendations was that a neonatal screening programme should be established.A Steering Group, ‘Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis', was established in June 2009, under the Chairmanship of Professor Gerry Loftus, Professor of Paediatrics, Galway.  The Steering Group has broad membership from key stakeholders and experts in the field of cystic fibrosis and they will ensure that the operational work that is required to implement the Screening Programme will take place.Currently, expert advice from other jurisdictions that have introduced newborn screening for cystic fibrosis is being examined to ensure that Ireland will be in line with the most up-to-date international best practice.  In addition to the design of the newborn screening programme, including appropriate quality and governance arrangements, uniform data collection procedures will be developed for the collection of blood samples carried out in maternity units and community care areas.  These actions will be supported by training for all relevant staff and development of appropriate health promotion material for parents/guardians and relevant service providers. An annual audit process is also being put in place.It is anticipated that the implementation of the newborn screening for cystic fibrosis programme will commence next year.

The 2009 allocation is €1.888 billion.To date, the HSE's monthly Service Plan reports show that the medical card and GP visit card monthly expenditure has been within the overall expenditure projected for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor this situation as the year progresses.Based on the HSE's monthly Service Plan reports, it is estimated that there will be in the region of 1,487,000 medical cards by year end, an annual increase of some 135,000.  The estimated number of GP visit cards will be 97,600 by year end, an annual increase in the region of 12,000.  If additional funding is required it will be provided.

This is the highest ILI rate reported since sentinel influenza surveillance began in 2000.Vaccination is a key strategy that is being used to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Every person in the country will be offered the vaccine. However, initially the vaccine is arriving in small quantities due to the demand for the vaccine worldwide. Ireland is not unique in the difficulties which we have been experiencing in sourcing the vaccine in the quantities which we would require. Obviously, therefore, vaccination will be prioritised to ensure those who require it most will be first to receive it. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group have advised that the vaccine should be given to the population in the following order of priority:People with long term medical conditions aged between 6 months and 65 years and all pregnant women of more than 14 weeks gestation and for women six weeks post partum, i.e. the "clinically at risk" groups;Health Care Workers;Children between 6 months and 18 years of age;Adults over 65 years of age;The rest of the population.It is generally agreed that the preferred option for the administration of the pandemic vaccine to people under 65 in the "clinically at risk" groups is through general practice. GPs hold their medical records and are in a position to identify patients with underlying medical conditions for vaccination. It is estimated that there are approximately 410,000 people in this category.  GPs have been receiving vaccine over the last two weeks and many patients have already been vaccinated. However, not all GPs are in a position to participate in the vaccination programme and the HSE has set up special vaccination clinics in order to vaccinate the "clinically at risk" patients of such GPs.A full list of the locations and opening times of these clinics has been provided via the national and local media and is also available on the swine flu website at www.swineflu.ie.  I have arranged for a copy of this list to be sent to the Deputy.  A typical HSE vaccination clinic will comprise at least 1 doctor, 6 nurses and appropriate support staff.  It will have the capacity to vaccinate up to 500 people a day but the numbers actually vaccinated at these clinics will clearly depend on the demand from the public for this service.

The service will be provided at St Stephen's, pending the completion of a new 20 bed in-patient unit and school facility, which is currently under construction on the grounds of the Sacred Heart Convent at Bessboro, Blackrock, Cork.A Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist and a Director of Nursing have been appointed and have taken up their positions at the interim facility.  New medical, nursing and therapy staff have recently taken up employment and are currently undergoing training.  Additional staff will be appointed in due course through a combination of redeployment and recruitment.As the required staff are now in place, it is anticipated that the admission process of children to the unit will commence next week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	835	All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland have full eligibility for hospital services.  Although public hospitals treat private patients, the core purpose of the public system is to provide services for public patients. Government policy has been to ensure there is equitable access for public patients and, accordingly, that the proportion of private activity is appropriately controlled.  Furthermore care is needed to ensure that a perceived need to generate income does not operate to the detriment of service provision to public patients.  Subject to these objectives being achieved, effective mechanisms are needed to recover whatever income is due in respect of the accommodation of private patients.The overall approach to the control of private activity in publicly funded hospitals consists of a number of components.  Under the Health (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, beds in public hospitals are categorised as public, private or non-designated.   Under these regulations, no private patient being admitted electively may be accommodated in a designated public bed. The regulations contain reciprocal provisions regarding the accommodation of public patients in beds designated as private. There is provision for some exceptions to cater for emergencies and an instruction has been issued which permits the accommodation of a public patient in a designated private bed where this is necessary to manage healthcare acquired infections.Hospital consultants are subject to a maximum permitted level of private practice, the extent of which varies according to the specific contract held.  I have emphasised to the HSE the importance of effective enforcement of the terms of the consultant contract and the Executive and the management of individual hospitals are working to address those cases where individual consultants' private practice exceeds the permitted level.With the support of my Department, the HSE is working to improve business processes for collecting outstanding debts due from private health insurers in respect of patients using private facilities in public hospitals.I have no plans to alter the existing arrangements in order to enable the HSE to levy an accommodation charge in respect of the situations referred to by the Deputy as I believe it would be contrary to the fundamental purpose of public hospital services.

The recommendations of the Group will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010 which is currently underway. Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	837	In January 2007, as part of the Government's commitment to ensuring patient safety and quality in our health service, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within our healthcare system.  The Commission's report —Building a Culture of Patient Safety — was published in August 2008 and accepted by the Government in January 2009.  The Commission recommended that there should be a mandatory licensing system in Ireland to cover both public and private healthcare providers.  It further recommended that the licensing system should be implemented on a phased basis, starting with acute hospitals and other facilities based on analysis of potential risk to patient safety. My Department has already begun preparatory work on the development of legislative proposals for a mandatory licensing system to cover both public and private healthcare providers, based on explicit standards to be set by the Health Information and Quality Authority.   I intend to bring such proposals to Government by end 2010.  The Government also approved the establishment of a steering group, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of my Department, to drive implementation of all the report's recommendations.  This steering group was set up in June and has begun its work on an overall implementation plan to be completed within 18 months of establishment.A number of private providers provide cancer services and these will be encompassed in the mandatory licensing system in due course.  In the meantime, protocols for the clinical management of patients for the main site specific cancers have been, or are in the process of being, drawn up as part of the National Cancer Control Programme, in conjunction with national professional clinical bodies.  In addition, I approved Health Information and Quality Authority standards for symptomatic breast disease services in May 2007.  The aim of the standards is to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.  In 2007, my Department contacted hospitals in the independent sector urging them to take steps to ensure that their breast cancer services complied with the standards and it also brought the standards to the attention of private health care insurance providers.  My Department's Chief Medical Officer wrote to private health insurers and the independent hospital sector again last month reminding them of the importance of complying with these standards.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The ‘Medium Term Strategy for the Development of Palliative Care Services' to which the Deputy refers was published by the Health Service Executive in June and is available on the Health Service Executive Website.  This framework sets national priorities which have been agreed by all stakeholders based on solid needs analysis to ensure that services do not develop in an ad hoc fashion and that any developments proposed in future reflect areas of greatest need.  This methodology ensures an equitable approach to service provision as well as consistency in inputs such as pay and non-pay costs, and staffing levels.  The national priorities reflect the gaps that currently exist in particular areas and services and the prioritisation reflects the largest gaps.When this work was initiated its purpose was to provide a sound planning framework for resource utilisation.  It was anticipated that funding for the agreed priorities might be achieved through a combination of reorientation and reconfiguration of existing resources and the identification of additional resource requirements when further funding might come on-stream.At a meeting following the completion of the report, chaired by the Department of Health and Children and at which the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Association of Palliative Care as well as the Health Service Executive were represented, it was agreed that the priorities identified in the Framework should be progressed in the context of  reconfiguration and re-allocation of existing resources/services; increasing and developing capacity within existing resources; developing skills in community care and care of the elderly settings specifically in relation to palliative care services; and taking the opportunity afforded by integration to identify ways of enabling the delivery of these agreed national priorities.  However, all developments are subject to current budget and economic considerations.In the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 the Government allocated €21 million new development funding for palliative care.  There are now 21 palliative care consultants in post with four vacancies approved for filling, 26 home care teams and nine specialist in-patient units nationwide.  Overall spending on palliative care by the HSE in 2008 was €78 million.  Palliative care services have developed significantly over the past number of years.  Additional in-patient palliative care beds have been opened in existing hospices including  six beds in Blackrock Hospice, ten in Milford Hospice, Limerick and an additional four beds in Athlone Hospice which are due to open later this year.The HSE's August 2009 Performance Report states that the number of patients accessing palliative care services as of the 31 August was 3,612.  The majority of these patients were in receipt of home care services (2,917) accounting for 81% of the level of activity reported for the month.  Some 323 were in specialist in-patient units, 115 were in receipt of intermediate palliative care in community hospitals and 262 patients were in receipt of day care services.The provision of appropriate end of life care has been and continues to be a priority for this Government.

Many other bonuses were paid within the public service, including the HSE, in relation to 2007.  The approval of performance-related payments to eligible individual senior managers in State bodies is a matter for the boards of such bodies.Accordingly, and in line with contract terms, the performance-related payment in respect of 2007 for the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive was assessed and determined by the Board of the Health Service Executive.The Board of the HSE has agreed to suspend consideration of all performance related awards in respect of 2008.  All eligible employees, including the CEO, were informed of that decision.  No performance-related payments have been made to senior managers in the HSE in respect of 2008.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	843	In 2005, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, in conjunction with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, established an interdepartmental working group to examine the current arrangements for supporting long-term care and to identify policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care.  The group reported to the Government in January 2006 and its recommendations have informed a number of key policy developments.  With regard to nursing home care, the group offered a number of important recommendations across the areas of capacity, equity and affordability, and long-term financial sustainability.In relation to capacity, the group recommended that a comprehensive needs analysis of long-term nursing home and respite care requirements for older people should be undertaken.  On foot of this recommendation, the HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, carried out an assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia-specific and respite care beds over the period 2006-2008.  It looked at both immediate capacity requirements across the sector and projected requirements to 2036.The assessment found that, assuming 4.5% of people over age 65 require long-term nursing home care, there was a national over-provision of long-stay beds in 2006.  However, there was an under-provision of such beds in some parts of the country.  It concluded that a significant increase in capacity will be required by 2036, even assuming the percentage of people over age 65 requiring such care was reduced to 4%.  It also found there was a significant requirement for replacement, refurbishment or up-grading of existing public bed stock in order to meet modern standards.The capacity assessment provides an objective, evidence-based blueprint for the future development of nursing home care and has already informed the development of a significant number of projects under the HSE's Capital Plan and the Fast-track Initiative.  Over the period 2007 to 30 July 2009, 333 additional and 68 replacement beds have been provided nationally.  A further 603 additional and 521 replacement beds are planned for the remainder of 2009 and 2010.With regard to the issues of equity and affordability, the interdepartmental working group recommended a new policy approach in relation to supporting people in need of long-term nursing home care.  Its recommendations informed the commitments within the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, that:All relevant public services should be designed and delivered in an integrated manner around the needs of the care recipient based on a national standardised needs assessment.  Care needs assessments should be available in a timely, consistent, equitable and regionally balanced basis;Where community and home-based care is not appropriate, quality residential care should be available;There should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment;The level of state support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility;No current resident of a nursing home, public or private, should be put at a disadvantage by whatever new co-payment arrangements for residential care are introduced;These commitments are realised in the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, which commenced on 27 October 2009.  The new scheme seeks to offer assurance to people in need of nursing home care that such care will be affordable and will remain affordable for as long as it is needed.  It is complemented by another key development namely, a new regime of registration and independent inspection by HIQA of all residential care settings for older people which commenced on 1 July this year.As such, this year has seen ground-breaking change within the nursing home sector.  There is, for the first time, a single, comprehensive system of registration and inspection for all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary, and a single, comprehensive system of financial support covering all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary.  All future developments in respect of nursing home care will have to be considered in the context of these fundamental reforms.Finally, the interdepartmental working group also highlighted the need to consider long-term financially sustainable funding options to support the future provision of long-term care services (both community-based and residential) having particular regard to demographic trends.  This requirement to examine financially sustainable funding models was reiterated in Towards 2016 and preliminary work by the Department of Health and Children has commenced.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	846	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 110 and 135 together.The priorities of the Department in recent times, in relation to Services for Older People, have been the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and the bringing into force of new regulations in July last for the long-term residential care sector.In tandem with these initiatives for the residential care sector, the Department has also been progressing initiatives on the community side and, as part of this, earlier this year commenced an independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages (HCPs).  The HCP programme currently undertaken by the HSE involves overall annual funding in the region of €120 million, to provide packages to around 8,700 older people at any one time or approximately, 11,500 over the course of the year.  Such packages are intended to enable older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible and to facilitate discharge from, or prevent inappropriate admission to, acute hospitals and long-term residential care.  The HSE allocates and manages packages on this basis around the country.The Department's Evaluation , undertaken by PA Consulting Group, will be formally submitted to Minister, Deputy Harney shortly.  The aim of the evaluation was to assess, through quantitative and qualitative research at HSE national and local level, whether the objectives of the HCP Initiative are being met in the best possible way.  This evaluation was recommended by the long-term care working g roup, and reinforced by a “Towards 2016” commitment.  The Department and the HSE has accepted the need for a more standardised approach to HCP provision generally.  In the context of the forthcoming Report by PA Consulting Group, the Department is at present, in conjunction with the HSE, considering various issues in relation to HCP provision, including:finalising and agreeing standardised access and operational guidelines for delivery of Home Care Packages;adoption  and dissemination by  the HSE of a voluntary code of Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People; andconsideration of the Law Reform Commission recommendations in the context of possible changes to legislation and regulation in the area of home care for older persons generally.I am familiar with the recently launched NESF Report which focused on the implementation of home care packages from a policy implementation point of view.  It acknowledges that while the home care package initiative was a well designed policy, improvements are required in a number of areas regarding implementation, including the issues raised by the Deputies.  These issues are also being addressed in the report commissioned by the Department.It is intended that various recommendations of the PA report will be implemented or progressed over the course of 2010, including those relating to governance, operational delivery, performance management and funding.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	847	The HSE has indicated that the capital development cost of the hospital will be approximately €750 million.  It is intended that €400 million of this funding will be provided from the Exchequer.  The remainder will be raised from other sources, including philanthropic contributions.A sub-committee of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is to be established in this regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services, delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.  There is significant international and national evidence that acute complex healthcare, particularly for emergency medicine, complex surgical services and critical care should be provided in hospitals which are suitably staffed and equipped and which undertake sufficient volumes of such activity, in order to maximise clinical outcomes and ensure safe services.  At the same time, there is a significant range of less complex care which can continue to be provided safely in smaller hospitals, especially in day surgery, medicine and diagnostics.The approach being taken by the HSE in relation to the configuration of acute hospital services will result in a system which will facilitate the maximisation of patient outcomes and the further improvement of the health status of the population.The renewed programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.  The procurement process which is underway will continue.  Projects will be developed within the terms of those project agreements which have been signed or which may be signed.  Value for public money criteria remain in place and are to be met by each project.The way to provide the best possible paediatric tertiary care most effectively involves the creation of one single national paediatric hospital, alongside a major teaching hospital, bringing together all the medical and nursing expertise for complex conditions.  The concept of bringing together all three present services is widely accepted.The Children's Health First report commissioned by the Health Service Executive indicated that the population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital.  It recommended that the hospital should be in Dublin and should, ideally, be located with a leading adult academic hospital in order to optimise the outcomes for children.  Following detailed consideration, it was decided that the most appropriate location for the new National Paediatric Hospital is at the Mater Hospital.I am aware that concerns have been expressed in the past by some members of staff and families of patients and others who currently access Our Lady's Children's Hospital and the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght.  However, I welcome the recent decision by the hospital to participate fully in the development of the project and to nominate representatives to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.In 2009 the Government will provide over €250 million for the running of three children's hospitals in Dublin — Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.  The HSE is now pursuing ways in which services across the three children's hospitals can best be co-ordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.  We can achieve significant cost savings if services and practices are more closely integrated across the three hospital sites, even before the new National Paediatric Hospital has been completed.  The three children's hospitals in Dublin have agreed and developed a model for the development of a joint department of paediatric surgery.  The clinical network across the three hospitals will make the best use of the resources that are available and will ensure a ‘single system of care.'  A recruitment process is underway to recruit three replacement surgeons that will then give the joint department a complement of seven surgeons (currently five in place, with one due to retire shortly).  It is anticipated that these posts will be filled by year end.The HSE also commissioned a review of paediatric critical care facilities and services in 2008 with a view to addressing any identified deficits in advance of the opening of the new National Paediatric Hospital.  Other areas currently being examined in relation to increased co-operation are in the areas of renal services, genetics, endocrinology and dermatology services amongst others.The new National Paediatric Hospital is scheduled to become operational at the end of 2014.  Pending completion of the project, the HSE will continue to finance the provision and development of services at each of the transferring hospitals.  The new hospital will include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght. which is to open in advance of the new hospital.  The plans for this proposed Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre (AUCC)  are being developed in conjunction with the new paediatric hospital and it is proposed to have the AUCC at Tallaght completed in 2013.I understand that paediatric patients who currently attend Naas General Hospital may be transferred to Tallaght where appropriate.  These patients will continue to access services at the AUCC in Tallaght or at the new National Paediatric Hospital if their condition requires it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 124, 136 and 152 together.The incidence of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported on 25th October last is at a rate of 210.9 per 100,000 population. This is the highest ILI rate reported since sentinel influenza surveillance began in 2000.Vaccination is a key strategy that is being used to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Every person in the country will be offered the vaccine. However, initially the vaccine is arriving in small quantities due to the demand for the vaccine worldwide. Ireland is not unique in the difficulties which we have been experiencing in sourcing the vaccine in the quantities which we would require. Obviously, therefore, vaccination will be prioritised to ensure those who require it most will be first to receive it. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group have advised that the vaccine should be given to the population in the following order of priority:People with long term medical conditions aged between 6 months and 65 years and all pregnant women of more than 14 weeks gestation and for women six weeks post partum, i.e. the "clinically at risk" groups;Health Care Workers;Children between 6 months and 18 years of age;Adults over 65 years of age;The rest of the population.It is generally agreed that the preferred option for the administration of the pandemic vaccine to people under 65 in the "clinically at risk" groups is through general practice. GPs hold their medical records and are in a position to identify patients with underlying medical conditions for vaccination. It is estimated that there are approximately 410,000 people in this category.  GPs have been receiving vaccine over the last two weeks and many patients have already been vaccinated. However, not all GPs are in a position to participate in the vaccination programme and the HSE has set up special vaccination clinics in order to vaccinate the "clinically at risk" patients of such GPs.A full list of the locations and opening times of these clinics has been provided via the national and local media and is also available on the swine flu website at www.swineflu.ie. A typical HSE vaccination clinic will comprise at least 1 doctor, 6 nurses and appropriate support staff.  It will have the capacity to vaccinate up to 500 people a day but the numbers actually vaccinated at these clinics will clearly depend on the demand from the public for this service.Staff being assigned to the vaccination clinics will not be replaced and the vaccination programme will, therefore, mean that some other services have to be delayed or curtailed.  The HSE has drawn up plans to prioritise services during the period of the vaccination programme but the actual impact on particular services will only become clear as the programme is rolled out. The intention is to start vaccinating other priority groups, like health care workers and children, as soon as possible.  However, depending on uptake, vaccine supplies and other factors, it could take 6 to 8 months to vaccinate the entire population.With regard to legal protection for general practitioners the HSE has asked GPs to make their best effort to identify the relevant patients and the insurance companies involved in providing cover for GPs have indicated that this would be seen as normal GP work and that the existing cover is sufficient.The House will appreciate that this pandemic is one of the biggest public health challenges which this country has faced. The logistics of undertaking such a mass vaccination programme are challenging. I am confident, however, that the extensive preparation plans which we have in place will assist in meeting this challenge.

A number of measures to address this are being pursued, including:The HSE is in discussion with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) regarding the scope for increasing the 120 GP training places currently available each year.The HSE and the ICGP are also in discussion to identify a mechanism for up-skilling long-term locums or assistants who are currently not eligible for GMS contracts.A list of GMS GP posts has been advertised centrally on the HSE Website.A recruitment drive is being undertaken in the UK and EU countries to attract qualified GPs to Ireland.The HSE is encouraging GP assistantships and partnerships in relation to upcoming retirements.The HSE is issuing new GMS panels in regions urgently requiring additional GPs.Some previous restrictions on entry to the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme have been removed.The maximum retirement age for GPs holding contracts under the GMS and other schemes has been extended from 65 to 70.  I am confident that these measures will have a positive impact on GP numbers.

All three hospitals prioritise their services in accordance with clinical need.Careful planning of critical care services, including those for cardiac patients, is vital.  To this end, the HSE commissioned the DNV Consortium management consultancy to review current paediatric critical care facilities and services in Our Lady's Children's Hospital and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street with a view to developing paediatric intensive care services in the period leading up to the opening of the new national paediatric hospital.The Irish Paediatric Critical Care network has been established by the HSE with an independent chair to progress the report's recommendations.  Additional revenue funding has been allocated to the hospitals this year to commence the implementation of these recommendations. Three new posts of consultant paediatric intensivists have been approved recently.The HSE has committed to progressing a capital development at Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin to secure additional high quality critical care beds at the hospital as quickly as possible.  It must also be stressed that the provision of additional ICU beds is an interim measure pending the completion of the new National Paediatric Hospital, which will combine the services provided by the three paediatric hospitals in Dublin.The HSE has committed to replacing 13 of Crumlin Hospital's existing ICU beds and to introduce 4 new ICU beds, within 18 months.  This will bring the total number of ICU beds at the hospital to 25.  The design allows for the provision of an additional 5 ICU beds, subject to approval.   A tender for design consultancy services relating to this project has recently been approved.  The project team has already met the design team to advance the project in as short a time frame as possible.The HSE and Crumlin Hospital are examining options to address the current cardiac waiting list service need in advance of the new ICU project being completed.

The Service Plan must inter alia reflect the policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government.Significant progress was made in the HSE Service Plan 2009 in terms of incorporating more explicit links between funding, staffing and services and the development of an improved set of activity measures, performance indicators and deliverables in key service areas, including in the mental health area, which are matched with timescales.  The HSE reports monthly to my Department on the performance of the health system against the agreed targets.   My Department is continuing to work with the HSE to further refine and develop appropriate performance measures in mental health in 2010.The modernisation of mental health services in line with ‘A Vision for Change’is the responsibility of the HSE.  It can be achieved to a significant extent through the remodelling of existing resources.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	854	The Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade is being implemented in the health sector in such a way as to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians. The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services. Following a submission from the Health Service Executive earlier this year, it was agreed that special provisions would also apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.The operation of the framework, including the moratorium on recruitment, is kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive.

My Department has completed a public consultation on the matter and has indicated that the following measures may be circulated from the outset:Restrict the use of sunbeds to those 18 years and over;Ban commercial sunbed services where such services are not supervised;Require the placing of warning signs in prominent places on premises where sunbed services are offered;Require the placing of warning labels on sunbeds, whether for sale or use on business premises;Require proprietors of sunbed businesses offering sunbed services to register with the HSE;Introduce enforcement provisions to enable inspections to be carried out and penalties for non-compliance;Allow exemptions in respect of the use of sunbeds for medical use.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for product safety matters generally and discussions have been arranged between the two Departments to consider product safety matters arising in the context of the proposed legislation.The timing of when these provisions might be introduced is dependent on consideration by Government and the legislative process. In addition, it should be noted that it is a requirement of the Transparency Directive that the EU Commission be notified of legislation which proposes to change the basis on which a product or service is regulated in a particular Member State. This provides an opportunity for Member States and the Commission to submit observations on the draft legislation.

Since then, a draft project brief has been prepared and a Cost Benefit Analysis has been completed but none of the work undertaken to date has been site specific.  A number of difficulties have now emerged with the Thornton Hall site; the HSE has identified a need for an Intellectual Disability Forensic Mental Health Unit and a Child and Adolescent Forensic Mental Health Unit but the twenty acre site at Thornton Hall is not large enough to allow for these additional developments.  Neither of the units would be viable as a stand alone facility and they should be co-located with the CMH.  Moreover, the construction of these additional units at a location separate to the CMH would incur increased capital and revenue costs.  In these circumstances and in the context of the commitment in the Revised Programme for Government, the question of the relocation of the CMH to an alternative site is currently under consideration.

In 2008, 18% of prescription items under the GMS scheme and 11% of items under the Drugs Payment Scheme and Long Term Illness Scheme were dispensed generically. My Department and the HSE supports the increased use of generics where this is appropriate. All options for containing pharmaceutical expenditure pharmaceutical expenditure, including the introduction of a system of generic reference pricing, the promotion of more cost-effective prescribing by GPs, greater use of generic preparations and quality prescribing indicators are under consideration.A group, chaired by Dr Michael Barry, and comprising of representatives of my Department, the Health Services Executive and the Irish Medical Organisation, was established to oversee the implementation of specific measures that would deliver more cost effective prescribing by GPs, greater use of generic preparations and quality prescribing indicators. In the past year the HSE has worked closely with healthcare professionals to develop quality prescribing indicators for oral nutritional products. This will reduce wastage and inappropriate prescribing of these products while ensuring that patients can access them as required. I am due to meet with the IMO shortly to discuss how the implementation of other measures can be progressed.Under the terms of the current agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers, price cuts of 35% have been applied to all off-patent proprietary products for which generic alternatives are available on the Irish market. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics has estimated that off-patent price reductions will have resulted in savings of €250 million in the period from March 2007 to August 2010. The HSE has given notice to both the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association of its intention to renegotiate the agreements which govern the supply terms, conditions and prices of medicines supplied under the GMS and other community drugs schemes. Further savings will be sought by the HSE when the agreements are renegotiated in 2010.Other reforms have also been introduced to lower the cost of medicines. I recently reduced the wholesale mark-up payable on medicines from 17.66% to 10% and reduced the retail mark-up payable under certain schemes from 50% to 20%. Savings from the measures have been estimated at €55 million for 2009 and €133 million on a full year basis.It is my intention to introduce a system of reference pricing, coupled with generic substitution by pharmacists at the patient's request. My Department and the HSE are examining options to progress this initiative which has the potential to promote the usage of cheaper generic medicines and provide further savings from reductions in prices.

The purpose of the trip was to learn lessons from visits to world leading medical institutions with particular emphasis on the latest developments in cancer care and on developing a new oral/dental policy for Ireland. Along with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Dental Advisor, I visited the healthcare facilities with a view to seeing, at first hand, how services are planned, organised and delivered. These included the Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, the Arizona School of Dentistry and Oral Health, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, Texas and the Veterans Administration (V.A.) Medical Centre in Washington DC. I also met with Professor Provonost of the Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. The visit allowed discussion with top American medical professionals along with senior Irish doctors who have made a career in the US.MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston is one of the largest hospitals in the world dealing with approximately 80 thousand cancer cases a year. It has ranked as the number one cancer hospital in the United States for 6 of the last 9 years.On the recommendation of my Chief Dental Advisor I visited the Arizona School of Dentistry and Oral Health. Regarded as one of the most innovative centres for dental training in the world, the visit was helpful to the process of developing a new oral policy here in Ireland.The Mayo Clinic is internationally renowned as a centre of medical excellence.The Veterans Administration has an international reputation for delivering efficient and high quality health services at lower costs than many other parts of the US Healthcare System. The VA hospital in Washington has an increasing emphasis on moving to community based services, using the latest technology in managing chronic illnesses and reducing in-hospital stays, and reducing the cost of treatment.Our meeting with Professor Provonost of Johns Hopkins University Hospital dealt with aspects of their work on infection control standards. Techniques used by the hospital have delivered significant reductions in the transmission of infection.I met with the Deputy Secretary, US Department of Health and Human Services, Mr Tevi D. Troy to discuss matters of mutual interest in regard to health policy and health care delivery.The trip also afforded an opportunity to meet with Science Foundation Arizona, with Craig Barrett, Chairman of Intel and other business leaders as well as members of the Irish Community.I also met with members of the Arizona state senate, members of the House of Representatives and with Governor Janet Ann Napolitano (now the United States Secretary for Homeland Security).Details of the party which travelled to the United States are set out below.

Pending completion of the project, the HSE will continue to finance the provision and development of services at each of the transferring hospitals.The development of the National Paediatric Hospital is a priority project for the Government. The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which was established in May, 2007. The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion and commissioning in 2014.The new hospital will be based at the Mater Hospital and will include an associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght, which is to open in advance of the new hospital.  The plans for this proposed Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre (AUCC)  are being developed in conjunction with the proposed new paediatric hospital and it is proposed to have the AUCC at Tallaght completed in 2013.This Centre will offer a wide range of services including urgent care consultations, outpatient services and day surgery.

One of the key recommendations of the Implementation Plan is that an additional 270 additional social workers be recruited by the HSE between 2009 and 2011.  This is made possible as the approved Employment Control Framework for the HSE exempts social worker posts from the current moratorium on recruitment and the filling of vacancies.A further key action of the Plan which is currently being implemented is the conversion of temporary social work posts to a permanent basis to address issues of continuity of care and staff retention within the child welfare and protection services. The need to recruit further additional social workers beyond this cohort will be considered in the light of progress made in delivering necessary reforms in the child welfare and protection service.

The role of my Office is to improve the lives of children and young people and to bring greater coherence and cohesion to policies that impact on their lives.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, Section 1 provides for sections of the Act to be commenced at different stages.  Sections 2-7, 17 and 18 have been commenced to date.  The National Youth Work Advisory Committee has been reviewing the implementation of the Act and is finalising its recommendations on its further implementation.  These recommendations will be considered in the context of the remit of my Office as outlined above.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	867	In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.The HSE will be focusing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this. The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts certain front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium and it allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800) for the health sector.  The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services.  In addition, special provisions apply in relation to certain specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided.  The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.The operation of the framework, including the moratorium on recruitment, is kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive.The HSE has advised that the filling of key front line vacancies associated with the reconfiguration of Acute Services in both the North East and Mid West regions is proceeding at present on the basis of redeployment of resources made available by the reshaping of the services in those regions. These arrangements operate within the requirement to maintain services.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	868	Approximately 60% of our disease burden is accounted for by 7 leading risk factors.  These are tobacco, alcohol, cholesterol, overweight, high blood pressure, poor diet and physical inactivity.  Almost 80% of heart disease, stroke and diabetes could be avoided if major risk factors were eliminated.The recent Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition (SLAN 2007) showed the level of these risk factors in the adult population with high levels of physical inactivity, 80% of the population eating too much energy dense foods, smoking rates that have plateaued, 64% of the population having high blood pressure and approximately three quarters having high cholesterol.SLAN found evidence that positive lifestyles behaviours, including being physically active, eating sufficient fruit and vegetables, not smoking and drinking in moderation exert a profound impact on health.The control of many of these factors lies outside the direct influence of the health services.  Recognising that inter-sectoral action is required, my Department is taking the lead role in developing various policies and initiatives aimed at addressing these lifestyle issues.Among these initiatives are the establishment of an Inter-sectoral Group on Obesity, the launch of National Guidelines on Physical Activity, the development of a new Cardiovascular Health Policy and the establishment of a steering group to develop a National Substance Misuse Strategy.

These representations were forwarded to the Health Service Executive with a request that the matter be examined and a direct reply issued to the correspondent.  The Health Service Executive has also been asked, arising from its consideration of the matter, to notify my Office in the event that there are any issues which it considers should be brought to my attention.

The Framework incorporates the general moratorium on recruitment in the public sector.  However, the moratorium has been modulated to minimise the impact on front line services and, in particular, on areas such as disability, services for older people, and child care.As part of the Health Estimate for 2009, I announced that there was to be a 3% reduction in management/administration grades in the health sector in 2009.  This reduction is encompassed within the Framework.  The reduction in management/administration grades in 2009 to the end of September, the latest data available, is 341.52 wholetime equivalents.  The HSE has outlined to my Department that it expects the 3% target to be reached by the end of the year, as planned. In addition, the Government will be considering a number of options in framing public expenditure projections for 2010.

The primary function of the Review Body is to advise the Government from time to time on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to certain public sector posts, including higher management grades in the health service not covered by the Public Sector Benchmarking Body process.The level of awards made to individual senior managers in the HSE is solely a matter for the HSE Board and my Department has, therefore, asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.No bonus payments have been made to senior managers in the HSE in respect of 2008.  At its meeting on 9th July 2009, in response to a request from my Department, the Board of the Executive formally decided to suspend consideration of all performance related awards for 2008 in the HSE pending receipt of further guidelines from central government. All eligible employees were informed of that decision.Since the payment of bonuses is related to performance in the preceding year, no such payments have been made in respect of 2009.

These were linked to wider recommendations around the science, technology and innovation activities of other Government Departments and research agencies.  The Government will consider the full range of relevant issues in assessing this recommendation.In any event I can assure all concerned of the Government's commitment to health research.  The benefits of high quality health research activity have been highlighted by the Government in for example, Building Ireland's Smart Economy and the Revised Programme for Government.  Just today I published an Action Plan for Health Research which sets out a range of actions to further improve the quality and extent of health research.  The Action Plan contains a commitment to continuing close liaison with the voluntary sector, in particular medical charities.

IDA Ireland met with IFF on a number of occasions in recent months in both Ireland and the US.  Consolidation of Drogheda was discussed with a view to adding some additional activities during which IDA outlined a number of supports that could be provided if the investment was made in Drogheda.  This was acknowledged by IFF with the commitment that it would be forwarded to its operating committee and taken into consideration in its final decision. The employees also put forward a cost reduction plan.On 14th October, I met with a deputation of employees from IFF.  Following this, I met with IFF in New York on Friday 23rd October 2009 and detailed the case in favour of Ireland.On 28th October the Company issued a statement that the decision to proceed with the closure of the Drogheda facility had been reached with production to cease on 30 September 2010 following a phased redundancy programme commencing in the second quarter of 2010.The decision by the company is most regrettable and I have asked the State development agencies to ensure that they provide every possible assistance and support to the workers who will lose their jobs in the coming year.

A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 — 2007 an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to the prevailing maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay of €600.The issue of ex gratia payments in excess of statutory minimum entitlements is entirely a matter for negotiation between the employer and the employees and is likely to depend on the individual circumstances of the case and the financial position of the employer.  This is not an area in which the Tánaiste or I have any role.  Recent cases which have come before the Labour Relations Commission suggest that there is no norm in this regard with settlement terms varying considerably from two weeks in excess of the statutory minimum up to six weeks.As regards redundancy programmes in the public sector, these would not normally come within the realm of the Redundancy Payments Scheme unless the employee was contributing at the full rate of PRSI.

The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.In April 2000 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced capped limits on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3 years total time on CE from 3rd April, 2000 — participation on CE before this date is disregarded). CE capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, avail of the programme.

The ISER was intended to apply in the health sector.However, its application in the health sector was suspended by the Health Service Executive (HSE) because staff associations instructed their members not to co-operate with redeployment and other flexibility measures.  While the HSE continued to accept applications under the scheme, the processing of these applications to final decision was suspended pending confirmation of union co-operation with the ISER.  The most up to date information available is that 305 ISER applications have been received within the health sector.

In such circumstances, the transaction is treated as giving rise to neither a gain nor a loss for CGT purposes and thereby Capital Gains Tax would not be payable on such a donation.I am further advised by Revenue that income tax relief for donations to charities under Section 848A of the TCA 1997 only applies where the donation takes the form of money or designated securities; it does not apply to a donation of land.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	896	In his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009, the Minister for Finance announced that he would make available three schemes to reduce the number of public sector employees in the wider public sector.  The Minister for Finance stated that at that time that the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement would be the only scheme providing for early retirement in the public sector. Therefore my Department issued a suite of three circulars to the HSE on 15 May 2009 to give effect to this measure in the public health sector; the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (8/2009); the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (Circular 9/2009) and the Shorter Working Year (10/2009).The purpose of these circulars is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff employed, along with an associated restructuring of organisation and operations, in as timely a manner as possible and in line with the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector.  While the reduction in numbers achieved under these schemes is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer, this must be done in a way that does not undermine essential service provision.The schemes do not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector. Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to these schemes, provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the schemes while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the schemes will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.My Department was informed that the health service trade unions issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  The unions have stated their opposition to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, referred to above.  This instruction from the unions severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.  As a result, the HSE has suspended all three schemes on 18 June and the suspension remains in place.  One person in the public health sector had been approved to exit the system by that date and cost of the 10% lump sum paid was €2,307 with an annual pension payable of €11.102 per annum.I understand that applications continued to be accepted by the relevant employer up to the closing date of 23rd October pending resolution of the outstanding industrial relations issues. I have been informed that the HSE has had discussions with the health service unions regarding its policy on redeployment/reassignment and these discussions are ongoing.

I have clearly indicated my intention to await the finalisation of the International Social Services Report on inter-country Adoption in Vietnam before making final decisions regarding the next steps. I will be considering the Report along with the Report published in August by the Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I anticipate the ISS report will be finalised this month. I will be communicating my decision at the earliest opportunity. I am extremely mindful of the difficult position many prospective adopters find themselves at this point in time.Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai visited Ireland recently. I took the opportunity to meet again with Minister Hai whom I had met with during my July visit to Vietnam. The meeting took place on the 23rd October. Adoption matters were discussed. The meeting was most amicable and allowed both Governments to outline their current positions in relation to the bilateral agreement and legislative developments in each jurisdiction, including Hague Convention ratification. Both Governments restated their desire to achieve the highest standards in inter-country adoption and they committed to ongoing dialogue to advance these goals.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill.  However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, have been raised with me by representative groups.  I am currently examining this and other related matters.My officials, in consultation with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, have been doing preparatory work on a possible bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. Consideration of this is at an early stage.

However, on average, the following timelines are estimated (assuming that the submitted application is fully and correctly completed):Straightforward State Support Application: 1-2 weeksStraightforward Ancillary State Support Application: 3-4 weeksIt must be acknowledged that, in the initial months following the introduction of the scheme, the HSE will have to deal with a huge volume of applications from both existing residents and new entrants. However, this should not impact negatively on existing residents due to the safeguards provided within the primary legislation. The legislation provides that applicants to the scheme who were in nursing home care on the date the scheme commenced (27th October 2009) shall have their State support backdated to that date. Moreover, the HSE's Guidelines on the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme state that, subject to overall resources, people who enter nursing homes after the commencement of the scheme will have their financial support paid either from the date that the application was made or from date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.

However, a number of joint meetings between officials from Ireland and Vietnam were held on an ad-hoc basis to support the implementation of the Agreement. Representatives of my Department and/or the Adoption Board met with their Vietnamese counterparts as required to review issues relating to adoptions from Vietnam on foot of the Agreement. Officials from my Department visited Vietnam on at least 5 occasions since the signing of the bilateral agreement in 2003.During the course of these visits some of the matters discussed included co-operation on technical assistance, staff training, providing assistance to State competent authorities involved in adoption and the care of children as referred to in Article 24 of the Bilateral Agreement.The issue of humanitarian aid is referred to in Article 8. 2 of the Bilateral Agreement which states that "when applying for a licence to operate in the state of origin an authorised organisation must submit its non-profit plan, including humanitarian financial assistance for nurturing institutions in the State of Origin". Article 24 allows for the reviewing and evaluating of this aid by the Joint Working Group. However, the Irish Government had no role in authorising any amounts payable or which organisation in the sending country received such monies. Governance and accounting issues in relation to humanitarian aid were discussed during more recent meetings.The issues discussed at all meetings fed into the thinking and drafting of future bilateral agreements and also informed the deliberations on the inter-country adoption aspects of the Adoption Bill, 2009.Questions Nos. 186 and 187 answered with Question No. 100.

Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.The HSE commissioned Horwath Consulting Ireland, in association with Teamwork Management Services, to carry out a review of acute hospital services in the HSE South, based on the principle of securing sustainable and clinically safe acute hospital services.  The report was launched publicly on 9 June 2009.  Professor John Higgins was appointed as Director of Reconfiguration of Acute Services, Cork & Kerry Region.  The Teamwork report proposes a single health care system for Cork and Kerry, with a new governance structure for hospitals and community to encompass the relationship between the health care system and the third level educational sector — UCC and Cork and Tralee ITs.  The key principles are that complex clinical care should be concentrated on the Cork University Hospital campus and that the other hospitals should, where possible, provide an expanded range of day surgery, diagnostic and out patient services.  The reconfiguration process involves both enhancing primary care services and moving hospital services as close as practicable to people's homes.It is clear that hospitals will have to change significantly the type of services they provide and the way these are delivered.  Reorganisation of services must of course occur in consultation with the key stakeholders and on an incremental basis.  I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time.As the specific question raised by the Deputy is a matter for the HSE, it has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	915	I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 203 together.The Department of Health and Children does not collect information on children identified with Autism and Aspergers on a national or international basis.  Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of Autism or any other disability.In 2004, the Department of Health and Children, through the Health Research Board, approved expenditure of €5 million on autism research to help improve international understanding of the genetic causes of autism.  This €5 million is the Irish contribution to a new major international research initiative called the Autism Genome Project which will receive a total investment of €12 million from a variety of international organisations over three years.  The other co-funders in the international consortium include Autism Speaks (US), the British Medical Research Council (MRC), Southwest Autism Research and Resource Centre (SARRC), and the Hilibrand Foundation.  This unique combination of international, public and private partners funding a consortium of clinicians and scientists is a new and welcome departure in the field of autism research.The Health Research Board has informed my Department that this funding was awarded as follows:€2.8 million: Professor Michael Gill, Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin€2.2 million: Professor Andrew Green, Director National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (affiliated to UCD).This figure represents the largest tranche of funding to be awarded by any of the four funders within the international consortium.  The Irish researchers are at the forefront in unravelling the genetic determinants of autism and related disorders.  They are using novel state of the art genetic sequencing technology to analyse DNA samples taken from autistic patients to identify candidate genetic markers for autism.  They will collaborate with their international colleagues to then link these genetic markers with clinical outcomes.  This unique international research effort will greatly improve not only our understanding of the causes of autism, but its diagnosis and treatment.With regard to the remaining matters raised by the Deputy, these relate to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act, 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

All medicines and vaccines that are authorized for use in Ireland must first be tested in clinical trials.  The products are only authorised if they are deemed to be of acceptable quality, safety and efficacy.  The benefits must always outweigh the risks before the any product is authorized for use.One Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine (Boostrix) is currently authorised and marketed for use in Ireland.  Boostrix is authorised in Ireland (and in many EU member states) through the mutual recognition procedure since 2001.  Some of the known side effects with Boostrix are as follows: somnolence (drowsiness), irritability, diarrhoea, vomiting, anorexia, pyrexia (fever > 37.5°C), injection site reactions (such as redness and/or swelling), and injection site pain.Two 5:1 vaccines are authorised for use in Ireland: Pentavac and Infanrix Penta.  Infanrix Penta is licensed through the centralised system which means the same licence applies in all 27 member states.  Some of the known side effects with Infanrix Penta are as follows: somnolence (drowsiness), cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, dermatitis, rash, urticaria, lost appetite lost, fever = 38°C, local swelling at the injection site (= 50 mm), fatigue, pain, redness.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	918	I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  In March 2007, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan. An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the period of the Plan the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.A National Surveillance system was established by the HSE to collect data and provide information to monitor HCAIs in our health system.  The number of MRSA bloodstream infections for the past three years are — 588 cases in 2006, 536 cases in 2007 and 436 cases in 2008.  This shows a significant decrease of over 25% between 2006 and 2008.  The data is collated on a quarterly basis and for the first six months of 2009 the number of MRSA bloodstream infections were 191 which a reduction of over 20% from the first six months of 2008 when the cases numbered 241.Up until May 2008, C. difficile was not a notifiable disease and, as a result, it was difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the healthcare system.  Since May 4th 2008, all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  These are reported on a weekly basis and the number of cases reported nationally from May to December 2008 was 1625 and from January to 17th October 2009 was 1574.In order to introduce measures to aid in the reduction of antibiotic prescribing, education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics commenced last year.  The HSE launched a three week awareness campaign in November 2008 to highlight the importance of using antibiotics properly.  This coincided with the first European Antibiotic Awareness Day.  The awareness campaign included radio ads and distribution of leaflets on the prudent use of antibiotics.  Earlier this year, new environmental guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments were published by the HSE.HIQA, since its establishment in 2007, has also taken significant steps in this area.  A core function of the Authority is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  In 2007, HIQA developed National Hygiene Standards and commenced a programme of audit against these Standards.  The Authority undertook a comprehensive inspection and review of hygiene in our acute public hospitals in 2007 and again in 2008.  This included unannounced visits by inspection teams.  The reports, which were published, represent a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  HIQA noted that the standard of front line services which was already very high in 2007 had been maintained in 2008 and that corporate governance was significantly improved.In May 2009, HIQA published its National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections to provide an overall framework for health and social care providers to prevent or minimise the occurrence of HCAIs.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of HCAIs namely governance, hygiene, microbiological services, antimicrobial resistance and surveillance systems as well as relevant aspects of the design of facilities.  Six months will now be allowed for the development by the HSE of a self-assessment tool, gap analysis and implementation plan before HIQA commences its initial review against those Standards.I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	920	The fundamental objective of Government health policy continues to be to maximise the health status of the population.  The Government is committed to ensuring quality health services delivered efficiently and effectively.  Ensuring patient safety is paramount, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.The HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised in particular regions.  These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services in the regions concerned, particularly in relation to accident and emergency services, critical care, acute surgery and medicine.  Importantly, the programme also involves developing smaller hospitals to provide a much greater proportion of less complex care, especially in day surgery, medicine and diagnostics.  This underlines the fact that smaller hospitals can be reconfigured to provide important services in their local community.A recent example of reconfiguration in relation to the delivery of specialist services is the development of designated centres for cancer care. A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland 2006 identified an evidence-based requirement for specialist cancer centres each serving a population of 500,000, meaning that eight would be required.  It recommended, inter alia, that all cancer care should be provided through a system of four Managed Cancer Control Networks, each with two cancer centres.  Under the National Cancer Control Programme, cancer diagnostic and surgical services are being progressively transferred into these eight centres in order to ensure the delivery of care in accordance with best international practice.In 2007, I established the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) as part of the Health Reform Programme.  A core function of HIQA is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  HIQA has already developed national quality standards in areas such as Symptomatic Breast Disease Standards, National Hygiene Standards and National Standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  Work has also commenced on the development of National Quality Standards for acute hospitals in the public sector.  HIQA standards will apply to all public health services wherever appropriate.In January 2007, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and it reported to me in July 2008.  Following on from recommendations by the Commission and in line with commitments made in the Renewed Programme for Government, my Department has begun preparatory work on the development of legislative proposals for a mandatory licensing system to cover both public and private healthcare providers, based on explicit standards to be set by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Other recommendations to be implemented include the introduction of a programme of clinical audit across all health services, adverse event reporting, learning dissemination and a system of credentialing for healthcare professionals.I believe that all of these measures are contributing to an improvement in the quality and standard of our health service.

The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology and a Transition Team has been established to oversee developments.No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.  I understand that the Friends of St. Luke's are preparing a report on possible future uses of the site and facilities and I hope to receive a copy of this report shortly.It is important to note that the complete transfer of services from St. Luke's Hospital to new facilities at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  A partial transfer will occur in the last quarter of 2010.  In the meantime, additional linear accelerators were commissioned at St. Luke's last year in order to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.

In practice, a necessary period of time elapses while applications that have been approved have their certificates of naturalisation prepared, as certificates must be printed, signed and sealed under strict controls. A certificate of naturalisation will issue to the person concerned in the near future.

At that stage, unfortunately, our enquiries revealed that the person concerned had already been forcibly returned to Gaza on the day she was detained. I understand that she is still in Gaza at present.Through our Missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah, we have brought this case to the attention of the EU Presidency and partners on the ground, who will follow closely any developments in the case.There appears to be no credible justification for forcing the person concerned to return to Gaza, and preventing her from completing her studies, simply because she came from there originally.  There does not seem to be any question — or suggestion — of any security danger relating to her presence in Bethlehem.  It should be obvious that young Palestinians like her, who despite her difficult background is just a few weeks short of graduating with a Degree in Business, represent the best hope for a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians alike, and should be encouraged.This Israeli action has very negative implications for the future of Bethlehem University and the ability of young Palestinians to receive third level education.  I call upon the Israeli authorities to reverse this apparently unjustified and mistaken action, and allow the person concerned to return to Bethlehem immediately.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	931	Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  The Department is working closely with the PRTB to ensure that all tenancies where rent supplement is in payment are registered with the PRTB.  To that end, the Department provides details of new rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.Landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) within one month from the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  There are also instances where a rent supplemented tenancy need not be registered with the PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a premises is owner occupied.Rent supplemented tenancies which are liable for registration with the PRTB, should be so registered.  In that regard, the close working arrangements which the Department has with the PRTB should ensure that over time, all tenancies that come within the area of rent supplementation comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.

Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements are components of the SWA Scheme.  Provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 for the transfer.  These provisions are subject to a Commencement Order.A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed.  Talks are currently underway at the Labour Relations Commission to try to resolve issues raised by the trade unions representing staff due to transfer from the HSE.  The first meeting of the parties took place on 22 September in the LRC with two further meetings taking place in October.  Meetings are continuing in an effort to achieve a collective agreement with these unions, the next of which is scheduled for 17th November.  Discussions have also taken place with the unions representing the staff in the Department in relation to the transfer proposal.The management side's intention is to reach agreement with all of the unions concerned as soon as is practical so that the transfer can be implemented as early as possible in 2010.

Persons who are in receipt of carer's allowance also receive the annual respite care grant, the household benefits package and the free travel pass.In the majority of cases, persons who are being cared for will be in receipt of a payment in their own right (for example a state pension or disability allowance) and will be entitled to have a free travel pass.  This includes anyone aged over 16 who qualifies for disability allowance.For a child requiring full-time care who is under age 16, a domiciliary care allowance of €309.50 per month may be paid to the parent or guardian.  This payment is not means tested and is to provide for the additional costs involved in providing care and supervision that is substantially more than that normally needed by a child of the same age.  This may include additional travel costs.A child who is attending school may be eligible for assistance under the Department of Education and Science's school transport scheme.I have no plans at present to review the qualifying criteria for the free travel scheme or to provide free travel passes for children other than those who are in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department.

This review is currently underway and a significant milestone was reached recently when consultants delivered a major international report on waste management policy.  I am currently examining this report and its recommendations, which will be central to informing what further measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste management services.  I will shortly publish the report to facilitate a full interaction with stakeholders in the context of a set of recommendations which address issues surrounding the management of waste at each level of the waste hierarchy, together with associated institutional and regulatory issues.  I will also be bringing necessary legislative and policy proposals to Government.I also recently arranged for environmental consultants to prepare an Environmental Report, according to Strategic Environmental Assessment requirements, to inform the policy making process for waste management in respect of a proposed policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act which would be intended to achieve a number of objectives.One such objective is to seek to ensure that incineration capacity does not reach a level such that waste is drawn to incineration which could have been dealt with by prevention, reuse, recycling, composting/anaerobic digestion of source segregated biowaste, MBT or other methods which are higher up the waste hierarchy.In advance of finalising the Strategic Environmental Assessment comments on the environmental report were invited from relevant stakeholders, and any other interested parties, which attracted a wide range of submissions, a number of which were very detailed and technical.  My Department is currently considering the submissions and in accordance with Article 18 of the SEA Regulations the next stage in the SEA process will be the preparation of an SEA statement.

Every six months SEI publishes a report on Understanding Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland which details electricity and gas prices to every category of domestic and industrial user and compares those figures with other Member States of the European Union.  In June 2007, the EU Commission adopted a new EU-wide methodology for gathering energy price data.  This new methodology was applied to all statistics gathered from July 2007 onwards.  SEI advises that the compilation of meaningful comparative price statistics prior to July 2007 is not readily achievable without undue commitment of staff resources and administrative costs.The tables provided by SEI include a comparison of industrial electricity and gas prices between the UK and Ireland from July 2007, in the most common bands of volume consumption.  The price excluding VAT was used as this is the most relevant for industrial/services consumers and the UK price was converted to Euros at the average sterling exchange rate for the 6-month period in question.  Clearly, exchange rate differentials over this period will also have an impact on the price comparisons.Electricity Prices to Industrywithout VAT (c/kWh)Band IC – Annual Electricity Consumption500 < 2,000 MWhJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland12.3513.0214.1913.14United Kingdom10.789.7710.8811.17Band ID – Annual Electricity Consumption 2,000 < 20,000 MWhJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland10.8612.0112.7611.07United Kingdom9.448.8010.1010.18Band IE- Annual Electricity Consumption 20,000 < 70,000 MWhJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland10.9411.9111.509.67United Kingdom8.858.539.779.98Band IF – Annual Electricity Consumption 70,000 < 150,000 MWhJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland10.26..10.048.79United Kingdom8.468.809.949.78Gas Prices to Industrywithout VAT (€/GJ)Band I2 – Annual Gas Consumption 1,000< 10,000 GJJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland10.8310.8812.7010.51United Kingdom8.938.899.749.33Band I3 – Annual Gas Consumption 10,000< 100,000 GJJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland9.7211.0510.999.30United Kingdom7.177.738.698.35Band I4 – Annual Gas Consumption 100,000< 1,000,000 GJJuly 07 – Dec 07Jan 08 – June 08July 08 – Dec 08Jan 09 – Jun 09Ireland6.918.059.078.72United Kingdom6.107.298.307.37The tables show that Irish energy costs, in general, tend to be above those in the UK.  This is to be expected, not least because Ireland imports over 95% of natural gas supplies from the UK and consequently faces higher transportation and interconnection charges, which also has an impact on electricity prices. Ireland also faces structural factors, including a smaller and more widely dispersed population and lack of economies of scale in electricity generation, which tend to increase energy costs in Ireland.  However, the figures also demonstrate that in two categories of electricity consumption bands, Irish electricity costs have moved below those in the UK.As well as comparative figures for Ireland and the EU, SEI's report also provides valuable insight into the drivers of higher energy costs in our market. These include our significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well as a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.  The Government is committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, and also towards ensuring diversity of energy supply to reduce our exposure to high and volatile external energy prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in place, the sale of ESB generation capacity, entry of new players and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	951	The public consultation period in respect of this foreshore licence application ended on 18 October.  Consideration of the application by my Department, in conjunction, with legal, technical and scientific advisers, is ongoing.  The final determination in the case will be made available to the public in the normal way, including by means of my Department's website. It is not possible at this stage to give a precise date for this.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	952	EC Directive 90/427/EC defines a studbook as “any book, register, file or data medium:
which is maintained either by an organization or an association officially approved or recognized by a Member State or by an official agency of the Member State concerned, andin which equidae are entered or registered with mention of all their known ascendants".Horse Sport Ireland's (HSI) Strategic Plan 2009-2012, which includes the Mission Statement that you refer to, makes specific reference to the Irish Draught breeding programme.  Horse Sport Ireland has undertaken to deliver on its mission through the adoption of various strategies and programmes with accompanying actions.  This includes a specific strategy relating to the breeding policy for the Irish Draught Horse, which is entitled "Develop a sustainable breeding policy for the Irish Draught Horse in association with Irish Draught breeders".  Furthermore, I am satisfied that the studbook, as maintained by HSI is operated in accordance with the relevant national and EU legislation.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	954	The draft legal instrument to introduce a ban on the sale of raw milk from all species for direct human consumption is at an advanced stage.  Officials from my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Health and Children with a view to implementing the ban by means of a Statutory Instrument under the Health Act of 1947 (as amended).A public consultation process was undertaken last year and resulted in the receipt of some twenty submissions from interested parties relating to the proposal to extend the ban to milk from sheep and goats.  Following examination of these submissions it was decided, with the agreement of the FSAI, that the consumption of unpasteurised milk is an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to public health and that a ban on the sale of unpasteurised milk from all species should be implemented.  Part of the process in introducing the proposed ban will involve notifying the EU Commission as required by EU Directive 98/34, which deals with the provision of information regarding technical standards and regulations.  This process will commence shortly.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme provides an integrated general education, vocational training and work experience programme for young people who have completed their Leaving Certificate and adults returning to education. The college referred to by the Deputy is an approved PLC centre. As an approved centre, it applies on an annual basis for approval of PLC courses it intends to run. There are currently no approved PLC courses of three years duration in the college referred to by the Deputy.Under the PLC Maintenance Grant Scheme, grants may only be awarded in respect of approved PLC courses. The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	956	The cost of building a new classroom or new school building will vary from project to project depending on the complexity of the project, site conditions and ultimately on the tender outcomes. I can say that recent tenders are yielding a reduction of up to 30% in overall building costs for major projects in comparison to prices at the height of the construction boom.The Planning and Building Unit of my Department is in the process of finalising the revision of the basic building cost limit per square metre for major primary and post-primary construction projects. This figure is used to set and monitor the budget for school projects as the project progresses through the design stages and to assess the value-for-money of tenders. Indications are that the new cost limit will be significantly lower than the current figure, which has been in effect since June 2006. I expect the new cost limit to be finalised and published on my Department's website shortly. Prefab rental costs are also showing a price decline and I will be in a position to provide the Deputy with comparative average rental costs for prefabs at the end of the current financial year. Because of the nature of rentals, calculations on average costs at this stage of the year will not accurately reflect comparative year-on-year costs.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	957	To date in 2009, 210 schools have been approved funding for the purchase of prefabricated classroom(s) with the option of providing a permanent solution. The latest figures available show an estimated cost of €28 million for these approvals. 61 of the approved schools have indicated to my Department that they intend purchasing prefabs and 60 intend providing a permanent solution. The remaining schools have not yet indicated their preference. Until such time as they do so it will not be possible to state how much of this year's approvals will be related to new prefabs, however I can say that it is unlikely to exceed €20 million. It is anticipated that the rental costs for 2009 will be in the region of €39 million, a saving of €14 million on the 2008 outturn, however I will be in a position to give actual detail at the end of the year.Around 830 schools are on my Department's rental list at present. In order to improve the information systems available to my Department in relation to primary and post-primary schools, my Department's Forward Planning Section uses Geographical Information System technology which contains a certain level of information on all schools in the country, at both primary and post-primary level. To further expand and improve the capabilities of the system, arrangements are being made to conduct a survey of accommodation at primary and post-primary level that will be linked to other information held in the GIS including information. Work on the development of an on-line facility for the compilation of the inventory of school accommodation is well advanced.The on-line facility will enable schools to provide information about their accommodation, including its composition in terms of permanent and temporary structures, electronically to my Department. My Department will also be collecting information on the age of existing school accommodation including both purchased and rented prefabs. It is expected that the facility will be made available to all schools to start uploading information before the end of 2009. When all the information has been received from schools, the Inventory will provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock throughout the country at both primary and post-primary levels.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	958	I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 to 255, inclusive, together.Details in relation to the school building projects which were approved to proceed to construction each year for the past five years, when they were announced to proceed and the projects which have been completed to date are currently being compiled and I will arrange for them to be forwarded to the Deputy shortly. To date in 2009, 18 major primary school projects and 7 major post primary school projects have been completed. In 2008, 77 major primary school projects and 18 major post primary school projects were completed.Total capital expenditure this year to the end of October amounts to just over €510 million on the Primary, Post-Primary and Third Level sectors. The Primary sector accounts for almost €227 million of the expenditure, the Post-Primary sector has expended €141 million and the Third Level sector accounts for almost €143 million of the expenditure. Expenditure on large scale projects was profiled for 2009 at 50% of the almost €614 million allocation for the school building programme and expenditure on devolved projects was profiled at 35% of the allocation. The exact position will only become clear at the end of the year.It should be noted that any saving in 2009 relating to the later than expected commencement on site of any major project is a deferred or delayed commitment. This commitment will now arise in 2010. The rolling multi-annual capital envelope framework allows for the carry-forward into the following year of up to 10% of the annual capital budget and my Department will be engaging with the Department of Finance in this regard. The balance of the expenditure will be accounted for on other elements of the school building programme such as the Minor Works Grant, furniture and equipment grants and the remediation programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	959	My Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme is divided into a number of component elements or sub programmes. These include Large Scale Building Projects (new school buildings and major extensions/refurbishments); Summer Works Scheme; Emergency Works; Site Acquisitions; Remediation Programmes (asbestos removal, radon mitigation); Furniture and Equipment; provision of Temporary Accommodation and the Small Schools and Permanent Accommodation Schemes. The breakdown of the 2010 funding under the various elements of the Programme including the Summer Works Scheme and my new Scheme for Water Conservation Works has not yet been determined. This will be finalised in the light of the assessment of applications received and other demands on the Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The position with regard to the 78 projects which I announced in late 2008 and early 2009 is as follows: 7 projects have reached practical completion stage, 15 projects are under construction, 31 projects are at various stages of the tendering process and 25 projects are at pre-tender stage. Of the 31 projects currently at various stages of the tendering process it is difficult to give a definitive statement as to the number of these projects which will commence on site in 2009. Delays can occur in getting clarifications on tenders, with contractors securing the necessary documentation (insurances, bond, tax clearance etc.) needed before a contract can be placed and the period of time between when a contract is awarded and when a contractor physically starts on site. Any project that does not commence in 2009 will commence in 2010, subject to all relevant matters being in order.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	961	Additional design team fees have been and are being incurred due to the change to the new form of public contract and these will be funded by my Department. As these additional fees are currently being negotiated with the relevant consultants on a case by case basis, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the amounts already agreed due to the commercial sensitivity of these negotiations. The additional fees relate primarily to the re-working of sections of the bill of quantities, specifications etc. It is anticipated that these fees will be modest in comparison to the overall fees for the projects in question. It should be noted that the post-contract design team fees on these projects will reduce substantially in line with current reduced tender levels.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	962	The project to which the Deputy refers is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget. The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.
