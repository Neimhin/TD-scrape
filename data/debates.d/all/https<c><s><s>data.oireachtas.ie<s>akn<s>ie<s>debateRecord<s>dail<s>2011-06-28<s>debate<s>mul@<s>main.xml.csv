#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	A total of 27 requests were received by my Department between 9 March and the end of May 2011, of which 19 were granted or part granted while one was refused.  A further three were withdrawn while four are being processed.  All requests received by my Department are processed statutorily by designated officials in accordance with the Freedom of Information Acts.  I have absolutely no role in processing requests.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Last week, the Taoiseach restated his determination to restore the Freedom of Information Act to its status before 2003, but he also stated he could not do this due to pressure on the Office of the Attorney General from the EU-IMF deal.  Seo geallúint eile.  Gheall an Taoiseach don phobal go bhfuil seo mar chuid den trédhearcacht, agus is léir ón bhfreagra seo nach bhfuil an Taoiseach chun cloí le geallúint a thug sé.  Is this another broken promise?  When does the Taoiseach believe this legislation will be brought forward?  He committed in the programme for Government to widen the remit of the Freedom of Information Act to other public bodies.  Could he name those other bodies?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Strictly speaking, questions on the Freedom of Information Act should be to the Minister for Finance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The programme for Government sets out the propositions from the Government parties to be implemented during the lifetime of the Government.  I have outlined several times to the House the issues surrounding a number of Bills that are on timelines, that is, Bills which must be published in accordance with the conditions and timescales of the IMF-EU bailout deal.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is examining which additional bodies might be included under the reform and restructuring of the Freedom of Information Act.  In consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, he will also examine the administrative element of the Garda Síochána that can be included under a revised Freedom of Information Act.  I have not put a date on this, but the Deputy can take it from me that the matter is being pursued.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, did you say that questions about the Freedom of Information Act should be put to the Minister for Finance?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Yes, in respect of legislation.  Individual Ministers must deal with requests for their own Department, but the legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I know it is not your fault or that of the Taoiseach, but it is difficult to get information.  I have put forward questions to the Taoiseach that have been referred to other Ministers.  It is very difficult to get information and to get a flow between the Opposition and the Government.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Deputy Adams is good at giving information.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Just ignore the backbenches for a moment.  I call on Deputy Martin.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	9	That is a favourite tactic of mine in Cork South-Central.Has the Taoiseach considered the time in which the processing of such requests is taking within his Department?  He states in his reply that four such requests are currently being processed.  The Department of Social Protection replied to a request for documents relating to the pension levy two week ago, yet a similar request to the Department of the Taoiseach is still awaiting reply, even though it was lodged at the same time.  There seems to be a certain tardiness or reluctance to provide documentation or any briefing material that his Department has received on the pension levy.  This is a very important levy, because it is reducing benefits payable to pensioners and it also puts the solvency of pension funds into question.  Perhaps he might indicate to me why that delay exists in his Department.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	10	When did the Deputy make his application for a freedom of information request?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I think it was over two weeks ago.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	12	As I said to Deputy Adams, only 27 requests were received between 9 March and 31 May 2011.  I do not have the answer to the question but I will find out.  I have no function in the statutory response to the Freedom of Information Act, nor should I.  In keeping with the efficiency of the House, Deputies should be given available information in a timely fashion.  I will query it from that perspective.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 18, inclusive, together.I was delighted to welcome President Van Rompuy to Government Buildings on Friday 17 June.  This marked his first visit to Dublin in the role he assumed in December 2009 as President of the European Council.  We had a very constructive meeting, mainly focused on the economic situation in Ireland and in the wider euro area, and on preparations for the European Council on 23-24 June.I briefed the President on the progress we are making in implementing the EU-IMF programme, including the steps we have taken on banking, the comprehensive spending review, and the jobs initiative.  President Van Rompuy expressed his full support and admiration for the efforts being undertaken in Ireland to deal with the severe challenges we face.  We reviewed the discussions underway about the interest rate reduction on our EU-funded loans, and agreed the need to find a solution.  I also took the opportunity to remind him that Ireland is looking forward to its seventh EU Presidency in the first half of 2013, and that the planning process is already well underway.Last week's European Council meeting was a busy one, with a wide range of issues on the agenda: the economic situation, including Greece; migration and asylum; and international issues, including Libya, Syria and the Middle East. I  will be making a fuller statement on its outcome to the House tomorrow.We had a good discussion on economic matters over dinner on Thursday night.  The European Council welcomed the near completion of implementing the comprehensive package of measures it agreed last March to put Europe back on the path towards sustainable and job-creating growth, including strengthened economic governance.  It welcomed in particular the agreement reached on the future European stability mechanism and the amended European financial stability facility, as well as the substantial progress made on the legislative proposals on economic governance.  It also stressed the importance of fully transparent and credible bank stress tests.The meeting concluded the first European semester, the new framework for economic policy co-ordination.  We endorsed the recommendations of the Commission for each member state, consistent with the goals of the EU2020 strategy for jobs and sustainable growth.  Member states taking part in the euro plus pact also agreed to enhance the ambition and precision of their commitments in next year's exercise.  The European Council also assessed the situation of those member states with an adjustment programme.Regarding Greece, the euro area heads agreed on a way forward and called on their Finance Ministers to complete work to allow the necessary decisions to be taken by early July.  The European Council welcomed the progress made in Ireland in the implementation of our own programme, and confirmed that this is well on track.There was no discussion of specific issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank, which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has indicated will be addressed in the autumn.  I had good conversations with a number of colleagues both at and on the margins of the meeting.  They were notably warm in their tributes to Ireland.  Through the steps that we are taking, we are establishing our credibility and this was reflected in the room.I stressed the importance of ensuring that all aspects of support programmes, including the pricing of loans, contribute to the shared goal of returning to the markets as soon as possible.  This included a constructive discussion with President Sarkozy.  He and I agreed to continue to seek a way forward together, and our officials will remain in close contact in the period ahead.  We will continue to work to find a resolution and I remain hopeful of a positive outcome.Migration and asylum issues were discussed on Friday morning, when we considered the governance of the Schengen area, the control of external borders, the development of partnerships with the countries of the southern neighbourhood and the completion of the common European asylum system by 2012.  We agreed that the accession negotiations with Croatia should be concluded by the end of June, confirming the strong commitment that exists in terms of the enlargement perspective of the western Balkans.  Discussion on developments in the southern neighbourhood included adopting a separate declaration on this subject.During the course of the discussion on international issues, I raised with colleagues concerns about the situation in Bahrain where medical staff, some of whom were trained in Ireland, face trial.  The language proposed by me on the situation in Bahrain was accepted.The European Council also finalised the appointment of Mr. Mario Draghi as President of the European Central Bank with effect from 1 November 2011.Outside the context of European Council meetings and related discussions, the position as regards my bilateral meetings with other Heads of State or Government remains as I set out to the House on 15 June.  I met with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 April, and in Dublin on 18 May; with President Obama in Dublin on 23 May; and with Prime Minister Orban of Hungary in Dublin on 1 June, in the context of the current Hungarian EU Presidency.  As I have already mentioned, I met with Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, on 17 June.  Last week, I also discussed with Prime Minister Tusk of Poland the possibility of him visiting Ireland in September.Other arrangements have not been finalised and remain under review.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Taoiseach said the European Council was warm in its attitude to Ireland.  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil an pobal ag lorg réitigh do na fadhbanna; tá muintir an Stáit faoi bhrú agus níl siad ag lorg plámáis.  The Taoiseach has told the European Union, the IMF and the European Central Bank that he will bring in €3.6 billion of cuts in the next budget.  A total of €1.5 billion of those are about the lowering of tax bands and credits as part of the general tax increases and reductions in spending, which include social expenditure reductions.  He has agreed a total of €3.6 billion in cuts, €1.5 billion in increased taxes——

What is the position?  Is it the EU or the Irish people that he is two-timing?  Did he point out at the EU summit that we cannot afford this?  Did he make it clear in terms of what is happening in our health service and what we are seeing with——

Did he bring that to the attention of the European summit?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Tá a fhios go maith ag an Teachta gur réiteach atá i gceist anseo agus sin an fáth go bhfuil na díospóireachtaí ar siúl idir oifigigh na hÉireann agus oifigigh an Aontais Eorpaigh.  Tá sin ag leanúint ar aghaidh.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin go bhfuil cúrsaí buiséid i gceist aige ó thaobh cúrsaí cánach de.  Dúirt mé go soiléir, agus tá sé i gceartlár an chláir Rialtais, nach mbeidh ardú ann sna rátaí cáin ioncaim sa chéad bhuiséad eile.  Ní bheidh laghdú sna rátaí leasa shóisialta ach dóibh siúd nach bhfuil toilteanach cúrsa traenála nó jab a ghlacadh.  Caithfidh siad a thuiscint go dtosófar le laghdú ar an ráta atá ar fáil sna cásanna sin nuair nach bhfuil siad toilteanach obair nó cúrsa traenála atá oiriúnach a ghlacadh.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Tá an Taoiseach ag rá rud amháin do na daoine san Eoraip agus rud eile do mhuintir an Stáit anseo.  Chuir mé ceist dhíreach ar an Taoiseach agus níor thug sé freagra dom.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Does the Taoiseach agree that from the report he has given today he has failed dismally in the single most prominent pledge he made to the people before the general election, in the course of the general election campaign and immediately after the general election, that he would secure a major renegotiation of the EU-IMF-ECB austerity agreement?  Does he also agree in particular that he said he would achieve burden sharing by forcing the gambling bondholders to take at least some of their own losses and that he would achieve a cut in the interest rates for funds extended from Europe at scandalously high rates?  Does the Taoiseach further agree that four months later it is abundantly clear that, despite several meetings of the European Union at the highest levels, he has absolutely nothing to show?  Will he explain to the Dáil and to the people what is going on, why he has failed so far and whether he will give a timeline for the next four months on how he will honour his promise to the people?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I hope that tomorrow morning Deputy Higgins will actively encourage people in his constituency to participate in the internship scheme which will be launched, and that he will encourage firms, employers and people in his constituency to participate in the jobs initiative which takes legal effect from 1 July.Deputy Higgins is aware that the current memorandum of understanding was renegotiated with the troika — the IMF, the EU and the ECB.  The renegotiations included the opportunity to have a limited jobs initiative to provide stimulation to the indigenous economy and to focus with particular impact on the tourism-hospitality sector where the Government reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9%, applied a zero rating to travel tax and provided temporary relief in respect of PRSI reductions for employers.Deputy Higgins is also aware that in respect of subordinated bondholders, significant amounts of money have been extracted from them and the Minister for Finance has made it perfectly clear that the circumstances surrounding senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank are in a different category to senior bondholders in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  It is the Minister's intention to raise that matter with the ECB in the autumn.In so far as the interest rate reduction is concerned, I agreed with the other leaders that the officials on our side, together with the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, will continue to carry out the remit and responsibilities which they have been given, which is to bring about a conclusion to the principle which has already been agreed of an interest rate reduction being applied to countries that are in the EFSF bailout.  From that point of view I was heartened by the response from European leaders to how the Irish people have measured up to the economic challenge, which we will beat — I hope with the help of Deputy Higgins.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I would not take a pat on the head from right wing European leaders as a source of pleasure or contentment when the reality is that the Irish people are being bled dry to save the major banks and speculators in Europe under the auspices of the leaders with whom the Taoiseach was speaking.Does the Taoiseach realise the urgency of the situation?  Bondholders are being paid all the time at different intervals.  Interest is being paid and is being ratcheted up.  The Government has lost four months.  How many more months will it lose before it obtains agreement on this issue?The Taoiseach said there was a discussion on the Middle East at the summit.  Was there a discussion on the humanitarian flotilla of urgent aid for the suffering and imprisoned people of Gaza?  Did he inform the EU leaders that the flotilla included a ship funded by the Irish people, containing a Member of the European Parliament, a councillor, a rugby player and other active and concerned individuals?  In view of the atrocity carried out by the Israeli forces on a previous flotilla ship, did the Taoiseach urge the EU states to demand safe passage for the flotilla and a commitment that the Israeli State would not attack it in either international or Gaza waters?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I am not asking the Deputy to take a pat on the head from anybody.  A number of left-wing leaders were complimentary of the efforts being made by this country and its people to deal with our challenge.With regard to the discussions about the Middle East, a detailed report was given by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, to the group, which included a response to what is happening in Libya and in Syria and the consequences for people who are fleeing to the borders of neighbouring countries.  In particular, Baroness Ashton referred to the horrendous activities on the Syrian-Turkish border when Syrian tanks were less than ten miles from that border, and the appalling and outrageous breaches of human rights which included women being lined up naked for rape.  This was a matter of serious concern to the European Council.  There was an insertion into the conclusions with regard to the movement of ships to Gaza, and Prime Minister Papandreou was particularly concerned about a number of ships which would be leaving Grecian ports to head there.  There was a general conclusion that there should be restraint.  That discussion was about what could be done to prevent what happened on the last occasion, which was of concern.  The Council did consider that matter in its deliberations on Friday morning.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Deputy Martin.  I am sorry, Deputy Higgins, but I want to give everybody a chance first.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	There are 17 questions in this group, which is a new record for the Taoiseach.  The effect of these groupings is that we are denied specific responses to specific questions.  The idea that every European issue is the same is ridiculous, and there is no basis for grouping 17 questions.  I have four questions in this group and I suggest that the Taoiseach has not answered these comprehensively enough.  I would appreciate some specific answers.The Taoiseach said there was some warmth towards Ireland.  The fundamental reason we are on track in the EU-IMF deal is the effect of the last budget, a substantial one which imposed cuts of €6 billion on the Irish people and which the Taoiseach described at the time as "savage" and voted against; however, he has now adopted it.  Provision was made for the internship scheme he just spoke about in the four-year plan, and the burning of subordinated bondholders was facilitated by legislation enacted by the late Deputy Brian Lenihan as Minister for Finance, which the Taoiseach described at the time as draconian and unconstitutional.  His capacity for policy somersaults is understood and noted.With regard to the questions I have tabled, the Taoiseach may remember that he gave a speech in London some time back in which he claimed to have had meetings with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy.  He was badly caught out on that occasion because it subsequently emerged that he had not had such meetings but was, rather, talking about meeting them at the European Council.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Sorry, Deputy, but can you put a question?  We do not want a history lesson.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I am coming to a question.  Given the huge spinning efforts concerning what happened at the Taoiseach's meeting with the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, will he tell us how long the meeting lasted?  The Taoiseach also briefed the media claiming he made a presentation on Ireland's case at the Council.  How long did this presentation take and on which part of the agenda did it take place?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I do not agree with Deputy Martin's accuracy on the number of questions being taken together.  I recall on numerous occasions over the past 20 years, how predecessors in his party would have taken substantially more than I have taken this afternoon.  I do not have an objection to these questions being divided up into sectors.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	33	It is a new record for the Taoiseach today, however.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	34	They are all related to Europe.  As I said on my first day in office, I would examine this format.  In the context of the discussions we will have in the next several weeks, I will be glad to hear Deputy Martin's opinion on whether the format needs to be changed.Deputy Martin asked me to provide an update on the outcome of discussions at last week's European Council meeting.  I have just read a four-page reply on this.  Last week, for the first time ever, we had an opportunity for the Dáil to make observations before a Council meeting.  There will be more statements tomorrow on the meeting.  If the Deputy wants me to read out the reply I have just given again, I will.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I asked two specific supplementary questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Deputy asked me to provide an update on the outcome of discussions at last week's European Council meeting for which I have just given a four-page answer.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I asked two specific supplementary questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Deputy Martin asked me to give details of discussions with the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, in recent weeks.  My discussions with him took place during the course of the European Council meeting.  As I said, we had a good conservation about the issue of the interest rate reduction.  I have detailed the bilateral contacts with the other Heads of Government.  The Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Tusk, is anxious to come to Ireland early in his term of European Presidency.  It will probably be in September if the dates are appropriate.The French President, Mr. Sarkozy, is anxious a conclusion be brought to the issue of an interest rate reduction for Ireland.  He is of the opinion that the personnel involved should continue their discussions and, hopefully, arrive at a conclusion.  I would like to have it done as quickly as possible, as everyone else does.  The German Chancellor, Ms Merkel, confirmed she is absolutely confident of Ireland beating the economic challenge it faces and that she supports our programme.I briefed the European People's Party on Ireland's position.  I made the point about the general pricing of loans and that those countries complying with their conditions should be supported.  I made the same point at the Council meeting to the general body of the 27 member states.  I also made the point that, in the event of anything untoward happening in the Grecian situation, other countries should be supported by the European Union, particularly those complying with the conditions set out in their respective EU-IMF deals.  That was clearly understood by everybody.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I asked the Taoiseach two specific supplementary questions.  First, how long did the meeting with the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, last?  It is okay if he does not want to answer it.  Second, the Taoiseach briefed the media that he made a presentation to the Council but he has just referred to one given to the European People's Party.  It seems he made none to the Council.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I said I made a presentation to the Council also.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	41	There is spin and counter-spin and there is much more spinning than there should be.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Deputy Martin should have listened to my reply.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Putting aside the academic debate on the overspinning of every development in this matter, will the Taoiseach explain to the House how the formal conclusions of the Council meeting should be viewed as progress?  The conclusions express confidence that the debts of Ireland and Portugal will be sustainable if the two countries implement their agreed programmes.  In contrast, the agreement of 11 March explicitly stated our interest rate would need to be reduced to ensure debt sustainability.  If we are saying that a reduced rate is no longer essential in the context of sustainability, then any fair person could see that our position has been weakened.  The text as agreed is, therefore, weaker than that issued on 11 March.  In the latter, all the Heads of Government agreed to change the terms and, in essence, reduce the interest rate.  Last week's text explicitly states that the existing terms will ensure or will suffice for sustainability.  Why did we agree to a text last week that is weaker than that released on 11 March?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I do not apply a stopwatch to conversations I have with people and nor did the Deputy when he was on this side.  I raised the situation in so far as Ireland is concerned at the plenary session of the Council meeting.  I stated last week that I will contribute to these debates in a comprehensive and inclusive manner and I did that.  I also spoke on the situation in the Middle East and I put forward a paragraph relating to a number of doctors who trained in Ireland and who are now subject to trial in Bahrain which was accepted by the group.  On behalf of the country and as leader of the Government, I contributed to the series of debates to which I referred earlier and which dealt with migration and asylum, the situation in Syria, Libya and other countries in the Middle East.On the interest rate reduction, no one in their right mind would expect me to attend a European Council meeting and indicate that I agree that there should be a change in Ireland's corporation tax rate.  We set that very clearly and everyone supports us.  There will be no movement in that regard.  The reason the interest rate reduction has not been passed on to Ireland is because there was a request that our corporation tax rate be increased.  The discussions taking place revolve around the consequences of Ireland not moving with regard to its corporation tax rate.  That is the position.  The Heads of Government gave responsibility in this regard to the Ministers for Finance in Brussels last March.  The officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and the Minister for Finance are continuing to work on the matter.  At leaders' level, I made it perfectly clear that we would like a quick conclusion in respect of this matter.  In that context, we are adhering to our position of no change to Ireland's corporation tax rate.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I tabled six of the questions in this group.  Two are quite general in nature, while the other four are specific.  I hope to have the opportunity to obtain clarification in respect of the latter four and also to make a couple of points regarding the Taoiseach's general response.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	46	There are only seven minutes remaining, so the Deputy should be careful that we do not run out of time.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	47	In his weekly newsletter, the Taoiseach, in the context of his experience at the European Council, stated he was very pleased in respect of the meeting at which the ESM was discussed and indicated that the latest provisions relating thereto will create a new playing field that will provide bondholders with a sense of confidence.  In discussing the debt crisis with his European counterparts, was it the Taoiseach's priority to provide bondholders with confidence?  That seems to be an extraordinary priority.  Did he discuss with his European counterparts that his and their emphasis on protecting bondholders and giving them confidence, is having disastrous consequences socially for people in this country, in Greece and other countries deeply affected by this debt crisis?  Is there any sense among our European counterparts that the programme they have put in place to deal with this crisis, in which all the emphasis relates to protecting bondholders, is resulting in terrible suffering for ordinary people?  This country faces the closure of hospital accident and emergency departments, the lack of special needs assistants for pupils in schools, the sale of State assets ——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I advise the Deputy that he is running out of time.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Were any of these issues, the social cost of prioritising bankers and bondholders, discussed or was the discussion all about providing confidence for bondholders?On the question of Greece, was there any acknowledgment that the people of Greece, who are resisting the austerity measures to pay back these bankers, may have good cause or that their resistance is now forcing a discussion about burning the bondholders to some extent?  With regard to any discussions with the Greek Prime Minister, did the Taoiseach continue with the line that Ireland is not Greece, when it is absolutely clear that any restructuring of the Greek debt will have beneficial consequences for us.  We should support the Greek people in opposing austerity.  However, I understand from the Taoiseach's response that he was insisting that the Greek people pass a further austerity budget to protect the bondholders.With regard to the Taoiseach's comments on the Gaza flotilla, was there any discussion of what was being discussed openly in the Greek papers in the past week, with regard to the IMF intervening with the Greek authorities to try and prevent some of the ships from the Gaza flotilla from leaving Greek ports?  It was suggested that the IMF was threatening to withhold moneys from the IMF deal if the Greek Government allowed ships from the Gaza flotilla to leave Greece.  Is that what the situation has come to and is that the level of what is going on at Council meetings?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Can the Deputy put his question?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Not only is the IMF dictating that we sacrifice society to pay bondholders, but we must also sacrifice the health and safety of brave people trying to bring aid and solidarity to the people of Gaza.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I must remind the Deputy that we are on Question Time.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	53	These are all questions.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The Deputy has just finished now.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Deputy has a very warped interpretation of the facts and I do not need him to put words in my mouth.  The decision with regard to dealing with preferred creditor status by the Ministers for Finance at their meeting in Luxembourg is to the benefit of every country in Europe, not just Ireland, because people who invest in a country generally buy bonds.  We did not want a situation where people investing in this country would find themselves in a long queue if anything were to go wrong.  From that point of view, the abolition of preferred creditor status is a positive step taken by the European Ministers of Finance in respect of all the countries of Europe.  The Deputy's interpretation of that is as far out as Lambay or beyond.There was quite a detailed discussion on Greece and the importance of the vote in the Greek Parliament which takes place this week, both in respect of the conditions that may apply and the range of what must be done.  There were quite a number of opinions expressed in respect of what is happening in the Greek situation.  A number of leaders spoke to Prime Minister Papandreou about the tax structure that exists in Greece and about the opportunities that exist for reform and the scale of what he and his country now face.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	56	What about the social consequences?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I suggest to the Deputy that there will be an opportunity again for discussion of the restructuring of the hospital situation, the health services and so on.I took the opportunity a number of years ago to bring a delegation from my party to Gaza and I visited the entire area to see at first hand the consequences of the destruction of buildings, etc.  I know that Deputy Martin is also one of the few who visited Gaza.  Prime Minister Papandreou informed the Council meeting that quite a number of ships wished to leave Grecian ports for Gaza.  I have no control over what the Grecian papers write, no more than over any other newspapers, and I have no idea what the Deputy is talking about in the context of the IMF fulfilling the claims made.  The issue was a concern for leaders.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Will the Taoiseach demand safe passage for the ships?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Leaders at the European Council meeting were concerned that there not be a repeat of what occurred on the last occasion.  I support that view very strongly.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Is the Taoiseach demanding safe passage for the ships?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Since the mid-1990s, the Department of Defence has been engaged in a programme of disposing of surplus properties and using the proceeds for reinvestment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The former Connolly Barracks is one such property.  I have received no proposal in regard to Connolly Barracks.  The Midland Regional Authority undertook a feasibility study into the possible use of the former barracks for a range of activities.  The acceptance and implementation of the recommendations of the Connolly Barracks feasibility study are a matter for the two local authorities that commissioned the study.  The Department has no role in this regard.I understand the local authorities are still considering the report and the challenges in providing funding for the acquisition of the barracks.  In that context, Longford County Council has expressed some interest in acquiring the barracks and discussions with the council are at a preliminary stage.  In the event of these discussions not reaching a satisfactory outcome, Connolly Barracks will be disposed of, taking account of the market conditions so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces.In the meantime, the departmental officials concerned have been in contact with the county council to determine whether a basis exists to bring the discussions to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.  These discussions will be advanced once the authorities have completed their consideration of the report.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I am accompanied by Deputy Robert Troy who has been pursuing this issue.  I understand Longford County Council is waiting for a response from the Department on its proposal.  As the Minister knows, the proposal was quite detailed.  It was for the creation of five zones of development in Longford focusing on an education centre and tourism, arts and crafts facilities.  Everybody would agree with the concept.  The Department has a role in that it owns the property in question.  Does the Minister envisage setting a deadline for the negotiations so everybody will know where he stands as soon as possible?  Given the proposal's value to the community, can it be pursued in such a way that everybody is going in the one direction?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	There is no difficulty in everybody going in one direction.  Essentially, this is a property that is available, owned by the Department of Defence and has a commercial value.  As I understand it, the feasibility study to which the Deputy referred is being considered by the local authorities and it is for them to take the initiative in the matter.  I can say to the Deputy without any difficulty that the officials in my Department will engage in and discuss the matter.  The local authorities will be aware that the study recommends the development of five zones within the barracks site for the provision of adult and further education facilities, arts, crafts and food produce initiatives, community and commercial facilities and a river park and play area.  There will be substantial costs involved in this development, and the matter is essentially one for Longford town and county councils.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The feasibility study was finalised and presented to the Department at the end of last year.  Six months later, there seems to have been a breakdown in communications somewhere.  Will the Minister ask his officials to make contact directly with Longford County Council to see whether this can be progressed so the people of Longford know what is going on?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	65	For almost three months of the six months, Deputy Calleary's party was in government and there was a degree of confusion as to who actually was the Minister of Defence because Mr. Killeen resigned and Deputy Ó Cuív was appointed and then we had a general election.I want to reiterate if constructive proposals can be implemented which are in the public interest, which address the commercial value of the barracks and which are clearly in the interest of Longford, my officials will participate in discussions to bring about such a resolution.  However, it is for the Longford authorities to come to terms with the financial implications of any arrangements that might be implemented to meet requirements in this regard.  There is no difficulty with the council dealing with matters with officials in the Department of Defence and I encourage that.  However, at the end of the day specific proposals must come from the council for the Department to consider.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	66	A wide range of goods and services is procured by the Department and the Defence Forces to ensure the Defence Forces can carry out their day-to-day roles at home and overseas.Procurement for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote.  The subheads relate to, inter alia, defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, Naval Service ships and stores, property, building and engineering, communications and information technology equipment.  There are also procurement sections in the Defence Forces with responsibility for the provision of barrack service items, utilities services and a range of food-related items.In that context I am advised a considerable amount of contracts and orders of variable values is placed for a wide range of goods and services on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis throughout the Department and the Defence Forces.  As such, I regret that I am not in a position to provide the information sought by the Deputy in my reply this afternoon.I have asked the relevant officials in my Department to collate the information required over the five-year period referred to in the question.  With the agreement of the Deputy, I propose that the information should relate to substantive contracts relative to defensive equipment acquired for core military functions with a value of €125,000, exclusive of VAT.  However, if there is a more specific sector of interest for which the Deputy may require information, perhaps he would let me know.  I will ensure the information is sent to the Deputy at the first available opportunity.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I agree to limit the request to the figure mentioned by the Minister; it probably should have been mentioned in the question.  What contracts of such a substantial value, if any, have been signed since his coming to office?  What major contracts are on hold or due to be signed in the coming months?Will he take heed of the proposal that there needs to be more ethical purchasing of military hardware or other related goods for the Defence Forces to ensure companies backed by governments in other countries, such as the case of Israel raised in the previous Dáil, and countries using illegal munitions such as cluster bombs and white phosphorus in wars against civilians or any war in which they have been declared illegal are boycotted, or that there is at least a refusal to deal with those companies while the government backing them is engaged in such activities?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I answered the second portion of the Deputy's question on the previous occasion.  It is interesting to see he returns to the one subject obsessively in the House.With regard to the query he raised in respect of contracts signed in recent weeks or which may be signed, in so far as the information is available it will be included in the information forwarded to him in written form.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	69	This was a question the answer to which we chewed over.The current contract for the supply of meat products to the Defence Forces is held by Crossgar Food Services Limited, County Down.The award of the contract in 2010 followed an open tender competition, which was advertised on the Department of Finance's e-tender website and which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The significant factor in the award of the contract at the time related to cost.  The annual value of the contract is in the region of €800,000.The contract provides for the supply of a wide range of meat products, including beef and bacon, to all major military installations.  This current contract will run to 31 December 2011.  It is expected that a new open tender competition will be advertised on the e-tenders site later this year with respect to the supply of meat in 2012 and beyond.I am advised that the meat products supplied by Crossgar Food Services Limited are traceable, fully quality assured and fully certified in all respects meeting all Irish and EU requirements.  A very significant proportion of the meat supplied by Crossgar, 90% in total, is sourced on the island of Ireland.  Predominantly all of the beef is sourced from farms in the Republic of Ireland.  This includes both the rearing of animals and the slaughtering taking place in the Republic of Ireland, with the actual processing taking place in Northern Ireland.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Defence Forces advise that the level of service provided by Crossgar Food Services Limited has been very good with meat products of excellent quality provided under the contract.The Defence Forces are obliged to carry out the procurement of food products in an open and transparent manner and in line with national and EU public procurement legislation.  The Defence Forces have absolutely no discretion in this regard.  Adherence to these rules is important, because in general the open market is of benefit to Irish producers as it provides access to markets throughout Europe.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the Minister for the information.  I will pass it on to the constituent who wanted me to find out.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I ask the Deputy to thank his constituent for smoking out that response.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	72	In 1997 agreement was reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12 years.  In 2004, PDFORRA submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994.A set of criteria was agreed to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post-1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of modern defence forces.The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis.  Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows: enlisted personnel in the rank of corporal and equivalent Naval Service rank may not serve beyond 21 years service; enlisted personnel in the rank of sergeant and equivalent Naval Service rank may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of 50 years and to the age of 56 in all higher ranks.The Permanent Defence Force like all sections of the public service is subject to a promotion and recruitment moratorium.  In order to maintain operational effectiveness limited promotion and recruitment has been sanctioned in recent times.Due to the robust nature of many military operations and their attendant physical training regimes, personnel are exposed to a unique range of challenging environments.  In these circumstances it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised.With regard to the specific question raised by the Deputy, a claim has been received from PDFORRA in relation to personnel who enlisted after 1994.  In accordance with normal procedures, the association's claim is being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to presume the manner in which these discussions may develop or to comment on any likely outcome.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Will the Minister report back to the House when the discussions are completed and indicate whether an agreement has been reached on the matter?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I have no doubt the Deputy will ask me a question to ensure the relevant information comes back to the House.  There is a specific issue here, namely, to ensure we maintain Defence Forces which have the operational capability to meet all their obligations and have an age profile which makes this possible.  Without saying any more that would in any way disrupt the discussions which will take place, this is an important issue to bear in mind, as is the history of previous negotiations and agreements that were concluded and in which PDFORRA was engaged.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Fianna Fáil Party agrees with the need to ensure the Defence Forces are fit for purpose.  The new criteria appear to be the same as the criteria currently in place.  Would it not be in everyone's interest to make this the base criterion rather than applying a rule that is no longer in use?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	76	As I stated, discussions will take place and I do not want in any way to prejudice them or impact on their outcome, nor do I want to send out any message in one direction or another.  This is an issue of some importance and I appreciate it has been raised by PDFORRA.  It is important that I ensure we have an age and operational profile in the Defence Forces which ensures they are fit for purpose and can meet their obligations overseas and at home.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Security arrangements for the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and the President of the United States were primarily an operational matter for the Garda Síochána.  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána.With regard to the two highly successful recent visits, the important role played by the Defence Forces included search, surveillance and security operations on land, at sea and in the air, as requested by and in support of the Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces were also involved in the guarding of vital installations and provision of ceremonial duties as part of Queen Elizabeth's State visit, which duties went extraordinarily well and resulted in a great deal of praise for the Defence Forces.Prior to the visits, the estimated additional cost of the Defence Forces involvement in the visit of Queen Elizabeth II was €1.18 million, while the estimated cost of President Obama's visit was €630,000.  My Department is carrying out an exercise that will confirm the accuracy or otherwise of these estimates.  At this point, the indications are that the estimated costs of both visits will not be exceeded.  The costs associated with the recent visits will be paid from the existing financial envelope provided in the defence Vote for 2011 and I am satisfied it will not be necessary to seek a Supplementary Estimate arising out of the visits.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The question was tabled because many unsuccessful attempts have been made to obtain accurate information on the overall costs to the State of the two recent State visits.  When questions were put to the Taoiseach he could only account for the cost to his Department and indicated that an estimate of the costs involved should be sought from each individual Department.  One could be forgiven for concluding that the Government does not want to reveal the true figure.  The figures provided by the Minister can now be added to those provided by other Departments.I would be pleased if some overtime was generated for members of the Defence Forces as it would soften the blow that their pay packets have taken as a result of reductions in public sector pay.  The Minister indicated his budget is sufficient to absorb the costs arising from the two unanticipated State visits.  From which part of his Department's budget will these resources be taken?The Minister also indicated that searches and surveillance were carried out at the request of the Garda Síochána.  Were searches or surveillance carried out at the request of the United States authorities?  If so, will the Minister indicate what was the cost of such activities?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Oh dear.  Some of the Members who sit in the top rows in this Chamber can never quite get away from obsessing about countries that are supposed to be the enemy — if it is not Israel, it is the United States.  No searches were carried out at the request of the United States.  Ireland is a sovereign State and the United States does not request or direct the Defence Forces or Garda Síochána to do anything of any description.  Any engagements of the Defence Forces were in the context of their assistance to the civil power and Garda Síochána.The sad reality is that a substantial amount of public money was spent on two very successful visits as a consequence of the conduct of small groups who engaged in conduct which posed a serious risk to the success of the visits and safety of our visitors.  If that had not been a concern, much of the money would have been saved.  The Department of Defence and Defence Forces operate in a very careful and efficient manner and the funding that was used in the context of the visit with regard to the Department can be dealt with in the Defence Forces Estimate without any difficulty.  It will not result in any cutback in services of any description, as provided by the Department.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  The figures he cited amount to slightly less than €2 million, a sum that cannot be ignored in the context of any Department's budget.  The relevant moneys must have been pinpointed for use in another area.  Where will the Department make up the deficit?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Deputy has just added something in the region of €800,000 on to the figure I gave, which was €1.18 million.  I do not quite see how €1.18 million comes to €2 million.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I included the Minister's figure of €600,000.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	83	In the context of the provision made available to the Department of Defence and Defence Forces, there is contained within it provision to deal with eventualities that may arise.  Such eventualities may result either from the need to address difficulties created by subversive organisations on this island or dealing with visits from persons abroad for which special security arrangements are required.  This is part and parcel of what is included in the Defence Forces Estimate.  Given that the Defence Forces and Department of Defence operate in a very efficient manner, no difficulty arises for either the Department or Defence Forces out of either visit.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I must correct the Minister.  The two figures he provided — €1.18 million and €630,000 — add up to €1.8 million, which is closer to €2 million than €1 million.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Ten military barracks have been closed since 1998.  Of the barracks closed, only four remain in the possession of the Department.  These are Magee Barracks, Kildare town, part of Connolly Barracks, Longford, Rockhill Military Post, Letterkenny, and Lifford Military Post.  Agreement in principle has been reached on the disposal of Rockhill and Lifford military posts to the local authority.  The Department wrote to all Departments in 2009 to ascertain if they or agencies under their aegis had an interest in acquiring any of the barracks that remained in its possession.  As a result, the Department of Education and Skills arranged the purchase of the old Monaghan Barracks and part of Connolly Barracks, Longford, by the respective vocational education committees.

Is it intended to transfer the ownership of the barracks to the local authority or a similar body with a view to having it put to a purposeful use, rather than having it closed at a cost to the Exchequer arising from the need to secure the site?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The site of the former Magee Barracks in Kildare town comprises, as the Deputy may know, some 64 acres.  The then Government decided on 1 July 2003 that the former barracks in Kildare would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.  On foot of this announcement, Kildare County Council prepared a local area plan for the site which encompassed a range of uses, including community activities in accordance with the commitment of July 2002.  The Department had been involved in the process of transferring ownership to Kildare County Council and the final contract of sale was sent to the solicitors for the council in 2009.  I believe I made reference to this matter on a previous occasion in the House.  However, the local authority subsequently contacted the Department to state it no longer wished to proceed with the development and did not have any interest in taking possession of the property.The property now essentially remains with the Department of Defence.  It will be disposed of by the Department, taking account of market conditions to maximise the return to the Defence Forces.  No decision has yet been made as to when steps will be taken to dispose of the site.  This is a matter to which careful consideration will be given.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Ireland is currently contributing 563 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world.  Of this, 126 are commissioned officers, 220 are non-commissioned officers and 217 are drawn from other ranks.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement which will be circulated to Deputies.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 446   personnel, the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 44 personnel, and the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo with 12 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.Also, Ireland is currently participating in the Nordic battle group, NBG, which has been on stand-by since 1 January 2011 and which will stand down on Thursday next, 30 June 2011.  The other countries contributing to the Nordic battle group are Sweden, acting as framework nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  Our contribution is a Recce/ISTAR company together with staff posts at both the operational and force headquarters amounting to approximately 150 personnel.  Recce is an abbreviation of reconnaissance; ISTAR is an acronym for intelligence, surveillance, target, acquisition and reconnaissance.As the House will be aware, personnel of the 104th infantry battalion completed their deployment to UNIFIL in the past number of days.  The Irish battalion is based in sector west of UNIFIL's area of operations, centred on the major towns of Tibnin and Bint Jubyal and the Blue Line, which separates Lebanon and Israel.  Personnel of the 104 battalion are being tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying static posts, while operating in close co-ordination and co-operation with the Lebanese armed forces.  The Defence Forces will continue to acquit themselves well and will make a vital and important contribution to the success of the mission, as they have done on so many occasions in the past.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The drawdown of the Defence Forces contingent serving with Operation ALTHEA was scheduled to occur in July 2010.  This drawdown was based on an expectation that the transition of the EUFOR mission to a training and support mission would have started by that time and having regard to the budgetary situation.  However, the mission is still undergoing transition to a smaller training and support mission and the process is not now expected to be completed until the end of 2011.  The Defence Forces contribution will be reduced from the current level of 44 personnel to seven personnel at the end of the current rotation of the Irish contingent next month.The drawdown of Irish personnel from KFOR in Kosovo from around 230 personnel to a residual component of 12 personnel took place between April and October 2010.  Today, the Government approved continued Defence Forces participation by up to 12 personnel in KFOR and seven personnel in the UN authorised International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, ISAF, for a further period, beyond June and July 2011 respectively.  Also at its meeting today, the Government approved continued participation in the EU Common Security and Defence Policy military mission to contribute to the training of Somali security forces, for a further period of one year beyond August 2011, subject to an appropriate decision of the Council of the European Union authorising the extension of the mission.TotalOfficersNCOsPtes1.UN Missions(i)UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) HQ9540UNIFIL 104 Infantry Battalion43752168217(ii)UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) — Israel, Syria and Lebanon111100(iii)MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)3300(iv)MONUSCO (United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo)3300(v)UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast2200Total46576172217UN Mandated Missions(vi)EUFOR (EU-Led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)449350(vii)EUTM Somalia (EU-led Training Mission in Uganda)2200(viii)KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo) — HQ12570(ix)ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)7430Total with UN Missions530962172172.Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)(i)OSCE Mission to Bosnia & Herzegovina2200(ii)OSCE Mission in Belgrade — Serbia1100(iii)Staff Office, High Level Planning Group, Vienna1100Total44003.EU Military StaffBrussels65104.Nordic Battlegroup HQ Staff — Sweden1311205.Military Representatives/Advisers/Staff(i)Military Adviser, Permanent Mission to UN, New York1100(ii)Military Adviser, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna1100(iii)Staff Appointments, Irish Delegation to OSCE, Vienna1100(iv)Military Representative to EU (Brussels)4400(v)Liaison Office of Ireland, NATO/PfP (Brussels)2200(vi)Military Representative to NATO/PfP Co-ordination Cell/Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), Mons, Belgium1100Total  Serving  Overseas563126220217

I join the Minister in wishing the personnel deploying to Lebanon health and success, and I wish their families well.  They follow in a very fine tradition.Overseas service is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces in terms of the experience it gives them.  Is the Minister happy that the balance serving overseas at present between general service, non-commissioned officers, NCOs, and commissioned officers reflects the overall balance of the Defence Forces?  Troops are broadly expected to serve one six month tour every three years.  Is that ratio still in place?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	90	It is at present.  Like the Deputy, I wish our troops well in southern Lebanon.  We discussed this issue at some length a few days ago in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The troops are performing a very important task in a fraught part of the world.  As I said at the committee, I am committed to continuing the involvement of our troops in overseas missions.  I anticipate that the troops who are going to Lebanon will return in December, when another contingent will go there to be joined by the Finnish troops who are also part of this deployment.

Are any of them participating in operations such as dealing with improvised explosive devices, IEDs, or working in combat zones?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Seven members of the Defence Forces are based in Afghanistan.  They are largely engaged in administrative functions but they have also been engaged in training other personnel in the neutralisation of improvised explosive devices, an area in which our Defence Forces have particular expertise.  Their involvement in that area has saved lives and has been greatly valued in terms of the skill they bring to that task.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	93	With regard to the UN management of our forces, did the Minister see the remarks made by Colonel Gerald Aherne in "SIGNAL" magazine last week?  Colonel Aherne was the chief of operations on the UN peace enforcement mission in Liberia.  He spoke about UN office politics negatively affecting military missions and said that UN structures were beset by a muddled chain of command.  He also said that during the most recent mission in central Africa vital "life support issues" for soldiers were unsatisfactory.  Did the Minister see those remarks and what is his response to them?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	94	There are a number of overseas missions.  Would the Minister consider putting a motion before the Dáil annually to give authorisation to those which do not amount to 14, the figure that requires authorisation under the triple lock mechanism?  Soldiers are stationed in Afghanistan, NATO headquarters and at the UN.  Could an omnibus motion be put to the House annually to give authorisation to the number of soldiers serving overseas?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	95	On the matter raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, there is adequate opportunity at meetings of the defence committee to discuss the very small contingents of the Defence Forces who go abroad on various missions.  There is no need for the time of the House to be taken up in circumstances where perhaps one or two members of the Defence Forces are participating in a UN organised mission abroad.  The numbers are too small and there is absolute transparency in arrangements of that nature.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is the appropriate structure within which to discuss them.I read Colonel Ahern's article.  That mission occurred prior to my appointment as Minister for Defence but there were matters referred to in respect of members of our Defence Forces which give rise to concern.  I had an interest in the defence area and certain difficulties did arise in the course of that mission.  I am aware from reading general materials, although not as Minister for Defence at the time, that there were suggestions of some difficulties.  It is vital that there is a co-ordinated command structure for any UN mission and that there is full co-operation between the different forces located in an area.  We have a particular interest in ensuring that and I will do what I can, as Minister for Defence, to ensure difficulties of the type described do not recur in any mission in which our forces are engaged.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 56 together.The Naval Service assists the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, in promoting compliance with and deterring contraventions of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The SFPA liaises regularly with the Naval Service and, inter alia, the Fisheries Monitoring Centre, FMC, and the Air Corps.To achieve strict compliance with quota and other conservation legislation under the Common Fisheries Policy, Naval Service targeted boardings and inspections are agreed between the SFPA and the Naval Service.  Boardings are targeted based on the risk analysis carried out by the FMC.  The criteria examined for the risk analysis would include the fishing vessel's date of last offence, the date of last gear inspection, the number of days fishing in Irish waters, the species targeted and the method of fishing.In 2010, the Naval Service carried out 1,684 boardings at sea of vessels of various nationalities, with eight fishing vessels detained.  Statistics up to the end of May for this year show the Naval Service has carried out 560 boardings and has detained three vessels.  Further details relating to the vessels boarded and their country of origin are contained in tabular statements which I propose to circulate with this reply.NationalityJan2010Feb2010Mar 2010Apr 2010May 2010Jun 2010Jul 2010Aug 2010Sep 2010Oct 2010Nov 2010Dec 2010TotalIrish1008458447211158111106253720826Spanish12222058282016957059831439UK1486181723813211139151French13191525172594121775204Belgian13041220010317German2000100010026Netherlands32072000001318Russian0050000000005Norwegian0100000010002Faroes0020000000002Portugal0100101100004Denmark2200000112008Iceland0010000010002Total1471421071561391819426222210556731,684NationalityJan 2010Feb 2010Mar 2010Apr 2010May 2010Jun 2010Jul 2010Aug 2010Sep 2010Oct 2010Nov 2010Dec 2010TotalIrish0000001200003Spanish1001000100003UK1000001000002Total2001002300008NationalityJan 2011Feb 2011Mar 2011Apr 2011May 20112011TotalIrish6435722613210Spanish1224732719155UK14152171269French15122917982Belgian210014German602109Netherlands6383020Russian009009Norwegian001001Faroes000000Portugal000000Denmark000000Iceland001001Total119902168154560NationalityJan 2011Feb 2011Mar 2011Apr 2011May 2011TotalIrish001001Spanish100001UK001001Total102003
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I thank the Minister for his response.  I acknowledge with gratitude the work of the Naval Service in protecting our fish stocks in difficult conditions on the high seas.Can the Minister comment on the electronic logbook, which I understand is a contentious issue at present?  Has the Naval Service access to records recorded through the electronic logbook and held in the country of origin of the vessel being inspected or detained?  Has the Minister information pertaining to difficulties arising from vessels having neither the electronic logbook nor paper logbooks?  How can that difficulty be surmounted?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	98	As the Deputy knows, EU Regulation 2807 of 1983 required all EU vessels to retain a paper logbook on board.  This was required to be completed every 24 hours.  A new control regulation, EU Regulation 1224 of 2009, which was introduced on 7 May 2011, legislates for the introduction of electronic reporting and recording systems.  Article 15 of this regulation states that all masters of community fishing vessels of 12 m length overall or more shall record information by electronic means and shall send it by electronic means to the competent authority of the flag member state at least once a day.  This requirement negates the obligation to complete a paper logbook.The electronic recording system, ERS, project is running well behind schedule in almost all member states.  An additional complication is that all member states are at varying levels of development of the system.  For the system to work, all states need to go live at the same time and be at the same level of development.  Ireland has completed fitting electronic logbooks on all vessels over 24 m, this being the first of three categories required.  Other works have been completed on the recording systems in the Fisheries Monitoring Centre, FMC, and on inspection devices.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Is the Minister aware of instances where the electronic logbook was not available to the Naval Service or fishery protection officers in this country and neither was a paper log available?  Has he brought this to the attention of his colleagues in the Cabinet or of the Commission, which I understand is responsible for ensuring this does not happen?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I presume the Deputy is talking about an incident that occurred on 10 June last, when the Naval Service vessel, LE Niamh, boarded and detained two Spanish registered fishing vessels for alleged breaches of fishing regulations approximately 30 miles south of Castletownbere.Some Spanish vessels have been fitted with electronic logbooks.  However, following this recent incident, the FMC has, on three occasions, requested the Spanish authorities to provide a list of the Spanish vessels that are operating the logbook system in advance of full implementation of the ERS.  While this list has not yet been provided, the Spanish authorities have provided the FMC with a copy of the catches which were electronically sent to them by the two detained Spanish vessels.  With regard to the incident of 10 June, it is now a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether charges should be pressed.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Minister has touched slightly on the subject of my question.  I notice the nationality of ships boarded is not included as a targeting measure.  Are we precluded from doing this and is it something that should be looked at?  Is there a predominance of nationalities among ships boarded and where offences are found, and are those figures available?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The list will be attached to my reply to Deputy Stanton's question.  The list of fishing vessels boarded covers a range of countries.  A substantial number of Irish vessels have been checked over the years.  Of the non-Irish fishing vessels boarded by the Naval Service in 2010, some 439 were Spanish.  While the Naval Service cannot target a country, it can have regard to the records of particular ships and boats and can make considered decisions, based on their location and conduct, as to whether a boarding is appropriate.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I compliment the Naval Service on the very professional work it carries out.  The Minister referred to liaison between the FMC, the Naval Service and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  Who takes the lead in those consultations and who makes the decisions?  Who makes operational decisions on individual operations?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Naval Service assists the SFPA in promoting compliance and the SFPA liaises regularly with the Naval Service and the FMC.  There is continual interaction between the services, which can result in the Naval Service making a decision that it is appropriate to intervene with a particular vessel.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	105	With regard to the incident referred to, does the Minister think it acceptable that there should be difficulty in exchanging information with the Spanish authorities?  In trying to manage and police the fishing resources off our cost, is it acceptable that we should have difficulty in receiving information from the authorities of another member state?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I would hope that there would be co-operation between EU member states and that information sought would be provided without difficulty.  The information on both these vessels was, ultimately, provided and no issue now arises.  However, a substantial number of boardings of Spanish vessels has occurred.  In 2010, there were 204 boardings of French vessels and 151 boardings of UK vessels.The fact that a vessel is boarded does not necessarily mean that illegality is detected when it is boarded.  This is all part of a process to protect our fisheries and to ensure that people are complying with the law.  There have been a disproportionate number of boardings of Spanish ships.  I would hope that difficulties that arise in this area would be resolved.  If the new electronic recording is not available, I would hope that paper records would be available.  It is not satisfactory that neither be immediately available to the Naval Service when sought.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	107	In the incident outlined by the Minister, is it the case that neither set of records was available on the night in question, that the ships were allowed sail and that the Irish authorities were unable to inspect either a paper or electronic logbook?  Is it intended that the electronic logbook will be available online for inspection by the Irish authorities?  When will that happen?  In the interim, can the Minister ensure that the paper logbook is provided if the other information is not?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Clearly, the paper logbook should be provided if the other information is not.  It is not satisfactory that neither form of information is readily available.  There is, clearly, a timeframe for implementing the EU arrangements for the electronic recording of information.  In that regard, there are areas we ourselves must deal with.  We have to be temperate in our language about these things.It is important that the information that lawfully should be available is available when it is sought and that it should not be a matter of difficulty.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 55 together.In accordance with the terms of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, the fifth annual report of the Ombudsman was laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 21 June 2011.  The report shows a welcome drop in the number of complaints currently lodged with the Ombudsman, down from 229 in 2008 to 116 in 2010.The Ombudsman's report notes that there were delays in 2010 in responding to the final reports of the Ombudsman with 19 cases awaiting attention at the end of the year.  I am advised that the delay was largely due to the complexity of the complaints and competing priorities within the unit dealing with the reports.  However, I am pleased to confirm that a final determination has been issued to the Ombudsman in respect of all these outstanding cases.  I engaged when appointed Minister in ensuring that the cases that had accumulated and needed to be dealt with were addressed with some speed and I am confident that final reports submitted by the Ombudsman during 2011 will be considered within the earliest timeframe.  In that regard, procedures to prioritise the processing of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces final reports have been put in place by both the Defence Forces and the Department.Since the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman in 2005, a number of human resource procedures have been reviewed and revised following recommendations from the Ombudsman in her final reports, for example, the selection processes for career courses and overseas service.  In addition, the recommendations of the Ombudsman have informed the development of a new promotions scheme, which is near finalisation, as part of the commitments under the Croke Park agreement.  Almost 50% of all complaints arise from administrative issues in the promotion system and the new scheme is designed to resolve these issues.  A standing committee on human resource issues also reviews the implementation of systemic recommendations from the Ombudsman on a monthly basis.  While dealing with the individual grievances referred to in her reports, the reports are also used to inform the ongoing development of best practice in human resource management for the Defence Forces.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I welcome the proposal regarding the new promotions scheme.  When does the Minister expect that to be implemented?  Even though the scheme has not been finalised, I presume there is an indicative timeframe.  As he mentioned, a substantial number of the complaints recorded relate to promotions.The Ombudsman referred in her report to the slowness of ministerial responses to proposals in previous reports.  While that is not the current Minister's responsibility, will the proposals in her latest final report be addressed with greater urgency over the next year or so?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I regard it as important that the conclusions of the Ombudsman are taken seriously, that they are reflected upon in the manner in which the legislation envisages and that, ultimately, a decision is made by the Minister as to whether to fully implement recommendations made or whether circumstances arise, which create a difficulty in that regard.  I paid particular regard to the outstanding reports from the Ombudsman which I discovered existed when I took office.  I am committed to ensuring where individual members of the Defence Forces have a grievance, which results in a request by them for the Ombudsman's intervention, that following the Ombudsman completing that process, the role that the Minister is required by statute to play is played with reasonable speed and that decisions are made.With regard to the timeframe for the new promotions system, I expect that will be in place relatively shortly.  I do not want to give an absolute date but it will be done within a short time.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This relates again to security arrangements of the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama.  They were primarily a matter for the Garda.  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, An Garda Síochána.With regard to these successful visits, the roles played by the Defence Forces included search, surveillance, security operations, etc., and guarding vital installations.  This question should have been taken with the earlier question because the same information is being provided.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The same series of parliamentary questions have been tabled to elicit information regarding the costs incurred by local authorities, the Garda and the Defence Forces for these visits.  Both visits went off well and they were worthwhile.  I, therefore, did not table the question from the point of view of opposing the visits.  However, I do not see how they could be self-financing.  It may well be that when budgets were put together, an instruction issued to capture what might have been the cost.  Several Members have tabled the same questions and this is repetitive work for someone.  It would be worthwhile, therefore, if a composite response issued to save us from asking these questions.  That would be useful and account should be taken of these costs when future visits are timetabled in order that we can budget for them appropriately.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I thank the Deputy for her question, although it is starting to feel like ground-hog day.  Her colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, asked the same question earlier.  Such visits involve different Departments and agencies.  In the context of security issues, the Garda was the lead agency engaged to provide the security necessary and it is estimated the additional cost to the force will not be less than €20 million.In the context of the Defence Forces' engagement in providing both security and protection at the request of the Garda and engaging in ceremonial duties, the cost of Queen Elizabeth's visit is estimated to be €1.18 million while they incurred costs of approximately €600,000 for President Obama's visit.  A backward look at the costs incurred is under way but that will take time and until that is complete, we will not have the final figures.  Members are enthusiastically tabling parliamentary questions to elicit information as rapidly as possible but at this stage, most of the figures are relatively clear.  I know there is some finality to be brought to the figures for the Garda Síochána.  We will know the final figures by the end of this week, which is the end of June.  The same applies to the Defence Forces.

In comparison to other Departments and other agencies, they are a model of efficiency.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	116	In fairness to both, the Garda involvement was a great deal more intensive and required a great deal more personnel, overtime and allowances for the many members of the force who were engaged to be collated.  That is more complex when compared with the Defence Forces, where the financial backdrop is simpler and clearer.  Both forces did us proud during the course of both visits.  We should take great pride in their performance.  We should take great pride in the fact that both visits went so well.  Given the possibility of visits by other dignitaries in the future, or even by the Queen and President Obama again, it is important to state that if there were not a small group of malcontents intent on disrupting the visits and on spoiling the enjoyment of many people in Dublin who would like to have had greater engagement with our visitors, a great deal of this money would have been saved and could have been used for other purposes.  In circumstances of financial stringency, I think that is worth repeating.  If there is a similar visit on future occasions, I hope there will not be the level of threat from these groups, which existed during the course of these visits, that requires this level of intense security.

The advantage of this approach is that the professionals, who deal with a particular sector on a daily basis, can bring their skills and expertise to bear and they can quickly identify who is best placed to provide support in an emergency situation.  It is the model that is followed in many countries.At a national level, the Government task force on emergency planning provides strategic direction and co-ordination of emergency planning.  The task force, which I chair, was established after the 11 September 2001 attacks and is comprised of Ministers and/or senior officials from all Departments and key public bodies.The task force provides a forum for keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Departments and it examines cross-cutting issues that impact across the Government.  It is a forum for sharing information and, from time to time, experts are invited to make presentations to the task force on any emerging emergency planning issues.  Regarding the streamlining of emergency planning, there is a constant review of emergency structures, practices and procedures to ensure lessons learned from emergency responses are implemented and that there is an ongoing improvement in our response to emergencies.The Office of Emergency Planning is a joint civil-military office with a staff complement of five.  The office is located at my Department's headquarters in Newbridge.  The National Emergency Co-ordination Centre is located in Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin.  Staff are assigned and based in the National Emergency Coordination Centre during emergency activations and as required for other activities held there.

We know the Garda Síochána and the ambulance services are using the Tetra system at the moment, but I do not think the Defence Forces do so.  This does not just deal with communications, but also vehicles and so on.  Is that taken into account for procurement purposes by all those agencies?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Communications play a vital part of the response to emergencies that arise, especially communications between the different agencies in the State.  This issue is kept under review by the task force, and I will ensure it is continually reviewed.  One can always improve communications, but further developments in these areas are constrained by our economic circumstances.During the course of the two recent visits, both the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána showed how well they interact and communicate with each other on matters of high security.  I have the greatest confidence in their ability to do so in the case of any emergency that may arise and which would require a joint response from both.  The ambulance services and the Garda Síochána are operating on the Tetra system and there is a fully co-ordinated communications network operating between them.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Earlier this year, the deputy leader of Fine Gael wrote a series of public letters, giving direct guarantees concerning services in hospitals throughout the country.  I have one such letter from February, which is an open letter from Deputy James Reilly to the people of Roscommon.  He stated that "Fine Gael undertakes to retain the emergency surgical, medical and other health services at Roscommon Hospital."  On 22 March, Deputy Naughten — Fine Gael's new chairman of the Oireachtas health committee — announced that the party had firmly "put a halt to any plans by the HSE to withdraw services from smaller hospitals", and that would not only protect, but would enhance and develop these services.In yesterday's visit to Roscommon to open Deputy Naughten's local office, the Taoiseach told concerned families and local media that while there may be changes, the future of the hospital was secure.  However, it has been revealed today that arrangements are being made to end all emergency admissions and convert Roscommon County Hospital into a basic day-case facility.  This process is due to start in a few weeks.

Why are crystal clear commitments, made only a few months ago, now being abandoned?  Why did the Taoiseach personally claim yesterday that the future of Roscommon County Hospital is secure, when the evidence shows this is not true?

We have always held the view that small hospitals have a real future in a restructured and revamped health system, and Roscommon is no different from that.  HIQA has stated it is unsafe to continue the accident and emergency unit in its current form.  For that reason, compounded by the difficulties in recruiting non-consultant hospital doctors, this system will change after 11 July.  There are several implications arising from this, which the Minister for Health has set out.The Government's priority on acute hospitals is to ensure there is safe, high quality care for patients, provided at the most appropriate location.  As the Deputy knows, there is not 24 hour cover for anaesthetics in Roscommon and the medical evidence now available is that trauma patients being attended to by paramedics on site and then transferred to a high volume hospital have an increased chance of living, which is the major consideration for every person here.  Those are the reasons.

The Taoiseach had complete knowledge of all of that before the election, as did the Minister for Health.  He was fully aware of the facts but the Taoiseach made those promises to Roscommon and to other hospitals throughout the country and he should explain now why he is breaking them.  His colleague, the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Naughten, launched his election campaign by telling the community that a Fine Gael Government would take Roscommon Hospital off the political agenda once and for all.

Why did he and the Minister for Health make those clear promises?  In advance of the election as Opposition spokesman, the Minister for Health wrote to the clinical director of operations in the HSE and told him to stop the configuration plans because he would be Minister in a month and would sort this out.  That might have appeared a great political stroke at the time but why did he make those promises?  Why did he reassure people about the future of Roscommon Hospital when he knew it was about to be closed as an accident and emergency facility?

This morning, however, we heard Bord Gáis paid €1.9 million in bonuses last year, while the Dublin Airport Authority paid €2.1 million, exactly the amount needed to reverse the cutbacks this Government will impose on rural school transport schemes, which will affect people across the State.Other semi-State bodies, such as Bord na Móna, the Irish Aviation Authority and An Post, also paid bonuses but they will not tell us how much.  These are State-owned companies and there is incredible anger, as the Taoiseach saw in Roscommon, and it exists from Sligo to Drogheda, but these companies are paying millions of taxpayers' money in bonus payments and big pensions, not on Fianna Fáil's watch but on the Taoiseach's watch.  The Minister for Finance was quick to bring in legislation to increase the pension age for ordinary workers.  What steps will he take to end the abuse of the bonus culture in these State companies?  How much did Bord na Móna, the Irish Aviation Authority and An Post pay out in bonuses?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I cannot answer that question because I do not have that information.  The Government has made it perfectly clear that it expects leadership from the top when it comes to adjusting to the economic reality.  People will be asked to make further sacrifices and in that context we must have a situation where leadership comes from the front.  There cannot be a situation where large bonuses are paid to State CEOs when serious adjustments must be made to the economy.  The Government has set that out clearly, and we have clearly said that no bonuses should be paid to people who are already very well paid to do a particular job.Last week the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform set out the pay ceilings for CEOs of commercial semi-State bodies and the wider public sector.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources wrote to the chairman of each State company on 13 May, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, stating he is firmly of the view that bonuses are inappropriate and that payments should cease immediately.  He instructed civil servants attending remuneration committees to reaffirm this position clearly and he asked the chairman of each body to copy his letter to the full board and the board to provide confirmation that payments would cease immediately.  Following the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport's comments, the DAA board will comply with Government wishes.So far, not all of the chairmen have replied to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources but RTE, TG4, ESB, OSI and An Post responded that no further bonus payments will be made and he expects the other three bodies, Eirgrid, Bord Gáis and Bord na Móna, will confirm the same position shortly.  In those cases formal confirmation may be necessary by the relevant remuneration committees and their boards.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will continue to engage on any outstanding issues and will reaffirm the position that in the current financial circumstances, performance-related bonuses are utterly inappropriate and his clear position is that no bonus payments should be made.  In saying this, he has been equally clear this position is no reflection on the performance of any individual but a necessary measure in the light of current economic circumstances.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is not good enough that the Minister should send "Dear John" letters to the semi-State bodies.  As the Taoiseach knows, deep suffering is being caused by the awful bailout deal the Government has bought into for every cent.  He has yet to secure a cut in interest rates while the Minister for Finance is reduced to imploring people to go shopping.  I do not know if he understands how offensive that is to those who do not have any money.We are looking for a commitment that the Government will bring forward legislation to stop the bonus culture.  I said to the Taoiseach before that this could be done very quickly.  The Labour Party Members should bow their heads in shame when it affects the small people in this State.  The Taoiseach cannot give us a clear indication of the number of bonuses that have been paid out by these semi-State companies.  Does he intend to bring forward legislation to stop that?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Government has made perfectly clear its view about bonus payments.  People in these positions are very well paid to do a job.  Bonus payments are inappropriate, and the Government has made that statement very clearly.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, was informing the chairs of the boards officially by letter to ensure there would be under no misunderstanding about what is involved in respect of bonuses.  What the Minister, Deputy Noonan, pointed out is in the context of what the Government is doing in this respect, which is making decisions that will enable us to be in charge again of our own economic affairs and deal with the underlying problems in the Irish economy, make decisions about the banks and about creating a jobs stimulus and a jobs initiative, and deal with finding out the truth of the scale of what must be done in respect of closing this country's deficit.People throughout Ireland want this issue to be concluded, and every one of them is prepared to contribute.  In that sense they want to see that there is fairness in the system.  The Government is setting out its position in so far as fairness is concerned where exceptionally large bonuses have been paid to well-paid people while at the other end of the scale it has had to resort to renegotiating the troika agreement to reverse the cut in the minimum wage brought about by the previous Government affecting the lowest paid workers in our society.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I too welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to eyeball the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, over the weekend and the successful way he has forced it to back down in this situation.  However, the Taoiseach should recognise that one victory of this sort does not sort out the problem.  The semi-State sector has gone walkabout for many years, which predates his tenure in power, and we need a lot more than one victory.  What Deputy Adams referred to as the bonus culture is eking out by the day as the annual reports are coming out that other semi-State companies are intending to pay similar bonuses.  That is unacceptable.When we look at the DAA we see a real example of abuse of power and a semi-State body having detached itself from the Government.  We must consider the fact that this man, Mr. Collier, was being awarded a bonus of €100,000 in the same year that junior staff on €30,000 were being forced to take a cut in pay.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	165	We are over time, Deputy.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Is it not absurd that somebody who is involved in a controversy of this sort for his own remuneration should be deciding on the remuneration of those in the banks for which the State has responsibility?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Deputy has made the case eloquently in respect of overstepping the mark, in my view, by semi-States and their boards in the case of bonus payments.  I agree with that, and that is the reason the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has already set out his intention to initiate a review of the current performance related awards scheme for chief executive officers of commercial State companies and in the interim the boards have been requested not to pay bonuses.I find it beyond any normal common sense that persons who are exceptionally well paid are paid bonuses for performance beyond that.  These things should not apply in my view, and in the context of where we are as an economy and as a society the point the Deputy makes in respect of lower paid workers is patently obvious.The Deputy can take it that the review which is now being set out by the Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, will examine the system of performance related award schemes for CEOs and in conjunction with other Ministers where semi-State companies apply, will consider more direct input and oversight by Ministers to ensure this situation does not continue to apply.  I do not know what authority the Minister for Finance has in respect of any other appointments beyond CEO of the semi-State body the Deputy mentions.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	168	If the Taoiseach will not give a commitment about any immediate changes, and I believe he should fulfil a commitment the Government made earlier to sack virtually all the boards of every quango because of the political appointees and the nature of them, could he comment on the appropriateness of someone like Mr. Collier who is involved in this remuneration controversy being a public interest director in charge of remuneration on the board of a State owned bank?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I find it not good practice.  I do not want to appear to be in any way vindictive about this but in my view we cannot have a situation such as the one the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was confronted with last week which was resolved.  I also accept that this should not be seen as some sort of individual incident of victory.  Everybody in the country, from the highest person down, must understand that we face a challenging time as a country, and we are meeting that challenge, but the message does not seem to have got through to some people yet.  I hope the Deputy's own contribution is helpful in getting that message through to them directly.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 9, 10 and 11 agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business agreed to?  Agreed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Can the Taoiseach explain where all the Labour Party senior Ministers are?  I hope there has not been some row that we are unaware of at Cabinet.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	174	That is not a matter for the Order of Business, Deputy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	179	This is very serious.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	182	In October there are supposed to be three constitutional referenda.  The constitutional convention to recommend further amendments is due to be up and running.  In spite of the Taoiseach's repeated promises, there has been no attempt to consult with the Opposition about those measures.  He has consistently refused to give specific dates for when the consultations will take place.  Will the Taoiseach give a specific date on which the consultations, which preceded all recent referenda, will be held?  Could he explain the timetable within which he proposes to allow the Dáil to consider the legislation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Deputy Martin has raised the matter on a number of occasions.  The Opposition will be consulted fully and properly.  Deputy Martin is well aware of the process.  When a decision is made by Government to hold a referendum, a Bill must be drawn up and published.  The Opposition will be consulted in due course.  I cannot give the precise date or the hour on which the consultation will take place but Deputy Martin can take it from me that the Opposition will not be neglected in terms of having an opportunity to give its view on the proposals for the referenda.  There will be an opportunity for further discussion in the House as well.  We are aware of the timescale and the dates by which legislation must be passed.  Deputy Martin should trust me on this one.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I asked about the matter last week and the Taoiseach indicated that he would consult with the Opposition in advance of the publication of the Bills on the forthcoming proposals.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Taoiseach has answered the Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	190	We are aware of the timescale, which is getting very tight in terms of the commission that must be established in advance of a referendum being held.  We are talking about three referenda and explanatory memoranda.  At this stage the Government should be in a position at least to have a preliminary consultation with the Opposition parties on the proposed three referenda.  If it does not happen before the summer recess then the Government is in significant difficulty given that its position has always been that we should have more time for referendum commissions than was the case in the past.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Could we finalise the matter?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	193	A statement was promised by the Taoiseach from the Minister for Health three weeks ago.  He was to report back on the crisis arising from the junior doctors debacle.  We have still no notion of when that statement might be made.The Taoiseach might have noted that I welcomed the Government's commitment to look positively on the obligations of the Irish and British Governments to examine the report published yesterday by the human rights institutions in Belfast and Dublin in which they argued for a single human rights charter for the island of Ireland.  Sinn Féin welcomes that.  It was part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  Will the Government allow time for a debate on the issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The recruitment of hospital doctors is not yet concluded.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The report has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The next issue is one I wish to address to the Ceann Comhairle.  I raised an issue in the House which was on the Minister's desk on the very first day he came into office, that there would be up to 400 junior doctor vacancies with a subsequent roll-on in hospitals.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am sorry but the Deputy cannot debate the matter now.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Taoiseach did not know about that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I am sorry but this is not a matter on the Order of Business.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I am sorry.  I will only be a second.  The Taoiseach said that the Minister would come to the House to address the issue, which was fair enough.  The Minister has still not done that.  In the interests of citizens, how does a Member try to get such information dealt with properly?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	201	There are a number of ways.  The Deputy can raise it on the Adjournment, on Leaders' Questions——
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I have done all that.

Deputy Adams can take it that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will be happy to give the information to the House when accurate information is available.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Deputy Adams is aware of the recruitment process that took place for non-consultant hospital doctors and the response to that.  It is only right and proper in the interests of the health service and those who work within it that the Minister would be able to provide accurate information to the House when he reports, which he will do.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I understand that.

It is urgently required for a sector that is in freefall but a number of defects have been identified.  When will it come back to the Dáil?  Will it come as a Private Members' Bill or will it be redrafted as a Government Bill?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Are there no Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meetings?

I understand that the Government is continuing to get advice from the Attorney General.  On "The Week in Politics" the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, confirmed that is the case, but it is the view at this stage that a referendum will not be necessary.  It is time to publish the advice the Government is getting from the Attorney General.  I have done what the Ceann Comhairle advised.  I submitted a written question and I was told there are difficulties.  In the public interest I call on the Taoiseach to publish the advice from the Attorney General.  Why will the Government not put this urgent matter before the people?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Deputy, you know there are many ways you can do this — through parliamentary questions, Private Members' time or an Adjournment debate.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	246	There is a massive queue for those, a Cheann Comhairle.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	248	No.  The Deputy has a Whip and the Whip should deal with it in the normal way.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	249	We raised it at every meeting, a Cheann Comhairle.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Well, you should raise it again.  I am sorry; I am moving on.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I appreciate that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	261	It would be incomplete——

I cannot see any legislation in this regard.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	268	If the Deputy goes down to the Library the staff will help him.  They have a very good service down there.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	270	It is not up to the Taoiseach to come in here and advise the Deputy on these issues.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	271	If the Ceann Comhairle will let me finish, I will do so.  Is the Government preparing to introduce legislation to define small rural hospitals?  My understanding is that the hospitals that will be closing or losing their accident and emergency services are actually quite large, urban hospitals that provide many services.  Secondly——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Deputy is out of order.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The Deputy should follow the example of his leader, who actually sits down when I ask him.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	277	EUROSTAT figures released today show that Irish consumer prices are 18% above the European average, with food prices 20% above average——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	278	What legislation are we talking about?

This is all happening in the context of cuts.  What legislation does the Government intend to introduce to help support small businesses so they can reduce their prices, particularly in the area of food?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	280	The Deputy is out of order again.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Deputy is going from Billy to Jack.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Will the Taoiseach answer the question that is in order, please?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I cannot give the Deputy a date for the legislation on upward-only rent reviews.  That is a matter that is being worked on at the moment.  Decisions made by clinicians in hospitals do not generally require legislation, whether the hospital is small or big.With regard to the blather raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett last Wednesday, when he objected to the guillotining of Bills in the House, the Dáil was suspended for two hours because the Deputy's group did not have sufficient speakers on the Finance Bill.

He will be aware of the scenario that unfolded in the Rostrevor nursing home, in which nurses came forward and co-operated fully with HIQA, jeopardising their own livelihoods — in this instance, they were migrant workers.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	307	There is no need to expand.

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the danger of a dominant ownership model emerging in the Irish media.  When will that legislation be introduced?

It would be of major help to the Opposition if we could get some information on one particular Bill from the Taoiseach, because the Opposition parties, when they were in Government, promised this legislation for five or six years——

Another promised Bill is the legislation to provide for an amendment of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, which is in need of updating.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."There has been much discussion at international level on how best to deal with financial institutions in distress.  Clearly, Ireland has much to offer in this debate given recent experience.  As we move to implement the restructuring of the domestic banking system I announced in my statement on 31 March last, it is also important we provide the essential tools to manage and resolve quickly and effectively any of our banks that in the future may be faced with difficulties.The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill offers a necessary framework to enable the national authorities to use a variety of tools to address and resolve financial institutions that find themselves in distress.  As we reform and rebuild our supervisory structure, it is important the Central Bank, as the resolution authority, can avail of such resolution powers which will be regarded internationally as a prerequisite in the post-financial crisis supervisory infrastructure.The programme for Government recognises that a comprehensive and effective bank resolution framework is essential for building a more sustainable economic system but that it is also important the taxpayer should not be left with the bill for resolving failing or failed banks.  The Government programme commits, therefore, to a modern resolution regime for dealing with bank insolvencies and that the banking sector shall contribute the funds to meet this.This new Bill differs from the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act, enacted by the Oireachtas last year, which was very much focused on providing for the reorganisation and restructuring of the domestic banking system in line with the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland.  It conferred powers on the Minister for Finance, after consulting the Governor of the Central Bank, to seek court orders to issue directions to banks, to restructure banks and to reorganise their assets and-or liabilities.However, the Act will have a temporary effect only.  As it is intended its provisions will lapse in 2012, it is necessary, therefore, to have a more permanent framework in place to address credit institution resolution requirements that may arise in the future.  The intention of this legislation is to put such a permanent resolution framework in place so that, if it proves necessary in the future, it will be possible to facilitate the resolution of financial instability in credit institutions at least cost to the State.Ireland is not alone in having to introduce new legislation to deal adequately with failing banks.  Many countries have had to take steps to enhance the national and international frameworks for resolving financial institutions in difficulty.  Both the EU and the G20 are now paying considerable attention to this issue.  The European Commission is expected to publish a proposal for an EU-wide crisis management framework in September.  Our nearest neighbour, the UK, one of the first countries to experience the difficulties of distressed banks in the current crisis and also to experience the lack of an effective toolkit to deal with the problem, introduced a new special resolution regime in its 2009 banking Act.  Other countries, including Denmark and Germany, have also taken steps to establish or enhance their bank resolution regimes.It is important Ireland has a permanent resolution framework to deal with future problems that may arise and that it will never again allow the financial burden for resolving banks to be unduly placed on the taxpayer.  This Bill provides such a permanent special resolution regime in this State and will allow the Central Bank to deal in an effective manner with credit institutions that are failing or likely to fail in the future.  It also provides that this will be done in a way that provides maximum protection for the Exchequer and provides maximum confidence in the financial system as a whole.  The tools, to be provided in this Bill, to achieve these objectives are bridge-banks, the ability to transfer assets and liabilities from failing banks, special management orders, modified liquidation process specific to credit institutions, the formulation of recovery and resolution plans and the establishment of a new credit institutions resolution fund.Part 1 deals with certain preliminary items.  For example, section 2 sets out the definition of several terms used while section 3 makes clear the Bill will succeed the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act and that no institution will simultaneously fall within the ambit of both Acts.  Section 4 sets out the legislation's purposes, which I have already outlined for the House.Part 2 addresses general matters regarding the exercise of the resolution powers provided for in the Bill.  Section 5 provides that the Governor of the Central Bank is responsible for the exercise of the functions of the Central Bank under the Bill, though he may delegate those functions to officers or employees of the bank subject to ensuring the performance of that delegated function is operationally separate from the regulatory and supervisory responsibilities of the bank.  Section 6 is a standard provision that safeguards the independence of the Governor and the Central Bank.  Section 7 will require national authorities to have regard to EU law and relevant guidance in exercising a power under this Bill.Section 8 sets out the conditions that must be fulfilled before the Central Bank can make an intervention in respect of a credit institution.  It will be noted that it is the Central Bank that will, in the first instance, be required to form the opinion that intervention is required in a particular case.  This is an important change of focus to the existing Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act.  Under the latter, the power of initiation largely rests with the Minister.  This is justifiable in dealing with the current emergency crisis and in the context of the large amount of financial support from the State to the Irish banking system.  In the permanent resolution regime as provided for in the Bill, it is important to place the power of initiation to address a failing credit institution with the appropriate banking authority.  However, the Bill provides that the Governor of the Central Bank will be obliged to consult the Minister in appropriate circumstances.Part 3 of the Bill deals with the credit institutions resolution fund.  It is important that taxpayer input into the resolution of future banking problems be minimised and that the banking sector itself should accumulate and have funds available for such a purpose.  The establishment of a fund is essential to achieve this objective.  Section 9 provides for the establishment and purpose of the resolution fund.  Section 10 provides that the Central Bank shall manage and administer the fund.  Sections 11 and 12 provide that the Minister may, and that authorised credit institutions shall, contribute to the fund.  The Minister shall be entitled, however, to be reimbursed from the fund for any contributions made from the Exchequer.  Section 14 provides that the Minister shall make regulations proscribing the level of contribution required from credit institutions, as well as matters governing the administration and operation of the fund.As indicated previously, the Bill provides for a wide range of resolution tools to be available to the Central Bank to deal with distressed or failing banks.  The first of these is set out in Part 4, which provides for the establishment of bridge banks.  These banks will be able to hold, on a temporary basis, the assets and liabilities of a failing or failed bank before they are moved to a sustainable bank.  Section 16 provides that the Central Bank may establish a company, capitalised from the resolution fund, to hold, on a temporary basis, transferred assets and liabilities pending its onward transfer to another institution as soon as practicable.  Section 17 provides that such a bridge bank may carry on a banking business while it is in possession of these banking assets and liabilities.Part 5 deals with the transfer of assets and liabilities that will provide the Central Bank with the power, subject to meeting the prescribed circumstances, to transfer the assets and liabilities of a relevant institution to a third party.  This is similar to the power currently available to me under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act.  What is envisaged may include, if necessary, transferring the assets and liabilities to a bridge bank provided for in this Bill.Section 20 sets out the preconditions to be met before a proposed transfer order can be made by the Central Bank.  Section 21 outlines the arrangements, timing and procedures to be followed prior to making a proposed transfer order, with section 22 covering the contents of the proposed order.  Section 23 provides, however, that transfer orders shall be made by the High Court setting out some of the considerations it may make when hearing the application from the Central Bank.  Sections 24 to 27, inclusive, set out the publication procedures and arrangements for varying or setting aside the court order.  Section 28 details the content of transfer orders.  Section 29 provides that the Minister may, at the request of the Central Bank, provide a financial incentive to facilitate a transfer.  However, the Minister may recover any such amount provided for this purpose from the resolution fund.  Sections 32 and 33 set out the effects of the transfer orders, while section 34 makes specific provision for the transfer of foreign assets and liabilities under a transfer order.Part 6 of the Bill deals with special management orders.  This will be another resolution tool available to the Central Bank and will enable it, in certain prescribed circumstances and subject to a High Court order, to appoint a special manager to an authorised credit institution.  The purpose of the special manager will be to manage the business of the institution having regard to any recovery and resolution plans or to wind down the institution with a view to liquidation.  Section 38 sets out the preconditions for making proposed special management orders.Section 41 provides that the High Court, on application by the Central Bank, shall make a special management order.  Section 45 outlines the information to be included in special management orders.  Sections 46 and 47 deal with the terms of appointment and remuneration of a special manager.  Section 50 is a key provision as its sets out the functions of special managers and provides that the special manager shall take over the management of the business.  Section 52 sets out the effect of the appointment of a special manager, while section 53 will enable the special manager to, if necessary, remove officers or employees of the business.  Section 57 provides for the circumstances in which the special management of an authorised credit institution terminates.Part 7 provides for a modified liquidation process for financial institutions where the liquidator will be mandated with two objectives.  The first is to work with the Central Bank to ensure that deposits covered by the deposit protection scheme receive payment or else to have the deposits transferred to a sound institution and, second, to achieve the best results for the institution's creditors as a whole.  Section 60 provides that the Central Bank may petition the High Court to wind up an authorised credit institution.  Section 61 provides that no other person may seek to appoint a liquidator to an authorised credit institution without first informing the bank of such a proposed course of action and obtaining confirmation from the bank that it has no objection to such a step.  Section 62 further provides that only a liquidator approved by the bank may be appointed to a credit institution.  This will ensure that the Central Bank will have overall control of any proposal to seek to appoint a liquidator to a credit institution.Section 63 provides for the objectives of a liquidator to an authorised credit institution.  Section 64 provides that finance may be made available from the deposit protection fund or the credit institutions resolution fund in order to facilitate the transfer of deposits from a failing bank.  Section 65 provides that any such payment will constitute a debt due by the credit institution.  Sections 66 to 69, inclusive, deal with a liquidation committee to which the liquidator will be required to report.  Section 70 provides assurance to depositors whose deposits have been transferred by a liquidator.Part 8 deals with recovery plans and resolution plans.  This part is intended to enable the Central Bank and each institution to make appropriate preparation to deal with potential financial difficulty.  Specifically, it will empower the Central Bank to require an authorised credit institution to prepare and implement a recovery plan and the Central Bank to prepare and implement a resolution plan.  Sections 73 and 74 provide that the bank may direct an institution to prepare and implement a recovery plan and section 75 provides that the Central Bank may prepare a resolution plan.Part 9 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions necessary to ensure that the powers provided under the Bill are effective.  Section 77 is a key provision as it is necessary to ensure that the reorganisation and restructuring measures provided for in the Bill can be recognised in other EU member states through the mechanisms available in the credit institutions winding up directive, CIWUD, on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions.  This directive provides that the authorities in the home member state alone shall be empowered to decide on the implementation of reorganisation or winding-up proceedings of an authorised credit institutions in accordance with its own laws and that such decisions shall be effective in all the other member states.  This is particularly important given that many agreements, including debt agreements, entered into by Irish credit institutions are governed by the laws of other member states.  The existing Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act has similar provisions and this critical provision will, therefore, be retained in the permanent resolution Act for authorised credit institutions.Sections 79 and 80 provide for confidentiality provisions in the operation of the Bill, if these are considered necessary in particular instances for stability reasons.  Section 81 deals with agreements to which an authorised credit institution, any of its subsidiaries, its holding company and any sister company, are party or in which they have an interest.  Agreements may provide for their termination or other consequences in certain circumstances.  This section provides that none of the specified consequences will arise by virtue of certain actions, including among others, the enactment of the Bill, the publication of the Bill, the making of any statement by the Minister, the Central Bank or an authorised credit institution with regard to the Bill, or the Bill itself and the use of any powers under the Bill.  Sections 83 and 84 provide for the limitation of judicial review and of certain rights of appeal to the Supreme Court.  Sections 88 and 89 provide that the Central Bank may issue guidelines on the exercise of its functions under the Bill and also that the Minister may specify a relationship framework to govern his relationship with the Central Bank.  The Bill also provides for some technical amendments to a number of other enactments and statutory instruments, including the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.This Bill is a most important one for consideration by Members of the Oireachtas. It is essential, not only for sound financial stability reasons but also for our future general economic well-being that the national banking authorities will have the most comprehensive and effective tool kit available to them to preserve and protect individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole.  The Bill will provide these important tools.  The future protection of our financial system, depositors and taxpayers requires nothing less.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill.  Fianna Fáil will support this Bill.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad prior to the new Government coming into office but events at the time did not allow for its progression.  The Minister has reintroduced it in the House today and Fianna Fáil welcomes and supports it.Second Stage provides us an opportunity to discuss some of the wider issues to the fore currently.  It is appropriate that discussion of the Bill comes at a time of unprecedented crisis in the eurozone and at a time when the Greek Parliament is discussing an austerity package of €28 billion and when a privatisation plan of €50 billion must be decided upon.  The current crisis underlines the gross inadequacy of the European Union's ability to deal with a crisis of this nature.  Its response to date has been reactionary, ad hoc and has failed to deal in a comprehensive way with the scale of the crisis facing the eurozone at this time and it is breathtaking to think that a parliamentary vote in just one national parliament in Europe has the potential to derail the whole eurozone and the single currency project.  It behoves us in this House and every other national parliament to do what we can to ensure that once this crisis passes, the lessons are learned and proper legislation is put in put in place to deal with any future crisis.The Bill introduced here today is part of an overall package of measures required to improve the regulatory framework.  It makes available to the Central Bank and the Minister a wider set of powers in the event of a bank threatening the stability of our financial system in the future and in the event of a bank having to be wound down.  Looking at the markets currently, the contagion effect of the Greek crisis is having an impact on Ireland, with a cost of borrowing of in excess of 12% on ten-year Government bonds.  It is clear that the markets view Ireland as being in a similar boat to Greece and Portugal.  We need to do everything possible to put clear water between our position as a state and the position of Greece.  We will only be able to assess the market perception of Ireland when the current crisis passes.  Now, we can say that it is the Greek situation that is contaminating the perception towards Ireland, but once this is dealt with — hopefully it will be dealt with quickly and comprehensively — we will need to see an improvement in market sentiment towards Ireland.In the past couple of weeks, the Minister welcomed the decision by EU finance Ministers, to which he was party, to quash plans to attach preferred creditor status to funds advanced to existing bailout countries under the European stability mechanism, due to come into effect in mid-2013.  This is a helpful development.  It would be unwise to overstate its significance, but I accept the comment made by the Minister that it is an issue he raised in his recent visit to the United States.  It was a concern for investors and it is helpful that the issue has been addressed.The wider market sentiment towards Ireland will be shaped by a number of issues, including the market perception of debt sustainability in Ireland, the extent to which we can achieve economic growth this year and next, the public finances and the extent to which the Government adheres to the fiscal measures required to bring the country's deficit back to within 3% of GDP by 2015.There is a huge task facing the Government and the country to ensure that in 12 to 18 months time, Ireland will be in a position to return to the international sovereign debt markets. Given the current environment, the scale of volatility that exists and the questions that hang over the eurozone, this cannot be countenanced currently, but over the next 12 to 18 months we need to get to that position.  For that reason, it is essential we seek to achieve economic growth.  Last week's CSO figures gave a mixed picture.  Unsurprisingly, domestic demand is still very weak, but exports continue to perform strongly.  Hopefully, the jobs initiative which will come into effect this week will have a positive impact.  We will watch the live register figures, the Exchequer returns and other economic indicators over the next number of months to gauge whether the measures taken are having a positive impact.The comment made by Mario Draghi when questioned by Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, with regard to the ECB providing medium term funding to Ireland was a setback, because the markets attach some importance to the issue of having a secure stream of funding for the Irish banking system.  The ECB and the eurozone have committed to providing ongoing liquidity support but market commentators have pointed to the issue of a medium term funding commitment as something that could have been helpful.  It is disappointing that opportunity was not taken.During the Minister's recent visit to the United States, he announced on behalf of the Government the intention to impose losses on unsecured, unguaranteed senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  It has since been clarified that this intention is based on having the support of the European Central Bank to do so.  The critical question is the position of the ECB with regard to imposing losses on unsecured, unguaranteed bondholders in institutions that are, effectively, being wound down.  We support the Minister's intention to impose such losses.Every tool available to the Government should be used to convince the European Central Bank to allow such burden-sharing with these bondholders.  It is important to point out, however, that an unsecured, unguaranteed bond associated with Anglo Irish Bank worth €200 million was repaid last month.  Even since the Minister's announcement in the United States on 15 June, a far more modest bond, worth €14 million, was repaid in the case of Anglo Irish Bank.  Another bond, worth €12 million, falls due for repayment tomorrow.  I presume the latter will be repaid.  While these bonds may appear quite small, if we were in a position to achieve a discount thereon in the shorter term, it would go a long way towards alleviating the damage done by some of the cuts being imposed on, for example, school transport schemes and to the number of special needs assistants in schools.An unsecured, unguaranteed bond of €12 million is being repaid tomorrow in Anglo Irish Bank.  The Minister stated he intends to raise this issue in the autumn with the troika.  I heard his comment on Sunday that he will raise the matter in July but that he believes meaningful negotiations will be deferred until the autumn.  He needs to raise the matter immediately because much smaller bonds are being repaid as we speak.  Clearly, if we are in a position to secure discounts on those bonds, the sooner, the better.  The money could be put to much better use in the shorter term.  I urge the Minister to take the opportunity to raise this with the troika immediately to try to obtain its permission to impose the losses.  The Minister has indicated that the Government will not be proceeding without the support of the European Central Bank when imposing such losses.There was suspicion that the European Central Bank had threatened to cut off the liquidity supply to Irish banks in the event of Ireland unilaterally imposing losses on senior bondholders.  The Minister has indicated this is not the position and that the European Central Bank is not in the business of making such threats.  Given that the paying off of unsecured, unguaranteed bondholders forms no part of the EU-IMF agreement, it is an issue that the Government should address urgently.  It should seek to achieve the savings on behalf of the Irish taxpayer in the short term.I do not want to be cynical but the Minister's comments in the United States came on day 99 of the Government's first 100 days in office.  It was a very useful element of the following day's marketing and PR campaign for the Government to be able to say it would be imposing losses on senior bondholders.  The truth, however, is that there was nothing new in the statement, given that the initiative would be dependent on the support of the European Central Bank.  If a 50% discount were achieved on the €3.5 billion, approximately, in unsecured, unguaranteed debt left in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, it would save us €1.75 billion, which would be greater than the cumulative benefit of the interest-rate reduction we are negotiating.  This is an important issue.  We want to see both a reduction in the interest rate and also the imposition of burden sharing on the senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.We very much welcome the Bill.  It was introduced by former Senator Donie Cassidy in Seanad Éireann on 28 February on behalf of the late Brian Lenihan.  It lapsed on the dissolution of the 23rd Seanad on 26 April of this year but has now been resurrected in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.The Bill builds on the emergency legislation enacted in December of last year to reorganise and restructure the Irish retail banking system, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, which will still apply to certain relevant institutions until it expires at the end of 2012.  Therefore, the intention is that the Bill will put in place a permanent resolution regime and replace the temporary measures included in the stabilisation legislation last December.  Clearly, existing company law provisions are inadequate to deal the unwinding and shutting down of a financial institution in the State.  This begs the question as to what might have been the case had we had the legislation in 2008 when the banking system was on the brink of collapse.  The Nyberg report refers to this issue when it stated, "the existence of a resolution regime in itself would not necessarily have been a panacea to avoid high fiscal costs to the State in the absence of burden sharing with creditors".Professor Patrick Honohan refers to the discussion paper that had been prepared in 2008 by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland on the issue.  That paper was discussed by the domestic standing group but the associated legislation did not proceed in time to address the banking crisis of September 2008.  One can have all the resolution regimes in the world but, ultimately, if the position of one's paymaster, the European Central Bank, is that no bank can be allowed to fail in a disorderly manner and losses cannot be imposed on senior bondholders, it does not matter what resolution regime there is in place in terms of reducing the cost to the taxpayer.  The position of the European Central Bank appears not to have changed.  I wish the Minister well in his efforts to convince the ECB that Ireland is in a position to impose the losses because Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are effectively being wound down.  The sooner this happens, the better.The Bill is in response to an EU-IMF commitment in addition to being in the programme of Government of the new Government parties.  It provides a comprehensive special resolution regime for dealing with bank insolvencies and provides the framework for the introduction of a bank levy.  The press release issued by the Minister at the time of the republication of the Bill implies Committee Stage amendments are being prepared that are "designed to enhance the resolution toolset in line with the evolving EU principles on crisis resolution and in the light of discussions with the external partners".This is an issue in respect of which there is evolving policy at European level.  If we have learned anything from the crisis over the past three years, it is that there is a need for a co-ordinated, pan-European response to a financial crisis.  While we are obliged to equip the Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland with the tools necessary to protect the taxpayer and the stability of our system in the event of financial institutions getting into trouble, this obligation needs to be replicated at EU level, where the impact can be much greater given the interconnectedness and interdependence of the banking and financial systems.The tools available to the Central Bank under this legislation have been summarised by the Minister.  They include the transfer order, the special management order, the establishment of a "bridge bank", a modified liquidation process, and the development of recovery and resolution plans.  It is essential that all these tools be available and put in place as quickly as possible so they will be available to the authorities in Ireland in the event of future difficulties.Section 4 of the Bill sets out the purposes of the legislation.  Section 8 details the intervention conditions required for the powers in the legislation to be invoked, including whether the authorised credit institution concerned is of systemic importance to the economy of the State; whether the failure of that credit institution would be likely to contribute to instability of the banking system; the importance of ensuring the depositors of that credit institution will continue to have prompt access to their deposits; the importance of maintaining public confidence in the financial system; the importance of maintaining continuity of banking services to that credit institution's customers; the terms of any resolution plan; and any other matters that the bank considers relevant.The legislation gives wide-ranging powers to the Governor of the Central Bank to act in the event of a threat to the stability of our financial system, the taxpayers and customers of individual financial institutions.  The proposed establishment, under section 12, of the credit institutions resolution fund is welcome and will help to obviate the costs associated with future banking and financial crises.  Under section 14, the Minister must make regulations in regard to the establishment of the fund and how exactly it will operate.  It would be helpful if later in the debate the Minister indicates his thinking on how the fund will operate and how quickly he envisages it will be established, the level and structure of fees to be paid into the fund by the institutions concerned and the circumstances under which the fund can be invoked to reduce the bill to the State in the event of any future banking difficulties.We support the Bill.  I look forward to detailed engagement with the Minister on Committee Stage when I hope we will be able to discuss in detail the individual sections.  It is legislation which properly equips the authorities in the State to deal with any future difficulties in the Irish banking system.  It is against the backdrop of a crisis not only in Ireland but in the eurozone.  I hope the Minister continues to represent Ireland's interests with strength and conviction.  I urge him to raise at the earliest opportunity with the troika the issue of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and those senior bondholders being repaid as we speak.  While the amount of money might be quite modest in comparison with the $1 billion bond that will mature on 2 November, any savings achieved could be put to very good use.  We fully support the Minister in his efforts to reduce this burden.

Tá tú iontach flaithiúil.  Sílim nach mbeidh mé ag glacadh an ama uilig ar an Chéim seo den Bhille.  Sin ráite, tá sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh deis againn an Bille a scanáil agus a phlé amach go maith nuair atáimid ar Chéim an Choiste.  Mar a tharla le cuid des na Billí a tháinig os ár gcomhair go dtí seo, go háirithe an Bille Airgeadais (Uimh. 3), nuair atá an Dáil ag tabhairt tacaíochta do Bhille, ní cheart go mbeimid ag labhairt agus ag labhairt.  Is ar Chéim an Choiste a mbíonn am de dhíth orainn le plé a dhéanamh ar Bhille.I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Central Bank and Credit Institutions Bill 2011 because it is extremely important and will require the careful consideration of the House.  If it is to become a useful tool in dealing with future banking crises it is important that all sides of the House have the time and opportunity to deal in a meaningful way with the Bill and to try to shape it, particularly on Committee Stage.  I want to emphasise this point.  The lesson learned from legislation that has gone through the House so far is that where there is broad agreement there is no need for open-ended debate and Deputies on this side of the House will not abuse the system.  However, where time is needed to deal with the detail of legislation, particularly on Committee Stage when we get into the nuts and bolts of what is contained in a Bill, it is important that time is set aside.  I am sure the Government will assist us in this.Last December, Fianna Fáil rushed through in a heavy-handed way the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill.  One of the reasons Fine Gael and the Labour Party joined Sinn Féin in opposing that Bill was because the Government refused to allow adequate time for discussing and amending the Bill.  I hope the Government affords us the opportunity to deal with the amendments that will be tabled.  I am aware the Government also proposes to table amendments.  It is important that we shape the Bill and have the time required to do so as the Government parties demanded when they were in opposition.Sinn Féin supports the introduction of special resolution regime legislation.  We called for it in the previous Dáil and we welcome that the basis for it has been proposed in the Bill.  The financial and banking crisis of recent years has exposed the inadequacies of commercial law in providing the necessary tools for dealing with insolvent banks.  There is a clear need for strong powers to be invested in the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank with adequate oversight by the Oireachtas to enable the State to wind down failing financial institutions in a way that protects ordinary depositors and taxpayers.While it is probably too early to say there is a model of best practice in the design and implementation of such special resolution regimes, there is growing international consensus on the basic requirements.  However, having the right tools is only half the job as we all know.  Governments must have the political will to step in and use these tools not only to ensure the stability and effective functioning of the financial system but also to protect the broader public interest.  This is important because unless this Bill is used in the proper way and unless the political will exists to do so it will be meaningless.Prior to considering the ability of the Bill to meet the challenge of future banking crises, it is important to deal with the more urgent issues of how to free the State and taxpayers from the enormous liabilities imposed by the previous Government's disastrous banking policy, a policy which is now being followed religiously by the new Government.  Recently, I took the opportunity to re-read some of the transcripts of last December's Dáil debate on the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill.  I wanted to refresh my memory about what was stated at the time about that legislation, which was rushed through the Dáil, particularly by members of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Some of the comments are very interesting.Deputy Leo Varadkar was particularly critical of the failure of the Bill to include "any provision for the restructuring of the debts of senior bondholders, particularly those who are not under the guarantee".  He rightly described the failure as the big lacuna in the Bill.  Deputy Joan Burton made a similar point in her remarks, when she described the Bill as too little too late because "it does nothing to address the treatment of liabilities other than subordinated bondholders.  It fails to address the issue of senior bondholders now out of the guarantee".  The criticisms of Deputies Varadkar and Burton were on the money.  The Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill should have provided the Government with the legal tools necessary to impose significant burden sharing on senior guaranteed and unguaranteed bonds.Having made such trenchant criticisms of the Bill last December, many of us expected that as both Deputies now sit at the Cabinet table, Fine Gael and the Labour Party would have ensured the revised Central Bank and Credit Institutions Bill now before the House would fully and adequately address this major issue and that burden sharing would be on the agenda.  However, when we examine the content of the Bill — and I acknowledge it is Fianna Fáil legislation — we see it fails to deal in any way with the issue of senior bondholders in covered and uncovered institutions.Worse than this, it takes a backward step from its emergency predecessor of last December by submerging even the now uncontentious junior bondholders into the general category of creditors.  Worse still, the Bill leaves the matter of how best to deal with bondholders at the discretion of the liquidators appointed by the Governor of the Central Bank.  This is despite the fact that best practice suggests that a special resolution regime should clearly outline how best to deal with creditors.  As it stands, the Bill leaves this crucial area of decision-making to the liquidator.The previous speaker spoke about the announcements made by the Government.  With regard to unguaranteed debt in Anglo Irish Bank, on which the Government and Fianna Fáil solely focus, since the start of the year €1 billion of unguaranteed debt has been paid out by the taxpayer.  Under the watchful eye of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party €800 million was paid out, and under the watchful eye of Fine Gael and the Labour Party almost €250 million has been paid out, in unguaranteed unsecured debt in Anglo Irish Bank.  This is appalling when on a daily basis we hear and speak about the cuts affecting real people who have real needs, such as parents who must pay an extra €50 to get their children to school in the morning; the discontinuation of ambulance services for cancer or dialysis patients; or the closure of accident and emergency units in hospitals along the west coast of Ireland and other places.  Consider these cuts along with the magnitude of cuts in social welfare.  Public representatives deal with the fallout of this on a daily basis.  However, it is those who have had cuts imposed on them who must bear the heavy burden.  Social welfare cuts totalling €800 million were imposed in last year's budget.  In such circumstances, it does not make sense that the Government and previous Administration paid out €1 billion in unguaranteed debt in Anglo Irish Bank.Three weeks ago, I stated in the House that the first step the Minister must take is to act on the issue of unsecured and unguaranteed senior bonds.  His announcement in recent days that he intends to seek burden sharing by unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society was a small but welcome step.  It is rare that I welcome a Government decision when speaking to the cameras on the plinth.  I did so, however, on the day of the Minister's statement because it was a welcome step.  Since then, however, we have since the unwinding of his statement, which seems to have been related to the Government's first 100 days in power.  The Minister appears to have listened to the International Monetary Fund on his visit to the United States given that the IMF was highly critical of the previous Government for buckling on the issue of imposing burden sharing on bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  The fund seems to have got into the Minister's ear because he had the guts to announce that he planned to impose losses on holders of unsecured and unguaranteed bonds.  Within days, however, both he and the Taoiseach unpicked his statement and the Government reverted to the position set out in the Fine Gael Party general election manifesto that burden sharing would only take place with the consent of the European Central Bank.  That position is simply not good enough.  The Government must take the necessary first step by telling our European partners that it will move with or without their approval.  While it is important to seek their approval for burden sharing, we must also protect the interests of those who, as a result of the huge burden the State is carrying, will not receive health and education services, are having social welfare payments cut or are on low incomes which are covered by the joint labour committees.A further €13 billion of unguaranteed and unsecured bonds is held by the other four covered institutions.  The holders of these bonds must be included in burden sharing.  I listened to the Minister's statement in the United States in which he referred to the justification for burning bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  The same justification applies to bondholders in the other four institutions whose bonds were not covered by the State guarantee and are not backed by securities.  Despite this, the Irish taxpayer will pay money into the banks next month to cover them.  That position is not sustainable.  It is socially provocative to act in this manner and the move should not proceed on the watch of any Government.  The full €16 billion of unguaranteed, unsecured bonds should be subject to rigorous burden sharing with a view to reducing the liabilities of the State.  This is not a case of getting at investors but of standing up for Irish interests and trying to reduce the debt liability of the State.  The investors in question invested in banks in the hope of making a quick buck.  Unfortunately for them, their investment did not work out.  There is no social, economic or ethical argument to support taxpayers footing the bill for speculative debts.  In addition to €16 billion of unguaranteed, unsecured debt, the covered institutions hold €20 billion of unguaranteed, secured bonds.  These, too, should be subject to burden sharing and the Bill should provide a legal framework for doing so.We have heard much about the State guarantee, particularly from the Labour Party both in opposition and government.  The simple facts are that the State guarantee covers less than one third of the bonds in the covered institutions.  In other words, the State did not give its word, whether correctly or incorrectly, that it would repay more than two thirds of the bonds in the covered institutions.  The Labour Party wants to go further than the guarantee because not only does it propose to repay the €20 billion in guaranteed bonds but it also wants to throw into the pot the additional €40 billion in unguaranteed bonds consisting of secured and unsecured bonds.  That approach must be abandoned.  The guarantee is not crippling the State because it is still possible to impose burden sharing on holders of unguaranteed senior bonds.  The memorandum of understanding does not include a condition specifying that the bonds be paid in full, nor do any legal obstacles stand in the way of burden sharing.  Two Government Ministers, Deputies Burton and Varadkar, were among the most outspoken proponents of burden sharing while in opposition.  Now that they are in government, they should call for the introduction of burden sharing.The single most valuable function of an effective special resolution regime would be to provide the Government with the necessary tools to extract itself and the taxpayer from the liabilities in question in a manner that protects ordinary citizens, taxpayers and depositors.  Unfortunately, it appears from both the text of the Bill and comments made by the Minister and Taoiseach in recent days that the Government intends to honour almost all of the debts of senior bondholders, irrespective of whether they are covered by the guarantee.  I understand the Government intends to introduce substantial amendments on Committee Stage and it is possible that its amendments will address the issue of senior bondholders.  Assuming, however, that it is not the Government's intention to address this important issue, I signal my intention to table the necessary amendments to ensure that, notwithstanding the Government's intentions, future Administrations will at least have available to them the tools necessary to abandon the disastrous policy of wasting tens of billions of taxpayers' euro in honouring private senior debts and bonds, including those not covered by the blanket guarantee.  I say this in the knowledge that if the Government lasts its full course, it will have paid out all the bonds.As is evident from recent events in Greece, there is an urgency about this issue which we cannot underestimate.  Our debt to GDP ratio has surpassed 100% and our contingent liabilities have reached €193 billion, a staggering 125% of GDP.  Increasingly, independent economists share Sinn Féin's view that the State will not be in a position to return to the markets in 2013 when the EU-IMF bailout funds run out.  This scenario is all the more likely to materialise if unemployment continues to increase, as it has done in recent weeks, and growth projections are not realised.  In such circumstances, Ireland will, in only a few years, be in exactly the same position Greece finds itself in today as it seeks a second bailout.  While none of us, regardless of our political affiliations, wants such a scenario to materialise, it is likely, even if the Minister for Finance is unable to agree because he must be careful of market sentiment.The recovery plan agreed between the Government and its external partners, as they are known, namely, the European Union and International Monetary Fund, is based on GNP growth of 0.3% this year and 2% in 2012.  The Central Statistics Office recently published statistics for the first quarter of 2011 which show a decline in GNP of 4.3%.  While questions of accuracy arise with regard to quarterly GNP figures, we must be alarmed by the magnitude of the difference between the Government's annual projection of 0.6% GNP growth and a quarterly decline of 4.3% recorded in the first three months of the year.  In raising this issue I am not engaging in scaremongering, an accusation previously levelled at me by the Minister, but stating my belief that we must get our heads together and consider other scenarios because we are blindly walking towards an unstructured default.  While other options and positions are available, unfortunately the Government is not availing of them.  The only way to avoid the disastrous scenario of default is to reduce the level of debt and scale of liabilities bearing down on the State and taxpayers.Imposing losses on senior bondholders and exiting the blanket guarantee are prerequisites for economic recovery.  Unfortunately, if the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill is anything to go by, the Government is not seriously considering either option.Despite all the pre-election rhetoric about burning senior bondholders and seeking an exit strategy from the blanket guarantee, it appears to be wedded to implementing the same failed banking policies of its predecessors.I am also concerned about the provisions in the Bill relating to State funding for the credit institutions resolution fund.  The creation of such a fund is clearly necessary, and I support the Bill's intention to make it a legal requirement for the banks to contribute to that fund.  However, there is no reason that the taxpayer, having already put €46 billion into the banks with the commitment of a further €24 billion, not to mention the money sewn up in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, should even contemplate contributions to a resolution fund, the purpose of which is to pay creditors in the event of a bank collapse.  No blank cheques should be issued by this Government or Parliament to such a fund in the future.  The Minister acknowledged that we may recoup the money.  It is not the word "may" that should be in the legislation, but "shall".  There is no way that parliamentarians should sign up for further blank cheques to this fund.The Bill effectively gives the Minister for Finance a blank cheque for the use of taxpayers' money for a fund whose costs are as yet unknown.  We know only too well what happens when blank cheques are issued and left in the hands of Ministers whose banking policy is not dictated by the interests of the citizens or taxpayers of the State but by the interests of the ECB.  Sinn Féin will not be a party to the issuing of blank cheques by this Government.  All such costs in the future must be borne by the banks and their creditors in a manner consistent with protecting the public interest.In light of the scale of the economic crisis facing not just this State but the EU in general, I will conclude by outlining the three key steps which Sinn Féin believes are necessary if a resolution to our collective debt crisis is to be achieved.  These steps are not exhaustive but I believe they must be pursued by the Minister.  First, we must secure a reduction in the level of debt and exposure to liabilities by the State and its taxpayers.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill, if appropriately amended, could provide the Government with a valuable tool in achieving this objective.  However, it will also require the political will to impose burden sharing on senior bondholders across all categories.Second, we must change the terms of the debate on the interest rate reduction being sought on the EU portion of the austerity programme.  It is simply not acceptable for the European Union to benefit financially from the loan extended to a partner member state which is in economic difficulty.  That is the basis on which we should be involved in this discussion.  Based on the current interest rate, our so-called partners in Europe are set to profit by approximately €10 billion as a result of the 3% mark-up on the interest rate.  They are some partners.  They will make a profit of €10 billion from the European portion of the loan to a country that is in deep financial trouble and is bailing out European banks across Europe.  The Minister must stop politely begging for a 0.6% reduction in the interest rate on future borrowings but deal with the real issue, which is why our partners in Europe are profiting from a misfortune which they played a part in creating.Third, it is time for the Government to acknowledge the ECB's contribution to Ireland's and Europe's debt crisis through its failure to adequately regulate European inter-bank lending at the height of the crisis.  That is not an attempt to absolve Irish bankers or politicians for domestic failures, but it is an important part of the overall picture.  The ECB must also shoulder its share of the burden and the Government must put negotiated loss sharing on the table with the ECB.  Our debt level has already reached an unsustainable level and we are heading towards an unstructured default.  If this is to be avoided, the Government must act to reduce the debt burden on the taxpayer, end the punitive interest rate on the loan and seek loss sharing with the ECB.  Only then will our economy and society be freed of the debt burden imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government and be in a position to start the process of investing in social and economic recovery.I look forward to teasing out the details of this Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope we will have the time required to do so.

The public is also fed up with wealthy bankers who receive large salaries and bonuses from banks that would have failed if the Government had not intervened.  It is not before time for this legislation to be before the House.  My only regret, and many other people share it, is that legislation was not in place before the disastrous demise of Ireland's banking system.While I accept that the Government is anxious to put the problems of the Irish banks to rest, and I welcome in principle many elements of this Bill, it is imperative that it confronts the reality of preventing the financial system from collapsing again, which is not the same as repairing it.  The previous speaker referred to bondholders.  This has become a tricky subject for both Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who made many sterling promises before the election as to how they would deal with senior bondholders.  This issue is fudged again in the Bill.  Irish people are saying that if we are in control of the banks, we can surely force the senior bondholders to bear the losses.  An overwhelming number of people in this country want that to happen.  As they see it, senior bondholders gambled recklessly with our money and brought the country to its knees, but are once again escaping the pain.Everybody in this country, ranging from small business people to the person working in a bank, has realised what has happened economically in Ireland over the last number of years and all of them have educated themselves to the fact that we were robbed by the senior bondholders, who gambled our money away.  They ask why these people are not being dealt with.  That is my single reservation about this Bill.  Since the start of the financial crisis, Denmark is the only European country that has imposed any losses on senior bondholders.  To date, no eurozone has imposed mandatory burden sharing on senior bondholders by way of legislation.  That is fundamentally wrong, particularly when one sees what ordinary people in this country have had to pay as a result of the actions of the bondholders.The Bill provides for the establishment of a resolution fund to minimise taxpayers' exposure to future financial sector difficulties.  The fund will be funded by contributions from credit institutions.  The Bill appears to provide that should an institution not contribute to the fund, it will be unable to carry on its business and will be guilty of an offence.  That is fine, but bearing in mind how financially crippled most of the institutions in the State are, I have reservations as to whether meaningful contributions to this fund are a realistic prospect at present or whether taxpayers in future years might again have to pick up the tab.  It is not very clear in the Bill.The inclusion of the credit unions in the provisions of the Bill is timely given that their trade body, the Irish League of Credit Unions or ILCU, which maintains a small stabilisation fund, is reported to have made losses of €43.5 million last year, stemming from €48 million in guarantees and commitments provided by its savings protection scheme to 13 credit unions and €5.5 million in investment losses.  It appears that further losses are inevitable, based on this information and the fact that at least one in five credit unions was unable to pay a dividend last year.  This must be further examined.There are some slight signs of recovery in small businesses, and I have met business people whose books have begun to fill.  The only problem is that, once again, they cannot get money or loans from the banks.  All Deputies are hearing this.  I do not know whether the banks have lost the skill to lend money or are deliberately not lending it, but they are not doing so.  If the State can take such a sweeping approach as to take over banks, surely we can further compel them to lend.  They are taking in money to build up their reserves but not lending money so that people can generate growth within the economy.It is all very well for the State to look after the banks.  Where does the Bill provide for the State to look after the ordinary people who need funding from the banks?  I do not see it.  Regardless of all the statistics we hear, the word among small business owners is that the two so-called pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, are not meeting the borrowing needs of small and medium enterprises.  Struggling business cannot keep going if they cannot get money from the banks.The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, claims that access to loans has not improved since the Government extracted lending commitments from the Bank of Ireland and AIB as a condition of rescuing those institutions with billions of euro of State capital.  We need to look at this comprehensively.  It is all very well for the banks to tell us they are giving out money.  Every Deputy has spoken to people who are trying to set up a small business, keep one going, recover or expand and who cannot get money from banks.  The economy will go nowhere if that does not happen.I agree with much of the Bill.  However, it does nothing to deal with the people who have put us into this crisis.  We have not compelled the banks to help get us out of the crisis by lending money, which was hard-earned by taxpayers and which established the banks in the first place, to keep businesses going.  The focus of this legislation should not be on the needs of the banks but on the need of the economy for credit.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I am delighted to be able to speak on the Bill.  It is timely, indeed overdue.  The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for an effective and expeditious resolution regime for certain credit institutions at the least cost to the State, and goodness knows we have had enough costs, to amend certain enactments and for related matters.  This is a wonderful aspiration and I welcome the fact that the Bill is being brought forward and that we are discussing it here.  However, it has many shortcomings.Like previous speakers, I am concerned for Seán Citizen.  Ordinary people, workers and families are finding things so difficult.  They are aghast at the stories they see reported in the media and elsewhere about the huge mess the banks are in.  The banks gave commitments to the late Minister, Brian Lenihan, that were total untruths.  Commitments were given but statements had to be dragged out of representatives of the banks and we still do not know if we have heard the complete details of the depth of the crisis, although I feel we may have done so.  I do not blame the ordinary staff of the banks.  They do a good job and work hard and have suffered much vitriol in recent times from people whose savings were wiped out.  We have heard case after case of this.  It is important that we have regulations to deal with this crisis because it will, more than likely, happen again.  This is not the first time.People are aghast that no one has been brought to account.  We see bonuses being paid out.  The late Minister, Brian Lenihan, tried to cap a senior banker's salary at €500,000.  He was told he could not do so.  The bank had to pay the increased salary under the table or find some other way to pay it.  That is disgraceful.  I compliment the Taoiseach and his Ministers on introducing a cap on public service salaries.  Now that we have almost 100% control of banks we should also introduce a cap on bank salaries.  Deputy Ross referred earlier to a person who is CEO of one company and on the board of others and is recommending cutting the wages of ordinary people.  He is robbing Peter to pay Paul, although he himself is Paul.  This is unfortunate and wrong.We voted twice on the Lisbon treaty and twice for the Maastricht treaty.  Those treaties imposed strict guidelines on inter-bank lending.  European banks were at least 50% responsible for what happened in Ireland.  There were two sides to the story.  When Irish bankers ran out of credit, customers went to European banks and got crazy limits.  Now that we are in trouble our so-called friends in Europe will not help us.  With friends like those, who needs enemies?  They have left us high and dry.I was not happy with the deal the previous Government made with the IMF.  I made that clear at the time.  The current Government has adopted the same policy.  However, the IMF, at least, gave us a reasonable interest rate.  Our European friends are making a healthy profit from us.  The figure of €10 billion has been quoted as the amount European banks will make over the course of our repayments, if we ever repay.  This debt must be postponed or extended.  We do not know what will happen in Greece today.  If we do not postpone the repayments we could face an unstructured default, which would be worse.  The European banks should be made take their share of the pain.  Burden sharing must be imposed.The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made elaborate and flamboyant promises.  The people did not really believe them, but they created expectations.  Deputy Gilmore said it must be Labour's way not Frankfurt's way.  What happened to those idle promises?  People have been badly let down.  There is a seething anger in people who see what is going on.  They see us trying to pay this debt when we do not have the money to run our hospitals, maintain our school transport service, keep small rural schools open and functioning or do so many things.  Our borrowing is now at 125% of gross national product.One can find commentators to give any kind of prediction.  I welcome Deputy Mathews, who has come into the House, and compliment him on his honesty in all debates.  He has a knowledge of banking and much experience.Promises were made but we have seen total U-turns.  I am disappointed in the Taoiseach, who said ever penny would be paid back and senior bondholders would not be touched.  He then went to America and met the IMF where he had a rush of blood to the head and said he would consider renegotiation.  Of course, our friends in the troika said that was not possible.  They said the Taoiseach would have to do what they asked.  The west wind in Mayo could not blow pipe-dreams ashore.  The Taoiseach was put back in his box very quickly.  We must stand up for the ordinary workers and families.  They cannot take any more of this.The bankers' bonus culture prevails.  Not one person has been brought before the courts.  Last year, the Garda Commissioner said he expected charges to be brought last November.  He then retired and went off into the sunset with his pension and there has been no sign of charges.  How could the prosecution process take such a long time?We hear various predictions, and they are all worrying.  We must impose burden sharing on speculators, although we need speculators and investors.  They themselves are amazed at how they have got away things.  Members of the Government, when in opposition, made all kinds of threats but they have simply moved seats in the Chamber and adopted the same policies.  The senior bondholders are gamblers who hoped to make a killing and they made killings for a number of years.    They have had a bad harvest this year but, unlike them, ordinary people are reaping the ruin.  They are speculators and gamblers; that is the nature of their business.  They must be held accountable and made to pay because ordinary men, women and children cannot be forced to do so.I am delighted credit unions are covered by the Bill because worrying stories have emerged about a number of them.  We all know that, but for them, many people would not be able to do anything.  The Minister for Finance has been encouraging people to spend, including in a radio interview on Sunday.  While I welcome the initiatives to attract tourists, including the reduction in VAT from next Friday, people still cannot access funds.  The banks do not have a cent and so-called pillar banks are telling us untruths.  I compliment Bank of Ireland on the week-long business banking promotion it has run in recent years.  Its officials bring in small business owners to try to help them.  However, many of the business people have worked hard to earn overdrafts, which have been cancelled overnight.  They are called in to renegotiate their overdraft and by the time they leave the branch, their overdraft has been terminated and they have been forced to take a term loan.  The banks are then writing up these loans, which have been forced on business people, as new lending as if they had taken an application over the counter for them, which is a total distortion of the facts.  This could not be further from the truth.  Banks are not lending money.I heard  a woman talking the other day about being unable to purchase a house because of NAMA.  Many people are selling houses.  I spoke to an auctioneer recently who said that even though many potential house purchasers have secure jobs, they cannot secure loans.  Until that happens, ordinary people will be unable to spend like they have been asked to do by the Minister for Finance.  One cannot spend what one does not have.  That is what happened us.  We spent what we did not have wildly, crazily and flamboyantly and now ordinary people, not speculators and investors, are paying the price.Amendments to the legislation are badly needed because there are gaping holes in it.  The greatest gaping hole is people cannot understand that senior bondholders are not even being singed, never mind burned.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  A resolution procedure for financial institutions should always have been an important part of the armoury of the Central Bank and the Government for dealing with financial institutions, even if was never needed.  It is amazing that such a procedure was never put in place, particularly given that a number of institutions crashed in the 1980s.  It has taken the banking crisis of the past three years and the intervention of the IMF and the ECB to ensure a resolution procedure will be put in place.I welcome the provisions in the Bill to ensure the State will have mechanisms available to take over the operation of failing institutions.  In 2009 the IMF stated that "...keeping afloat failed banks and making good their losses is unjustifiable, because it ultimately transfers commercial losses to the taxpayer, validates poor bank management...".  Given this comment, it is amazing that the IMF proceeded in 2010 to force a bailout agreement on the Irish people, which puts all the bank losses on the taxpayer and places us under a huge burden to repay the losses of the banking system that have come to light over the past few years.  These losses are not the responsibility of the people or the Government and they should not be taken on by the people or the Government acting on their behalf.Opposition Deputies have constantly stated there is a need for burden sharing and for bondholders to carry their losses.  They were speculators who invested in these businesses, which failed, and they should take their losses.  That is the correct and mature way to deal with financial institutions.  We have constantly said that we need to default on these loans, burden share and burn the bondholders.  I am glad the Government has taken this on board to some extent in regard to unsecured bondholders in AIB by moving to force burden sharing on them.  That demonstrates the arguments we made were appropriate and sensible and the Government has acted on them.  The ratings agencies have registered this as a default incident and, therefore, the State has started to default on the bondholders.  The Government should work harder in this regard and move up the value chain to force burden sharing on bondholders to comply with the IMF statement not to ultimately transfer commercial losses to the taxpayer.The taxpayer is carrying the losses of all the banks and bonds are being paid.  Senior bondholders will be repaid in the coming days, weeks and months by the Government with taxpayers' money borrowed at exorbitant interest rates from the very people who said we should not put these losses on the taxpayer.  However, that is what the Government will continue to do.Other Members have referred to cutbacks throughout the economy and, in particular, in the education sector in recent days.  School children will not have transport next September and some who are badly in need of them will not have SNAs.  I received a call from a Montessori school in County Donegal earlier.  An autistic child will be sent to the school next September but the school has been refused an SNA.  That is an example of the impact of this crazy policy the Government is pursuing in ensuring all senior bondholders get paid.  Everybody who gambled and put money into the banks will get paid while school children will lose out on SNAs and transport, social welfare rates will be slashed in the budget and the low paid will be forced to carry the burden.  The Government needs to continue with the burden sharing it has engaged in with AIB's unsubordinated debt holders and move up the value chain because that will resolve our problems within the State.I commend the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on its comprehensive digest, which provides a great deal of information on the legislation.  There were discussions in 2008 within the Department of Finance and Central Bank about introducing a resolution Bill but it was shelved because officials were afraid it would spook the markets.  However, they were spooked at that stage and money was flowing out of Anglo Irish Bank in particular.  This led to the crisis and the crazy guarantee in September 2008.The Bill provides for four conditions that need to be satisfied before the Central Bank can intervene to force a resolution on an institution.  Two of the conditions are subjective and the regulator and the Central Bank can decide whether they have been met.  They should be tightened up and the subjectivity removed.  The reports into the banking crisis have highlighted that the regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance failed to see what was coming down the tracks and they did not act.  If too much subjectivity attaches to the conditions provided for in the Bill, the groundwork will be laid for further failures down the road.  We must ensure that the conditions in the Bill are clear and if they are not met, a reaction is triggered quickly without subjectivity.  Otherwise, the banks could bring undue pressure to bear.  If we get to the situation again where we have a weak regulator or Central Bank, or a Department of Finance that is not capable of dealing with the situation, then the financial institutions can place undue pressure on them and delay their reactions to the conditions that are developing in those institutions.  This could have catastrophic effects if they do not react quickly enough and implement the measures needed to ensure the wind up of these institutions, or at least have them taken under control, so that losses can be mitigated.I look forward to seeing ministerial amendments on Committee Stage, and to teasing out this Bill in greater detail.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill, the need for which has become patently and painfully obvious over the past few years.  It was brought about after the tragic events we have seen in banking over the past few years, which include the colossal losses to the country, to individuals and the fall in the perception of Ireland as a modern economy throughout the European Union and further afield.  It is appalling that we should find ourselves at this juncture due to the failure of certain institutions charged with responsibility for doing a job which they obviously did not take too seriously.  This happened in spite of the fact that it was clearly laid down for them that in order to pursue good banking practice, it was necessary to have certain regulations in place.When the DIRT inquiry concluded in 1999 or 2000, certain regulations were put in place in respect of the responsibilities of financial institutions.  These included how to go about their business, how to be accountable, how to regulate their business, how to ensure good fiduciary practice, and how they were supposed to have regular audits by independent auditors who were not supposed to have carried out audits in the previous seven years.  They were charged with the responsibility to ensure that good governance was seen to be put into operation and to be working.  None of that happened.  Unfortunately, what happened and what slowly unfolded on an unwitting public was the total collapse of the system that was put in place.  Every single precept put in place was ignored.Who is to blame?  Everybody looks for somebody to blame nowadays.  I do not know who is to blame, but I do know that responsibilities were thrust upon three different sectors.  I will not go into detail on them right now, but if they all did the job they were charged with at that time, there would be no necessity to bring this Bill before the House all these years later.  The situation in which this country finds itself, something that unfolded over the past three or four years, was easily visible to the ordinary man and woman in the street.  They were all talking about it.  They were seeing that things could not last.  Where were we going?  When would the bubble burst?  When would the steam escape from the system?  Unfortunately, a number of people charged with responsibility in various institutions did not live up to expectations.  They did not live up to their responsibilities.  I do not know what distracted them, but they were distracted and the result has been a catastrophe for the country, the economy and the people.The people of this country now have to carry the responsibility of repaying the debt that arises from the madness that was pursued over a number of years.  Legislation was put in place to ensure that this madness did not happen.  We put a regulatory authority and a Governor of the Central Bank in place.  These things are not rocket science; they are simple.  Any traditional banker could explain to any of us what should have been done at particular times over the past few years, and asked the question why it was not done and what should happen afterwards.I am concerned with the latter part of that.  What should happen afterwards?  What disciplinary action should take place?  Should we just pass it off as if nothing happened, or should those who did not do their job be forced to take responsibility for their actions?  They did not do their job.  Why did the people charged with responsibility not raise the red flag?  Why did they not arrest the downhill speed of the economy at the time?  Their function was not to call each other up and say "How are you going there?"  That is not the job of a regulator or a Governor of the Central Bank.  That is not the job of a member of any institution charged with the responsibilities of banking and its wider implications for the economy.What is likely to happen now?  Will we just walk away?  This is a small country and there are those who say that no law was broken.  Laws were broken and that is a fact.  Company law was broken.  We went through the companies Bill for 18 months with a fine tooth comb to ensure that everything was in place, that people could be held accountable for their actions, and that they did their job in accordance with the legislation as laid down.  I do not know what happened along the way.  I do not know why we suddenly came to a situation where irresponsibility was to take over.The only conclusion we can make is that the pickings were so good and the aspirations so high, it was deemed that it could go on forever.  There would be no change and nothing would ever stop that mad rush to the top of the mountain, or the bottom of the pit, as the case may be.  Nobody seemed to know where they were going.  These people were charged with specific responsibilities that they did not honour.  There is no use in avoiding that fact.  Everybody knew their responsibilities and what they were supposed to do at different times over the past eight to ten years, when the indications were there to the effect that the economy was not going in the right direction, that the financial institutions were not lending wisely, that people were not borrowing wisely and that the sums of money were far out of reach in this economy and likely to lead us into a very serious situation.  Why did those particular safeguards not kick in?  I do not know, but I would like to know.  As we do not know and as we move on and legislate for this kind of eventuality, I believe that we could arrive at a similar situation in the future.  That would be a woeful catastrophe.I welcome this Bill.  I am so sad that I was in this House during the period that the necessity for this Bill became patently obvious, but it would never make any difference if the people charged with that responsibility did not live up to their task.  The same applies again.  If the people given the responsibility for doing specific jobs do not do so after this, then nothing will have been achieved and we will be back to square one.  The laissez-faire attitude that prevailed in recent years will continue.  What will happens if those charged with those responsibilities in the relevant institutions do not fulfil their duties in future?  Will they run off to another jurisdiction?  Will they speak to us from abroad or write in the newspapers, telling us they did nothing wrong and broke no law?  Will we, as legislators, be left with the responsibility of conveying that message to the Irish people?  That would be a sad situation.This is not a criticism of the legislation before us or the previous legislation, wherein provision was made to ensure that the things that happened would not happen and if they were visible, they would be visible to those with responsibility long before becoming a serious threat to the economy.  We have learned a harsh lesson and I hope those now charged with the new responsibilities will observe to the letter and the spirit the legislation as set down and will do their jobs without fear or favour or hindrance.  If they do not, we will back where we started.What were the European lending institutions, which had responsibility in respect of borrowing and lending and good practice, doing?  Who reported to them?  If they were given information, what action did they take and did they take it in time?  I am not sure.  I remember in this House as far back as 2002 people asking questions about where we were heading.  Anyone who asked such stupid questions was told to sit down and shut up because he did not know what he was talking about.  Some European institutions, such as the Commission, raised questions but we had in place banking institutions throughout Europe with particular regulations for the eurozone.  There were departures from the guidelines that were laid down, however, with many countries to a greater or lesser extent sidestepping the Growth and Stability Pact guidelines because it suited them and they benefited from that.  That it happened should have warned the institutions that something was happening that was not provided for and, as a result, it could lead to serious difficulties later on.That was exactly what happened and everyone all of a sudden knew the fat was in the fire, the whole thing was imploding and we should have seen it beforehand.There is a lesson to be learned for the European institutions, that regulations are fine when they are drawn up provided they are observed.  When too much freedom is given, and too much of a carnival attitude is allowed to prevail, it may work for a while, but it must be remembered that when it began to collapse, the system fragmented overnight.I would not allow this occasion to pass without directing criticism at those European institutions which should have known what was going to happen and should have kept a stricter eye on what was happening in this and other European countries.  There will always be those who say we are all the same, that everyone is doing it.  I do not believe in that maxim; I believe smaller, open economies find themselves much more vulnerable than the bigger countries with bigger economies and consumer bases.Have those European institutions decided how the European financial structures will operate in future?  Recently we have seen people speaking out on the issue but I am not sure the European treaties we passed, particularly the Lisbon treaty, gave carte blanche to everyone in the European Union to speak out.  It was specifically laid down that only certain people in the Commission and the Council of Ministers would have the influence to speak on behalf of the EU and its institutions.  It grieved me greatly to see on a number of occasions people being choreographed at European level to give an opinion that any assistance sought by this country would not be considered because it was in violation of certain other regulations.  If those regulations had been applied properly in the first place, we would not be where we are now.There is a lesson to be learned from this.  Responsibility falls to everyone, particularly in banking.  Those of us who have been around for a while have been through a number of recessions.  Sometimes I feel my whole life has been one long recession because there was never any abundance of funds at any time.  In the 1920s and 1930s there was an international crash, and the same happened in the 1840s.  Those experiences gave rise to regulations that led to good banking practice.  Simple guidelines were laid down for lending and borrowing and these were tried and tested over the years.  They were proven by the test of time but they were not quick enough for the modern expert, who with the advance of IT saw a need to make profit more quickly.  Sadly, we now find ourselves at a juncture that is a lesson for all such people in future.I wish this legislation well and I hope it works.  I hope the people on whom responsibility will fall as a result of the passage of this legislation will do their job in a forthright fashion without fear or favour, and if they do not do their job they will have to pay a price because we cannot have a repeat performance of what we have currently.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011.  The publication of this Bill is a commitment under the EU-IMF deal.  The Bill provides the Central Bank with additional powers to achieve an effective resolution regime for credit institutions that are failing or are likely to fail, with the objective of protecting the Exchequer and the stability of the financial system of the economy.It is important that we have such an item of legislation because for too long people were not facing up to the issue of financial institutions failing.  It has taken us a number of years to come around to the realisation that because an institution is a financial institution it is not a sacred cow and no commercial organisation should be too big to fail in any country or here in Ireland.  People have been afraid to deal with the concept of a big failure and rather than deal with the consequences of a big failure we put the issue on the long finger and put guarantees and protection around them through the arm of the State in the hope that in due course they would not ultimately fail but as we know some of them were failed institutions at the time they got various guarantees.  Most people accept that the Government did not know they were failed institutions at that time and it is a moot point as to whether the people who were running those organisations, the directors, knew they were dealing with insolvency rather than liquidity issues.  That is something we will have to get to the bottom of ultimately because if they were insolvent, and the directors and senior executives had a fiduciary duty to know the state of the organisation of which they were directors, they would be guilty of fraudulent trading as they were continuing to run a business that was insolvent, take on commitments and take people's money when they knew they were insolvent.  If they did not know, they should have known.  That is an issue about which people feel very cross.  People ask about the law they broke and say they might have made a misjudgment but in most organisations that principle would come into it.  At best they are guilty of reckless trading and most people would say at this stage that in view of the scale of the difficulties that have emerged, what happened was far worse than reckless trading.  In my opinion it was fraudulent trading.The legislation before the House is an update on previous legislation passed here before Christmas last year.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, said that the Bill seeks to ensure that the Central Bank is empowered to promptly and effectively resolve distressed institutions when, for example, they pose a risk to financial stability.  The Bill proposes a permanent special resolution regime for the credit institutions whose key tools are listed as a transfer order, a special management order allowing for the establishment of a bridge-bank, a modified liquidation process, and the development of recovery and resolution plans.  That will lead on to what I consider to be possibly one of the fundamental structural weaknesses in this legislation which I will deal with off and on as I make my contribution.  Notwithstanding that particular criticism, we support the Bill because it is necessary that we have a system in place, and other countries are developing resolution mechanisms to deal with banks and financial institutions in danger of failing.The principal problem I have with this measure is that we are giving too much authority to the Central Bank.  Previously, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had a great deal of authority but they are only two individual institutions.  In the past those individual institutions, and we are all on record in this regard, were not doing their job.  They were asleep at the wheel, so to speak.  We will not revisit that now but what I am most concerned about is that in a few years from now, and we have been in the eye of the storm for the past two years, when hopefully the economy picks up and the emphasis moves off this area, how competent will the people who have yet to be employed in those key posts be in their jobs?  They will have enormous powers and will be one arm removed from the Government but the Government will not have sufficient control over them.  Can we be guaranteed that these people will be able to do their job into the future?  That is not a criticism of the current incumbents but there is no guarantee that future incumbents in those posts will always act as scrupulously and as diligently as the current incumbents are doing.That leads me to my basic criticism of this legislation and all similar legislation we have passed in this House.  I have said here previously that we must look at the big picture.  This is a European wide and international problem.  People are saying we are helping to bail out Europe.  This is a European issue and the time has come to consider whether each of the 27 countries in the EU should have their own domestic central bank.  We have a European Central Bank.  We will be in a situation here where all the key banking and financial institutions will be completely controlled by the State.  Bank of Ireland will probably be the only bank not substantially controlled by the State and the question arises of Ireland having a Central Bank to manage what are non-commercial semi-State bodies, as I would call the banks that are operating in the country with the benefit of the Irish taxpayer.  They could not be called commercial institutions; they are non-commercial because of the financial support they must get.Part of the problem is that the banks, and I refer to Anglo Irish Bank and AIB in their heyday, were too big to be managed and regulated by the Irish Central Bank.  They were based in one office.  I am certain that part of the problem was that they were almost in awe of the success of the big banks.  Their profits were going up year in, year out.  Their business and lending was increasing.  They were sending in the reports but the reports were being put on shelves and they did not dare question them.  I believe they were intimidated by them.  That can happen in other European countries.  Having 27 small central banks across the EU is not a good recipe for the future.That goes back to a point I made here previously.  There are 17 countries in the eurozone but when we set up the euro that was what I would call the front of house part of the overall regime where people had the currency in their pockets for dealing with day to day basis but we print notes and mint the coins in the 27 countries.  We have one common currency but we do not have one central bank with sufficient control at European level.  We need a bank with the financial power, size and scale of the European Central Bank to be able to regulate banks operating in the various countries throughout the EU.  Ultimately, the European Central Bank calls most of the shots in these areas but it is only a bank of that scale that has the authority and the power and that will not be intimidated, side-tracked or put off course the way a local central bank would be, as happened in the past, which is one of the reasons we are here today.It might be an unusual call to give more powers at European level but I and most Irish people have lost confidence in the Irish Central Bank and the Irish financial regulatory system.  We have some new people in place but there is more to dealing with the problem than that.  We are building up an armoury of legislation.What we are doing in this Bill is essential but it is only a sticking plaster in that we are only dealing with the small problem before us.  How will this measure operate if the Central Bank wanted to move on one of the State controlled banks?

It is a great honour and privilege to assume the office of Minister and to carry executive responsibility on behalf of the public in a ministerial capacity.  I wish her success in her new role.I commend the Government on promoting the ministry to a full Cabinet position.  That is a positive development and builds on progress in recent years.  I hope it will lead to priority, protection and services for the country's children to assure they get the best possible start in life, as befitting the capacity of our Republic.For a number of years Fianna Fáil has advocated a constitutional amendment on the rights of the child.  The two adoption provisions being presented in the Bill were first included in the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2007 which was introduced by our late colleague, former deputy leader of the party, and Minister, Brian Lenihan.  I pay tribute to his Trojan work and pioneering efforts in promoting the enshrinement of children's rights in the Constitution.The strong position accorded to the family in the Constitution, in conjunction with the fact there is no provision in the Constitution for children to be adopted has resulted in thousands of children spending their entire childhood years in foster care without the right to be adopted by their new family.  The purpose of the Twenty-Ninth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill is to ensure that the best interests of a child should be the primary consideration to be weighed against the rights of marital parents and the provisions of Article 42.5, thus allowing some children the opportunity of a stable and secure family life which is currently not available to them.The amendment forms part of the new Article 42(A).  The Bill states that:Provision may be made by law for the adoption of a child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law in their responsibility towards the child, and where the best interests of the child so require.Provision may be made by law for the voluntary placement for adoption, and the adoption, of any child.Adoption is currently dealt with by law, and is not referred to in the Constitution.  The 1952 Act was intended to deal with the adoption of children born outside marriage.  However, over the years a number of situations emerged where it could be in the best interests of children of marriage to be adopted.  Examples of these situations include children, one of whose natural parents has died, and the other parent marries again.  The new parent has no rights in terms of giving agreement to treatment in illness, signing a passport or other applications, or signing forms of a day-to-day nature, for example, for school purposes.  Another category relates to children who have been in long-term foster care.  Some children go into foster care at a very young age and grow up as part of their foster family, in some cases using the name of the foster family.  There is no possibility of their return to the birth family, but they cannot become a legal part of their new family.  Another category relates to where parents have failed to care for a child and they have been in the care of the State for a substantial period.  A further category relates to children whose parent has a long-term illness or disability where the parent wishes the child to be placed for adoption.  An additional category concerns children who have been placed for adoption but whose parents subsequently marry.In view of the above types of case, the Adoption Act 1988, provided for the adoption of children including children of marriage.  However, the Bill was referred to the Supreme Court by the President, in light of the place of the marital family in the Constitution.  The Supreme Court found that the Bill was constitutional but set out very limited circumstances in which children of marriage could be adopted, including that it must be proved that the failure of duty by marital parents is likely to extend until the child is 18 and must amount to complete abandonment.  Minimal contact from parents has been interpreted as showing that this has not taken place which makes it almost impossible for a child with married parents to be adopted.The amendment to the Constitution would empower the Oireachtas to introduce legislation to allow for the adoption of children in long-term care if it is in their best interests.  Before a referendum is put to the people a White Paper or legislation will be required.  The Department must outline what exactly will be introduced should the referendum pass.  It will be necessary to set out what the exact requirements will be and what threshold will have to be met before it is possible for a child in foster care to be adopted.  Currently, in Britain the waiting period is one year, which is very short.  Fianna Fáil suggests a period of five years before a child can go for adoption after being placed into care.  I urge the Minister to prepare a Bill to cater for the possibility of adoption for children in care between now and the presidential election in October or November.  There is adequate time for that to happen because this is the first of the referenda Bills which the Government plans to present to the electorate during the presidential election.  By taking the Bill now there will be time for the Minister to bring forward a White Paper or legislation on the issue.  Preparatory work was done by the previous Minister for children, former Deputy Barry Andrews.  I have no doubt the Minister will be able to progress the issue.The Bill affirms the right of all children to be adopted regardless of the marital status of their parents but, most importantly, it does so without interfering with the primacy of the family under the Constitution.  At present, there are more than 6,000 children in care, 5,500 of whom are in foster care, which is approximately 90%, and one third of those children are in long-term foster care.  In some cases, children are taken into care at birth and raised by foster parents and may only have sporadic contact with their parents.  The possibility of adoption would represent a chance for a stable and secure family life, which is something every child deserves.As the Chief Justice, Mr John Murray, outlined in his introduction to "Child Law — 2nd Edition" by Geoffrey Shannon, "Adoption into a family, where circumstances so warrant, has always been considered superior to other options such as care in State institutions".  The fact that one third of children in foster care are in long-term care is way out of kilter with the situation in other countries.  That statistic indicates the problem that exists for children moving from foster care into adoptive care.  Given the high threshold that is required to be met in order for an adoption to proceed, children are opting to seek adoption when they are 17 years of age, just short of their 18th birthday, in order to get the rights afforded to them by adoption.  The reason there are so many cases in that category is because it is nearly impossible for them to meet the criteria any younger than that.This referendum Bill is very much needed.  The reason we are taking the step of introducing a referendum Bill is in part due to the U-turn by the new Government on its commitment to run the proposed children's rights referendum at the same time as the presidential election.  As recently as early February, just three weeks before election day, the new Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, promised to hold the children's rights referendum on the same day as the presidential election.  However, he and the new Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have now abandoned this promise, saying there will be no referendum until some time next year.  The Government's position is that it now wishes to spend further time examining the wording for a referendum on children.Fianna Fáil has supported, and continues to support, the need for a wider referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  However, the Government's delaying on this and its breach of election promises is not acceptable.  Measures to improve the rights of children are not a political football that can be bounced in order to win votes during an election campaign only to be dropped as soon as a party gains power.This referendum Bill deals only with the adoption aspects of the proposed children's rights referendum, on which there is widespread consensus.  It is our position that hundreds of children cannot be asked to continue in foster care without the right to be adopted into families that are ready, willing and anxious to provide them with the loving and supportive environment they deserve.  It is simply not acceptable that those children and families who are waiting for this change are forced to wait another year or longer because the Government has backed away from its election pledge.  Both the new Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have said that the children's referendum is a complex matter.  Of that there is little doubt.  One needs only to think about the abortion referendums of the early 1980s to see the problems that arise when amendments to the Constitution are not fully thought through and are poorly worded.  All of this shows that the position of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in Opposition was purely political.  On the very day that the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children issued its third and final report, the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, demanded that the then Government name a date for the referendum.  This was before the Cabinet had even received a copy of the report, let alone had time to consider the proposed wording.Since taking office, the current Taoiseach and Minister have placed great store in the advice of the Attorney General, as they are duty-bound to do.  To do otherwise would be highly irresponsible.  However, practically every day on the Order of Business in the last Dáil, the current Taoiseach and Tánaiste berated the last Government for its failure to name a date for the referendum.  Little credence was given to replies that the Attorney General had to consider the wording, as did the various Departments.  According to the current Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, there was across-the-board political consensus on the wording proposed by the joint committee, and hence no need to consult with anyone; all that needed to be done was to name a date for a referendum.  It was stated that every day the Government procrastinated, the children of the country were being denied their inalienable rights.The former Government took the steps necessary to ensure that the wording to be put to the people would not give rise to consequences that were not envisaged by the joint committee.  Various concerns were identified, such as the prospect of impinging on immigration policy and the issue of legal representation in administrative proceedings concerning children.  Although I was not a member of the joint committee, I do not believe it was its intent to introduce a range of socio-economic rights into the Constitution.The wording approved by the last Government was shared with Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin as well as the Ombudsman for Children and NGOs dealing with children.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Barry Andrews, proposed to hold the referendum on the day of the general election.  As we know, the general election was called sooner than anticipated and that jettisoned any prospect of holding the referendum on the same day.  Many inside and some outside the House suggested that the original timeframe was too tight and that the ideal time to hold the referendum was on the day of the presidential election.  Little did anyone expect that the issue would be pushed out to 2012, at the earliest, by the new Government.The new Minister said only last Thursday that she wishes to revert to the wording proposed by the joint committee.  Although she has all the legal advice from the last Attorney General at her disposal, she wishes to discount it.  I ask whether she has yet sought a view from the new Attorney General as to whether she concurs with her predecessor.  Has she expressed any view on the matter?  The House is entitled to know where it stands, well after the Government's first 100 days in office.  Although I think it highly unlikely, should the Attorney General express the view that the wording proposed by the joint committee should be contained in a new referendum Bill, we as a party would be willing to consider such a proposal.  The consensus built in the joint committee was hard-won and should not be dispensed with lightly.  However, I cannot but think that the wording that is eventually proposed some time next year, to use the Minister's own words, will not greatly differ from the proposal that was put on the table by the then Minister of State last January.It is the Government's right and prerogative to review all versions of the wording.  I would expect nothing else.  However, we are entitled to ask about the timeline and the process by which the Minister will examine the wording.  Does she propose to share any new thinking with the Oireachtas?Some may legitimately ask why we are proposing to put the adoption provisions contained in all previous forms of the wording in a separate referendum.  The answer is straightforward.  It is not fair to ask the thousand children who are currently in long-term foster care and do not have the option of proceeding to adoption with a new family to wait.  There is absolute political consensus on the wording of the two adoption provisions.  The matter took up relatively little time in the joint committee and there has been no straying from the original wording proposed by the late Brian Lenihan in 2007.There is no doubt that the eventual children's rights referendum will be hard-fought, and despite cross-party agreement and support, there is no guarantee it will be passed by the people.  Should a proposal be put to the people only to be rejected, all of the Bill will fall, including the adoption provisions.  In that event, the children I have spoken about tonight, the children in long-term foster care who cannot be adopted, and possibly the next generation of children in care, will not be eligible for adoption.  One thing is sure: if a children's referendum is defeated, it will be a long time before the matter will be revisited, regardless of the shape of future Governments.  That is reason enough to seriously consider running this referendum on the same day as the presidential election.  This is a Bill that is much needed and it makes eminent sense to run the referendum alongside the upcoming presidential election.Fianna Fáil continues to support the need for a wider referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  We will work with the Minister and other parties on that.  However, the issue of adoption rights is not contentious and enjoys widespread support.  My question to the Government is this: why would we make a single child in need of a loving home wait another year, if not more?  This anomaly can be fixed now.  Our Bill can be accepted tonight without compromise of principle on anyone's behalf.Tonight, the Dáil can send a strong and clear message to these children and the families that want to provide them with a supportive home.  Some issues are too important to delay upon, and this is one of them.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I commend my party colleague Deputy McConalogue on presenting this Bill to the House, as it affords us the opportunity to highlight the importance of adoption and the continuing need to make progress on the wider issue of children's rights.  Last year, adoption was very much to the forefront in respect of the concerns of prospective parents wishing to adopt from Vietnam.  I had many discussions with the then Minister responsible, Barry Andrews, because a significant number of families in Wexford were affected by the suspension of inter-country adoptions from Vietnam.  This Bill focuses primarily on Irish children, many of whom are in long-term foster care.  While the two avenues of adoption are distinct, there are inherent linkages.Ireland has one of the highest rates of inter-country adoption in Europe.  With our troubled history of sending children abroad for adoption in the 1950s and 1960s, it seems odd that prospective Irish adoptive parents now look to abroad to adopt.  In many cases, they do so because there are so few Irish children available for domestic adoption.  This in itself is a good development because Irish parents are now caring for their children rather than placing them for adoption.  In the past, the stigma attached to unwanted pregnancies meant that children were born in secret and placed for adoption in very distressing circumstances.  Only this week, the HSE crisis pregnancy programme, formerly the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, claimed one third of pregnancies were crisis pregnancies.  Thankfully, few of these babies will end up being placed for adoption.There is a cohort of Irish children, however, who would be eligible for adoption in other jurisdictions.  Those are children in long-term foster care who, because of the legislative and constitutional threshold, cannot enjoy the security of a second family.  Due to the constitutional position of the family, it is nigh impossible for children of married parents to be placed for adoption, regardless of obvious failings in their duty of care for the child.  At a Legal Aid Board conference in Dublin last week, a leading expert in infant mental health, Mr. Robin Balbernie, clinical head of infant mental health services in Britain, stated vulnerable children should be taken into care in the first six months of life if the best outcome is to be achieved.  Neglect of infants rather than physical abuse, he claimed, was more likely to lead them to be dysfunctional and violent adults.  In Ireland, however, when these children are taken into care, they are often denied the opportunity to be adopted.  Instead, they may face a childhood of long-term foster care.Ireland is unique in this regard.  In other jurisdictions, children do not spend years in long-term foster care.  In the UK, for example, children are eligible for adoption after they have spent 12 months in care.  Many believe this is too short a time.  We suggest children should be placed with a foster family for five years before they could be considered eligible for adoption.  A bizarre situation currently exists in which some children are only being placed for adoption at the age of 17 or 17 and a half years.  Children should not have to spend 17 years in care or wait until six months before they reach 18 before an application for adoption is made.  The reason behind this is that both birth parents must fail in their duty to the child until the child reaches the age of 18.  For some, the only way this test can be passed is to make the application on the verge of the 18th birthday.  Some foster parents will adopt the child, even at this late stage, to confer inheritance and other rights on the child.  In some cases, it is so the child can use the foster parents' surname for the rest of their lives.  This Bill provides that these children can be adopted as children, not as young people on the verge of adulthood.Fianna Fáil has brought forward this Private Members' Bill to run a constitutional referendum on adoption alongside the forthcoming presidential election.  The Bill will allow for the adoption of hundreds of children currently in long-term care and who cannot be adopted because of rules arising from the current position of the family in the Constitution.  Fianna Fáil has taken the step of introducing this referendum Bill in response to the U-turn by the new Government on its commitment to run the proposed children's rights referendum alongside the presidential election.  Will the Minister indicate when the Government intends to have this referendum?  This Fianna Fáil Bill could be accepted by the Government without any compromise of any party's principles.The Twenty-Ninth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill 2011 deals with the adoption of children in cases of parental failure and adoption of children of marriage.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the best interests of a child should be the primary consideration to be weighed against the rights of marital parents and the provisions of Article 42.5, thus allowing some children the opportunity of a stable and secure family life, currently not available to them.  It states:Provision may be made by law for the adoption of a child where the parents have failed for such a period of time as may be prescribed by law in their responsibility towards the child, and where the best interests of the child so require.  Provision may also be made by law for the voluntary placement for adoption, and the adoption, of any child.Adoption is dealt with by law and not referred to in the Constitution.  The 1952 Adoption Act was intended to deal with adoption of children born outside marriage.  Several situations have emerged over the years where it could be in the best interests of children of marriage to be adopted.  This amendment to the Constitution will empower the Oireachtas to bring in legislation to allow for the adoption of children in long-term care if it is in the child's best interests.  It affirms the right of all children to be adopted regardless of the marital status of their parents.  Most importantly, it does so without interfering with the primacy of the family under the Constitution.As Deputy Charlie McConalogue pointed out earlier, more than 6,000 children are in care, 5,500 of whom are in foster care and one third in long-term foster care.  In some cases, children are taken into care at birth, raised by foster parents and may only have sporadic contact from their parents.  The possibility of adoption would represent a chance for a stable and secure family life, something that every child deserves.  The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice John Murray, has stated, "Adoption into a family, where circumstances so warrant, has always been considered superior to other options such as care in State institutions."  This Bill has been brought forward because the Government parties have reneged on the commitments made in Opposition to proceed immediately with a referendum on children's rights if elected to office.In January 2010 when negotiations with Vietnam on a new bilateral agreement were suspended in light of various concerns raised by international reports, the then Opposition parties called for a resumption of adoptions with Vietnam.  It was always intended that adoptions would resume with Vietnam once both countries had ratified the Hague Convention.  Ireland has done so by way of the Adoption Act 2010.  Vietnam is expected to do so later this year.A delegation from the Adoption Authority recently visited Vietnam and submitted a report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on progress being made there.  She, however, still has not briefed the House on the contents of that report, although she outlined some of its facts on "Today with Pat Kenny" recently.  Will she give a more up-to-date outline of the report to the House?I know several families in County Wexford who were hoping to adopt Vietnamese children because they saw how successful other Vietnamese adoptions were.  Many of these adopted Vietnamese children have adapted well to their new homes in Wexford, even playing football and hurling locally.  They may even improve the quality of Wexford hurling in the future.  We must encourage the Vietnamese authorities to sign up to the Hague Convention as soon as possible.

When introducing constitutional referenda, we must ensure there are no unintended consequences.  There was the famous case of the so-called abortion referendum — the right to life referendum — which led to unforeseen consequences.  There was also a need for a follow-up referendum in respect of the Good Friday Agreement because what appeared to be a quite normal and amiable form of words gave rise to unforeseen difficulties.When we were in government, we considered the issue of children's rights.  Everyone wants to vindicate those rights.  We examined the wording put forward by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The then Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, was concerned about the possible effects this wording might have and that it might give rise to unintended consequences.  This is a complicated matter and I am of the view that the Government should take time to consider the wider children's rights issue.  If it is not disposed to accept the wording drawn up by the previous Attorney General, and if it is determined to adopt the original wording put forward, it should give careful consideration to whether the difficulties Mr. Gallagher identified in respect of the latter wording might come to pass.  We should move forward in a steady manner and the matter to which I refer should be examined carefully on a stand-alone basis.The position with regard to adoption is clear.  It is not for me to state that their lordships in the Supreme Court got it wrong.  When I read the Irish version of the Constitution, however, I find it difficult to understand how they ever reached the conclusion that it is only in extremely limited circumstances that the children of a marriage might be adopted.  The Irish version of the Constitution refers to "do chearta nádúrtha dochloíte an linbh".  In the English version this is translated as "the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child".  Use of the term "dochloíte" means that these are rights which cannot be taken away.  In my humble opinion this indicates that the child must always come first.It is difficult to see how what is stated in the Constitution was perceived as being a vindication of the institution of marriage, which is a broad and sweeping concept.  The premise is that marriage cannot be abolished and that the institution must be supported because of the nature of its effect on society.  When the great jump is then made to a position where if a child's welfare is placed against the institution of marriage — particularly in the context of the exceptional cases to which the Constitution refers — I cannot understand how the 1988 legislation was ruled to be too generous in respect of this matter and that it was necessary to adopt a very confined interpretation.I have always believed the Constitution to be a document written not only for lawyers but also for ordinary people.  In other words, it is meant to be capable of being understood by the latter.  It is strange, therefore, that under the interpretation handed down by the Supreme Court in respect of the Constitution — and regardless of how difficult or exceptional might be the circumstances involved — it is practically impossible to adopt children from a marital situation.  I cannot understand how this can be reconciled with the "chearta nádúrtha dochloíte an linbh" or "natural and imprescriptible rights of the child" to which the Constitution refers.  My attitude is that if this is the nature of the Supreme Court's ruling, then so be it.  However, I do not believe that is what was envisioned by the ordinary people when they voted in favour of the Constitution.  The simple answer is, therefore, that we should put matters right.  There is a good argument to the effect that it should never have taken us this long to address this issue and that it should now be dealt with forthwith.Not incorporating all the changes to the Constitution in one article gives rise to certain advantages.  If, for example, arguments and difficulties arose in respect of the second proposed wording, not all would be lost if a particular question were rejected by the people.  In other words, if one all-encompassing question were put in a referendum, there is a danger that everything would be lost.  It makes sense, therefore, to move forward with this non-contentious item of legislation and put it before the people.  I will be interested in hearing what the Minister has to say but I believe that, on a stand-alone basis, she will probably find no fault with the Bill.Given that a referendum commission must be established and that it is not possible to run a referendum overnight — it is proper that there should be a good lead-in period to referenda — I ask the Government to reconsider whether it should accept the proposal contained in the Bill.  I have no doubt that there would be all-party agreement in that regard.  The Government could then return to tease out the more complex issues with which it is trying to deal.  In light of the fact that this is a complex matter, I have no doubt that if it engages in such a process the Government will be presented with ample wordings and plenty of arguments from various lawyers.  In such circumstances, the Minister's head will be "done in" as she tries to consider whether every angle has been examined in the context of the consequences to which a change to the Constitution might give rise.The then Attorney General was of the opinion that the 1988 legislation was constitutional but the Supreme Court adopted a different view.  That shows how it is possible for unintended consequences to arise.  Even eminent lawyers can different on particular matters.  In 1988 the then Attorney General must have been satisfied that the relevant legislation was constitutional.We tend to discuss undoing the past a great deal.  To a certain extent we can try to ameliorate the damage that was done but we cannot undo the past.  On each occasion a debate on that matter is begun, I always ask the question "What about the present?"  We can do something about what is happening today and what will happen tomorrow.  We can cater for the interests of children now rather than in 20 or 30 years asking why we did not take action in order to give children in long-term foster care the type of stable homes they require.  Is it not much better to do something rather than in the future being asked why one did not act?  It is good to break large problems down into their constituent parts.  If there is a part which might be easily tackled and which is stand alone in nature, I cannot understand why we cannot just proceed to tackle it.  We could then tease out the more complex and difficult parts and take action once consideration has been given to every eventuality.The other issue relating to children should be dealt with.  There is a massive debate taking place about how far the Government might resile from the previous Attorney General's proposal to the proposal put forward by the joint committee, the point at which any wording should be included in the Constitution, whether the rights to be granted should be justiciable, etc.  I am aware that, regardless of how quickly one might wish to proceed, careful consideration is required in respect of this matter.Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta McConalogue, as ucht an mBille seo a thabhairt os comhair an Tí.  Tá súil agam go smaoineoidh an Rialtas ar seo thar oíche agus go bhfeicfidh sé nach ceist pháirtí í ar chor ar bith.

Mar sin, tá súil agam, nuair a dhéanfaidh an tAire a macnamh ar an Bhille anocht, go bhfeicfidh sí nach bhfuil muid ag imirt polaitíochta leis seo — cinnte, níl mise.Táim ag impí ar an Aire glacadh leis an Bhille mar is ar son ghasúr na tíre é.  Ba cheart glacadh leis agus dul ar aghaidh leis.  Nuair a bheidh an tAire réidh leis an chuid eile den obair atá le déanamh aici ar son páistí na tíre seo, ba cheart sin a dhéanamh in am tráth agus focail eile agus leasaithe eile a chur os ár gcomhair le déileáil leis an obair sin.  Ach idir an dá linn, ní cheist chonspóideach í uchtú gasúr.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne in aghaidh gasúir a uchtú.  Mholfainn don Aire agus iarraim uirthi glacadh leis an leasú bunreachta seo.

I wish to comment on the sensitivity and concern that has been shown by the speakers who have already spoken on the motion regarding the position of those children in foster care who cannot be adopted.  This is an issue that has been little understood over the years and I am delighted to see it get the kind of focus it is getting in this debate, because it raises serious issues about the care of children.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said, for a long time — for 14 years of Fianna Fáil Government — the Government failed to enact the kind of protection in legislation and amendment to the Constitution that was needed to copperfasten children's rights.As Members are aware, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was formally established earlier this month.  The decision of the Taoiseach and the Government to establish a new full Ministry and Department of Children and Youth Affairs marks, I believe, a very important value statement about the position of children in our society.  Some commentators have asked why Ireland needs a Department such as this.  With 1.1 million children and young people aged under 18 in Ireland, the real question is why it has taken so long to establish a Department with the commitment to support, safeguard and cherish our nation's children and their quality-of-life and opportunities.  Our children are our future and remain our country's greatest asset.  I see the Department also as very much an economic Department, because the future of our economy is dependent on the access to opportunities in education and health of our children.  Our economy will be hugely determined by how our young people experience life.I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Charlie McConalogue not only on his election, but also his appointment as party spokesman on children.  I look forward to his constructive engagement and that of my Opposition colleagues as I progress my Department's agenda to enhance the outcomes for all our nation's children and young people.  I also wish to acknowledge the work done by Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party during the period when the various committees were considering the issues of children's rights.  They played a strong role on the committee.As part of my Department's ambitious work programme, I confirm and reaffirm the Government's absolute commitment, as provided for in the programme for Government, to bring before the people a proposed amendment of the Constitution to strengthen the protection of the rights of children, along the lines recommended by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  The current Bill, brought before the House tonight by Fianna Fáil, limits itself to the adoption issues alone.  We have heard some comment already as to whether we can have stand alone amendments such as this.  They raise serious questions.  Deputy Ó Cuív spoke about unintended consequences which can arise when one proposes amendments to the Constitution.  I fear that tonight's proposal falls into that category because it does not attempt to raise the broader and vitally-important matters which were the subject of both the 2007 Bill and the proposed wording prepared by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.Parent-child relationships, with their deeply-woven balance of needs, rights and responsibilities, can be most complex, even within a stable and secure family setting.  This is even more so in the case of families in crisis and children at risk.  How the State, through it laws and interventions, both at service and court level, interfaces with the diverse experiences of families and children requires the utmost sensitivity and an appreciation that change in one area can often cause or require change in others.  Our Constitution strikes a balance between personal rights, the status of the family, the rights and duties of parents and the power of the State as guardian of the common good.My aim is simple.  It is to bring forward a holistic and joined-up response to the long-identified need to strengthen our Constitution, copperfasten children's rights and safeguard our children's well-being, while at same time supporting families.  I do not see the reasoning behind bringing forward such a limited approach on just two of the sub-sections of the joint committee's much more comprehensive proposal.  I am not interested in any piecemeal approach to amending the Constitution on this matter.  I believe the way forward and where we should focus our attention is on the development of a composite amendment on children's rights, which will include provisions with regard to adoption.  The principles of the Deputy's Bill will be incorporated in that work.  It is for that reason I do not wish to reject the Deputy's motion at this stage, but rather to amalgamate the commonly shared principles into the broader amendment on children's rights, as was done by the Oireachtas committee of which the Fianna Fáil Party was a member.  The road to constitutional reform of any type can be protracted and cautious by nature.  This is appropriate given the need to ensure that the Constitution, the cornerstone and basic law of the State, reflects the needs, culture and ethos of the people.Before considering the proposal in detail, I would like to provide the background to the referendum on children's rights.  The suggestion of constitutional change in regard to children was first voiced by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, almost 20 years ago, in her capacity as chairwoman of the Kilkenny incest inquiry.  Subsequently, the Constitution review group, in its 1996 report, recommended that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle and to provide an express guarantee of certain other rights for children, deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In 1998, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, examining Ireland's first report on the implementation of the convention, found that Ireland's welfare practices and policies did not adequately reflect the child rights-based approach enshrined in the convention and recommended in favour of the accelerated enactment of the Constitution review group's recommended reforms.Between 1997 and 2002, family rights and related issues were referred to an all-party committee on the Constitution.  That committee reported in 2006, recommending an amendment to Article 41 to include a new section on the rights of children.  Following that recommendation, the late Minister of State with responsibility for children, Mr. Brian Lenihan, to whose work I pay tribute, undertook a review of the Constitution to examine the status of children.  That review, which included wide consultation, resulted in the publication of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill in February 2007.  It sought to enshrine in the Constitution rights that would accrue to children as a distinct group and not simply as human beings and individuals or members of a family unit.  The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children reviewed the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill and recommended an alternative wording for an amendment to the Constitution.The third and final report of the joint committee, published in 2010, deals with the rights of children under the Constitution and the statute and case law concerning adoption, guardianship, care proceedings, custody and access to children.  The committee's final report came after five extensions to its time schedule, due to the extremely complex matters under consideration.  As the House will know, I, along with Deputy Ó Caoláin, served as a member of the joint committee.  The committee's work was positive and focused on the need, where possible, to deliver and develop political consensus.  For the main part that positive approach that led to the development of political consensus.  I, in common with my ministerial predecessors, place a high value on the consensus outcome that was achieved and will work in the same vein to ensure effective outcomes for Irish children.  I hope the introduction of the Bill does not mark or lead to a fragmentation of that all-important consensus.  In developing its report, the committee faced a challenge to balance the rights of families, children and marital and non-marital parents.The committee's report, which is very detailed, carefully and thoroughly examines the proposals contained in the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  As an alternative to the wording contained in that Bill, the joint committee's report recommends inserting a new Article 42 into the Constitution, restating most of the education provisions but adding several new sections and renaming the section entitled "Education" as "Children".The proposed Article 42.1.2° provides specifically that children have specific human rights and that the State has a duty to vindicate the rights of children.  While the concept of the welfare of children is enshrined in some legislation, its use in the proposed Article 42.1 would ensure that children's welfare would be a primary consideration in a range of areas affecting children.The proposals in Article 42.2 would require the State to recognise and vindicate the rights of all children as individuals, as opposed to as children within the family.  It also proposes that a child's voice be heard in any matter affecting the child, with due regard for the age of the child in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.The proposed Article 42.4 deals with what is for many people the most complex part of the proposals.  The primacy of the family is very important to Irish people and there has been concern that by giving rights to children as individuals, rights are taken away from the family.  It should be emphasised, however, that neither the 2007 Bill nor the committee's proposal is attempting to reduce family rights in any way.  It is widely accepted that the best interests of the child are served by being part of a stable family unit.  I hope that, through new constitutional provisions, we can better protect children through supporting the family.However, in amending the Constitution, I want to ensure the State's child and family services have the power to intervene to support families in crisis at an earlier stage and make the sorts of decisions Deputies referred to in the best interests of the child.  I refer to children in foster care, for example, who could be adopted.  We need to safeguard the well-being of children and ultimately support the family with the aim of keeping children from being taken into State care wherever possible.  Under this proposal, the removal of children from their family home will continue to be a last resort.On the proposals relating to adoption, I acknowledge the work of the joint committee in considering this matter in the widest possible context and in the context of legislation. Unfortunately, as I have stated, the Deputy's Bill, which is published in isolation, represents a limited approach involving two of the subsections of the joint committee's wording and does not achieve the Government's objective of strengthening children's rights in the Constitution.  Furthermore, the proposal is phrased in a discretionary and permissive manner.  It provides that laws may be enacted in accordance with the terms therein.As the Deputy is aware, there is a body of work to be done in preparing proposals to be published in conjunction with the Bill to amend the Constitution in respect of adoption, to clarify the Government's intended approach to the operation of this provision.  The Deputy has not published any such proposal, nor has he given an indication of the parameters within which his proposal would apply.  The Government would like to ensure that draft adoption proposals are published before any referendum so the people will be clear about the circumstances in which this would apply and where the best interests of the child would be served by it.  It is critical that people understand what they are voting for.Article 42.5 of the Constitution sets out the threshold for State intervention in family life on behalf of a child, where in exceptional circumstances the State may supply the position of parents.  Until 1988, only the children of unmarried parents could be legally adopted.  The view was taken that the irrevocable nature of an adoption order was incompatible with the inalienable nature of the family's rights under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.The Adoption Act 2010 prescribes that adoption can only occur where the court is satisfied there has been parental failure in the parents' duty towards the child for physical or moral reasons for the previous 12 months, that the failure is likely to continue without interruption until the child reaches 18 years, and that the failure constitutes an abandonment of all constitutional rights on the part of the parents.  The result is that, to date, the availability of adoption to children of marriage has been severely circumscribed, with the result that many children in care are deprived of a second chance for a stable and secure family life.I appreciate that the proposal in the Bill before us appears to be formulated to allow the adoption of children where there has been a failure for such a period as prescribed by law of parents in their responsibility towards their child and where the best interests of the child so require.  However, the Deputy has not indicated the supporting proposals prescribing the period for which failure of parental responsibility must occur.  Would it be for a period of three, five or seven years?  This uncertainty would be most unwelcome.  As I stated, it is for this reason that the Bill needs to be accompanied by a supporting position paper to clarify these issues for the people.The proposal, as published in the Bill, fails to provide a coherent philosophy of children's rights.  It is unfortunately flawed in that it does not clarify the central question of how the rights of children and parents ought to be reconciled in cases where they come into some degree of conflict.  If the proposed articles were passed, the courts would have to decide these issues on the basis of conflicting constitutional criteria.With regard to the specific issue of adoption and in the absence of legislation, the amendment could have a variety of consequences.  It could require the introduction of an approach premised on the best interests of the child.  It could change very little or it could curtail the circumstances in which the children of unmarried parents may be adopted.  To the extent that the drafting of the proposed articles is relevant, the establishment of parental failure as a constitutional principle in all cases would suggest the latter option is the most likely outcome.  It is questionable whether the courts would, for policy reasons, adopt such a restrictive approach.  However, this is a risk that cannot be discounted.For all of these reasons, I am not willing to consider at this stage proposals that offer a piecemeal approach to amending the Constitution when a much more broad and well-rounded approach is and has been the basis of cross-party consensus.  All of society is governed by the Constitution.  It is the Government's position that the rights of children must be balanced with other important principles already contained in the Constitution and which, we believe, are important in protecting and safeguarding children from harm.  The Government is committed to ensuring that there is no dilution of the equally important concepts of the duties of parents and the core position in Irish society of the family unit, and any amendment developed will respect the constitutional position of the family.  These issues were teased out very carefully in work of the committee.Under the last Government, draft wording was developed but, in my view and that of the parties in the new Government, it did not adequately reflect the good work done by the all-Party Oireachtas committee.  The programme for Government for 2011 states the referendum on children's rights is a priority and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the all-party Oireachtas committee.Since taking office as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, officials from my new Department have commenced discussions with the Attorney General with a view to preparing draft wording that will more closely reflect the outstanding work of the joint committee than that approved by the previous Government in draft form.  Following completion of these careful deliberations, I intend to bring the matter to the Government for approval to draft a Bill and hold a referendum.Recently, the Taoiseach stated that the referendum will not take place on the same day as the presidential election.  There is concern that to do so would unnecessarily and unhelpfully politicise children's rights, and that a separate referendum would be more appropriate for this important and sensitive issue.We will take our time over the coming months, although the time the Government takes will be much less than the years of delay by Deputy McConalogue's party when it was in government.  We will take our time and we will get it right and I hope that early next year, when we bring our comprehensive amendment before the people that we will have the support of all parties in the House.I remind the House that our Constitution is held in high esteem not only by the Irish people but also by others throughout the world.  It has been a model for many countries and the Irish have a strong attachment to it.  I aim to present the people with an amendment that is clear and comprehensive, addressing the full range of matters identified by the joint Oireachtas committee.  This is an enormous task but it is also a great opportunity and I invite all sides of the House to join with me over coming months and to help make a difference through progressing a constitutional amendment that properly reflects our shared commitment to support Irish families and to safeguard and cherish our nation's children.

The current legal framework and the discriminatory constitutional definition of "the family" has led to a situation whereby children of marital relationships cannot be adopted even where clearly it would be in their best interests to be so.  Under current legislation, children can live in foster care for all of their childhood and never be allowed to be adopted into a family.  They can be removed on the whim of a social worker or shifted elsewhere when another more needy child is chosen to be placed in that particular foster family's care.This situation has arisen out of an archaic set of laws regarding children and the family which are quite obviously unfit for modern Ireland.  Approximately 2,000 children in foster care, who have grown up with little or no regular contact with their birth parents, are ineligible for adoption.  These children are being denied the opportunity to receive full legal recognition of their real families as distinct from their married birth parents.  Foster parents are the only family they have ever known; they are the people who have reared and sustained them and shown them the real love and support they have needed.  They are denied the stability and sense of permanency offered by adoption.Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines the right of all children to enjoy all the rights in the convention without discrimination of any kind.  The current restriction on the adoption of Irish children of marriage discriminates against them on the basis of the marital status of their parents.  At present, the courts require a very high threshold proving that marital parents are failing in their duty and will continue to fail in this duty.  The same standard is not required of unmarried families as the Constitution, the courts and State do not view them as a recognised family.  Marital parents may have reason to voluntarily place their children for adoption but cannot do so.  This too must be rectified.As I stated, we welcome the Bill but with some considered reluctance.  It would be remiss of me not to place on record our firm opposition to the manner in which Fianna Fáil has chosen to approach this.  It has chosen to isolate one aspect of what was contained in the recommendations of the final report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The wording of its proposed article 42(A) is lifted directly from the text of the agreed wording produced in that committee's report in our proposed articles 42.5 and 42.6 with a one line omission.  Interestingly, that line states "and any such law shall respect the child's right to continuity in its care and upbringing".  This same omission is made in the document provided to me by the then Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, at 6.45 p.m. on 13 January 2011.The proposers of the Bill have focused on adoption and neglected to include anything else that would make a meaningful difference in the lives of children in Ireland.  I am at a loss as to why Fianna Fáil would — and I give some thought to stating this — play politics with an important issue such as this.  Any of us could have taken this course but we have chosen not to.  Fianna Fáil committed to holding a referendum on children's rights and its party members on the Oireachtas committee endorsed the final report.  We had cross-party consensus on the issue and I stress that in my view this was and remains an essential if we are to have a successful referendum campaign.  Given this belief, I must ask whether Fianna Fáil has fully thought through the potential consequences of sequestering the adoption elements of the report.  Everybody agreed there needs to be a constitutional provision to allow children of marital families to be adopted but we also agreed there needs to be a referendum with a broader remit that would strengthen children's rights under the Constitution and we remain committed to this.The proposed wording contained a provision to ensure the right of the child to have his or her best interests considered paramount in all cases concerning guardianship, adoption and care.  It would expressly enshrine a child's right to protection in care, to an education and, very importantly, to be heard.  It balanced this with the rights of parents to be the natural carers, educators and protectors of the child while acknowledging there are sometimes unfortunate and tragic cases where parents cannot or should not be the primary carers of their children.  I ask somebody on the Fianna Fáil benches to let us know whether it has abandoned the idea of a comprehensive children's rights amendment.In 2007, the then Fianna Fáil Government tabled a referendum Bill on children's rights with which nobody was happy.  After the most recent cross-party Oireachtas committee produced its agreed wording, in January this year — and I referenced the text of the Minister of State — the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government produced yet another formula of words that significantly weakened what the committee had agreed and was seeking to achieve.  That wording went out of its way to ensure that children were not guaranteed rights; the rights were merely acknowledged.  However, it did ensure the children of marital families may be adopted but this was about the sum total of it.  I must ask whether it was the intent of Fianna Fáil all along that this would be the only subject dealt with.  This is still my concern.I wish to refresh the memories of the Members of the Government parties that the Labour Party and Fine Gael representatives endorsed the wording set out in that same Oireachtas committee report.  Now they are happily ensconced in government and have had time to settle down, I hope they have revealed their true feelings on the subject.  As an opposition voice, I am pleased to state I am a staunch supporter of the new Department and the Minister's appointment.  No one in the House wishes the Minister a fairer wind than this Deputy.The manifestos of the Labour Party and Fine Gael contained commitments to hold a referendum on children's rights, as did the programme for Government, which referred to a referendum along the lines of the wording of the report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who played a significant role in the committee's work, asked the following question in the House on 12 May last year: "Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the delay in even acknowledging that a referendum on children's rights will take place this year absolutely confirms that the Government is doing nothing other than paying lip service and is prepared to sacrifice the welfare of children to cheap headlines and sound-bites in the daily newspapers?"  I put the same question to the Taoiseach.  Does he acknowledge that his Government is doing nothing other than paying lip service to children's rights?  Prevarication, the absence of product and the failure to give an indication of real progress being made begs the question as to what has happened to the Fine Gael Party's position since it entered government?  It was an ardent proponent of a referendum on children's rights and strongly of the view that there should not be any delay in holding it.In May 2010, the Labour Party supported a Dáil motion tabled jointly with Sinn Féin calling for a children's rights referendum.  What has changed the minds of Labour Party Deputies?  Where is the urgency on this issue expressed in the party's manifesto.  The Government parties have an obligation to live up to the promises they made to the electorate by holding a referendum at the earliest opportunity.While Sinn Féin does not agree with the Fianna Fáil Party's decision to separate this issue, there is no doubt that, if passed, the amendment proposed in the Bill would be a measure of progress.  This must be acknowledged.  There are children who spend large parts of their lives with the same foster parents but cannot be adopted.  While there is a provision in the 1988 Adoption Act which provides for the adoption of a marital child, the constitutional right of the marital family remains in place.  In one case of which I am aware, which is referenced in the final report of the joint committee — Western Health Board H.B. and N.B. v.  An Bord Uchtála of 1995 — a child was born to a married woman who had separated from her husband.  She believed the child to be that of a man with whom she had been in a relationship.  It transpired, however, that the child was of her former husband who had raped her.  The child was placed with foster parents who wished to adopt it.  After some time, the husband sought custody.  A court held that the mere actions of the husband seeking custody were sufficient to establish he had not abandoned his parental rights and, accordingly, the child could not be adopted.  The best interests of the child were nowhere to be seen in the consideration of this case.It is up to Fine Gael and the Labour Party to live up to  their obligations and commitments to hold a referendum on children's rights with appropriate urgency.  The Government must also show appropriate urgency regarding the all-party agreed recommendations contained in the first report of the most recent joint committee published in September 2008, which addressed the need for legislation on soft information.  We are weeks from the summer recess and on the return of the House, a full three years will have passed without legislation being published, not to speak of being passed.For the purposes of the proposition before the House, Sinn Féin will support the Private Members' Bill with all the reservations I have placed on record.  However, the legislation must not be viewed as a substitute for a comprehensive constitutional amendment which will give children the rights they deserve.  I place my trust in that regard in the Minister and her new Department.  From time to time I will urge her and egg her on as best I can.  I call on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to fulfil its promises and to hold a referendum based on the wording set out in the final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, on this Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.  Sinn Féin supports the Bill, which addresses an important issue, albeit with some reservations.Thousands of children have been left in residential care over the years or shuttled from foster parent to foster parent with infrequent visits from social workers.  However, they are sometimes left in the care of foster parents who will be the only family they ever know.  If they are children of marital families, the foster parent will be unable to adopt them as natural parents continue to retain all their rights over the child and have access to them.  If the child has been placed in voluntary care, parents can reclaim the child at any time, a position endorsed by the Supreme Court in what is known as the Baby Ann case.As it is not legally necessary for a foster parent to be married, fostering involves greater flexibility than adoption.  Many people, including older people, gay couples and single women and men, find fostering an easier route to pursue than the restrictive and difficult nature of adoption rules.  This should not be the case and the issue is not addressed in the Bill.  The adoption system needs substantial overhaul and reform.Fostering is less secure than adoption because foster parents have a number of duties and few rights.  Should a foster parent attempt to adopt a child in his or her care without securing the approval of the Health Service Executive, he or she risks being held liable for the costs of a case being brought against him or her.  This imposes a major financial risk on people.  While Sinn Féin supports the Bill on a referendum on children's rights, unless a referendum is followed by legislation to rectify the anomalies I have outlined, it will be of little use.Foster parents are caught in a bind.  Children in foster families do not have the same stability found in adoptive families.  Save through court proceedings, they are not independently represented and orders can and have been made which have resulted in children being taken from parents with whom they have lived for years and given to virtual strangers without cognisance of their welfare.  Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights require separate representation for children in such a scenario.  The State has failed to implement this requirement as it is much more concerned with what it would cost to pay a guardian ad litem than listening to what a child wants.The proposed constitutional amendment contained in the final report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children provided for children's voices to be heard in judicial and administrative matters which concern themselves.  It is disappointing that the Fianna Fáil Party has chosen to disregard everything else the joint committee stated and focus on adoption alone.While it is a welcome gesture on the part of the Government to introduce a full Department for Children and Youth Affairs, it is disgraceful that this Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition is to further delay the long promised and long overdue constitutional referendum on the rights of children.  Both parties played a key role in the joint committee which agreed a wording to strengthen the rights and protections of children in the Constitution.  My colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, paid tribute to everyone involved in the proceedings of the joint committee.  Unfortunately, its report remains on a shelf.  Notwithstanding the commitments given by both Government parties in their manifestos to hold a referendum on children's rights, the Taoiseach has stated the three referendums to be held in the autumn will not include a referendum on affording protection to children.  The coalition failed on children's rights before it even reached 100 days in office.  This regressive decision must be overturned.This Bill should not be used as a substitute for holding a referendum that will enshrine children's rights.  While it is a welcome move, it was unfortunate that details of the Roscommon abuse case has to emerge for people to wake up to the reality that legal difficulties arise when dealing with marital families.  The proposed amendment would not do much to help children in such scenarios.  If a referendum were held and passed tomorrow, it would make little difference to the children who reside within the confines of dysfunctional child services.  It would not alter the fact that the recommendations of Tracey Fay and Ryan reports and the Monageer Inquiry have not been implemented.  It will not magically provide 24 hour, on-call social workers, resource underfunded services with overworked staff or provide an avenue for children to be heard and their best interests made paramount in all matters concerning them.While I support this Bill, it is a lost opportunity and I call upon the Government parties to put their commitment on the record that they will hold a children's rights referendum immediately and implement the outstanding recommendations of the relevant reports.  They owe it to the children of Ireland to do so.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I thank and compliment Fianna Fáil for putting it before the House.  Fianna Fáil is calling on the Government to arrange for a referendum on adoption to be held at the same time as the presidential election.  Most Opposition Deputies want that to happen.  This Bill would give rights to children currently in foster care and ineligible for adoption because of constitutional restrictions arising from the special position of the family in Irish law.  I support it.  The proposed changes in the Constitution would provide more robust rights for children.  They are long overdue.This is not a new issue, as previous speakers have mentioned.  The late Deputy Brian Lenihan drew attention to this issue at a consultation conference on adoption and fostering which he organised in 2003.  The referendum on the proposals contained in this Bill should not and cannot be delayed.  I am disappointed the Government parties, who worked on this issue in committees when they were in the Opposition, are not bringing forward a referendum to be held at the same time as the presidential election.  I am aware it is proposed to hold a number of other referenda, but surely this issue is of immense importance.  The well-being and care of our children must be a priority for us all.  A number of related issues were raised at the consultation conference held by the late Deputy Brian Lenihan which are not addressed in this Bill.  The motion has not received attention so far.There are still no adopted people sitting on the Adoption Authority of Ireland alongside adoptive parents.  That is a big failure.  They must be included there as of right.  Who better to be part of that authority than people who were adopted and have experienced the situation?  Adopted people still do not have the right to get their birth certificates.  That is a huge difficulty which causes great trauma and strife for families.In recent years, adoptions in Ireland have become increasingly rare and many prospective parents go abroad to adopt a child.  We are aware of the saga with foreign adoptions and how the previous Minister, the former Deputy Barry Andrews, tried hard to resolve the situation.  We met many deputations and families.  Every Deputy in the House has met couples who are desperate to adopt from foreign countries and who are extremely frustrated by the slow pace of such adoptions.  I accept there must be due process and the legal issues must be resolved, but it is very frustrating for these couples.  They are getting older and have put much effort into the process.  In many cases, they have travelled abroad.  They have examined all the issues and prepared for it in this country.  They have adapted their homes and looked forward to the adoption, so it is very disappointing to be let down again.There are serious issues in Ireland relating to children in foster care.  The majority of foster parents do an excellent job and are a valuable resource.  That said, there are deep concerns about the vetting of foster families and the supports being provided for those families and children in care.  I compliment the newly appointed Minister and wish her well in her brief.  Cases that are very scary are brought to my attention occasionally.  They involve the vetting of people and the type of people — they are a minority — who are allowed to be foster parents.  They continue to act as foster parents despite concerns being raised by the community with public representatives and the public authorities.  Nothing seems to happen.There must be a review and reform of the child welfare and protection system.  There are currently 6,000 children and young people in care, either with relatives, in residential care or in care in high support residential placements.  I am not enamoured of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, but, in fairness, on this issue it has developed standards for and carried out reviews of the foster care system.  One report was produced in July 2010 and there was a report on a special care unit in December 2010.  Both reports provide important recommendations for the future.Last year, 90% of young people in care had been allocated a social worker and 80% had dedicated care plans.  While this represents ongoing improvement, we must bring these figures up to 100%.  The State has a duty of care to these children.  I believe this constitutional amendment, which would permit adoption in such cases, would be beneficial for the children involved.  However, it is part of a larger children's rights agenda that must include a referendum on children's rights.  It is a pity this opportunity will pass without it being put to the people.  It is a vital area.  I accept that the Minister and her party are committed to this but I worry about the delays.  Each hour, day or week of delay is too long.  I hope it will not be a year.  It is a traumatic area and there must be action on it in line with the commitments given by the Government parties when they were the Opposition.  I look forward to supporting the Bill.Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló.

Is iomaí duine a chuaigh ar scoil ansin atá ina Ghaeilgeoir breá sa lá atá inniu ann mar gheall ar an oideachas iontach a fhaigheann na daltaí ar scoil ansin.Is ceantar mór fairsing é ceantar Mhaigh Cuilinn, an ceantar chomh fada siar ansin go Ros Cathail, agus freastalaíonn an scoil ar cheantar fairsing.  Tá 88 scolairí sa scoil, le ceithre oide agus ceithre rang.  Tugaim cuireadh don Aire Stáit cuairt a thabhairt ar an scoil mar feicfidh sé ceann de na seanscoileanna.  Tá sé go deas seanscoil a fheiceáil ach níl sé go deas bheith ag freastal nó ag múineadh i seanscoil.  Tá seomraí ranga an-bheag inti, ceann acu 49 meadar cearnógach agus ceann eile 52 meadar cearnógach.  An gnáthrud a mholann an Roinn anois ná 80 meadar cearnógach do rang.  Níl oifig ag an phríomhoide nó ag an fhoireann agus níl seomra ann don chúntóir teanga a thagann isteach ag treisiú Ghaeilge na ngasúr óga a théann chuig an scoil seo.  Is trua nach bhfuil cóiríocht iomlán á cur ar an scoil.Cheadaigh an Rialtas deireanach roinnt airgid don scoil chun seomra ranga a chur leis an scoil ach tá dhá sheomra réamhdhéanta ann.  Cé nach bhfuil an tAire anseo anocht, táim cinnte gur cuimhin leis an gheallúint a thug sé i nGaillimh agus é ag comhdháil Phairtí an Lucht Oibre go bhfaigheadh sé réidh leis na seomraí réamhdhéanta uilig agus nach bhfágfaí ann iad.  Tá péire i gceist sa scoil seo: seomra ranga buan agus seomra tacaíochta foghlama.  Ní bhfaighidh siad réidh leis an dá sheomra réamhdhéanta leis an airgead atá curtha ar fáil faoi láthair.  Mar sin, d'iarrfainn air cur leis an deontas atá ceadaithe don scoil.Ar €254,000 breise, bheifí in ann céim 1, 2 agus 3 den obair bhreise atá le déanamh a dhéanamh.  Ar €790,000 d'fhéadfaí an rud a chríochnú amach uilig agus seomra ilúsáid, nó GP room mar a tugtar air i mBéarla, a chur ar fáil.  Chuirfeadh sé sin barr slacht ar an scoil seo agus ní thiocfaí in aice leis an Aire go ceann i bhfad ina dhiaidh sin mar bheadh cóiríocht cheart ar an scoil.Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, nuair a bhí bunáite na scoileanna á dhéanamh cuireadh deontais bhreise ar fáil faoin Rialtas deiridh agus tugadh deis do scoileanna an cóiríocht a thabhairt suas don chaighdeán cheart le nach mbeadh aon ghá le tuilleadh airgid chaipitil a chaitheamh ar bhunáite na scoileanna beaga ar fud na tíre go ceann i bhfad.D'impóinn ar an Aire Stáit dea-scéal a thabhairt dom, ar a laghad go dtiocfadh sé siar agus go mbreathnódh sé ar an scoil.  B'fhearr i bhfad liom go sábhalfadh sé an t-aistear air féin agus go gceadódh sé an t-airgead.  Déanfaidh mé cinnte go bhfaighidh sé cuireadh len í a oscailt má dhéanann sé é sin.  Ba bhreá liom é a fheiceáil thiar.  Bhí an-lá againn nuair a bhí muid thiar i Leitir Mealláin.  Beidh ceiliúradh mór againn arís nuair a osclóidh sé athchóiriú iomlán na scoile seo agus nuair a bheidh sé in ann é seo a leanas a rá.  "Bhí mise ceart.  Rinne mé an beart.  Thug mé an t-airgead. Tá Scoil an Bhaile Nua ar cheann des na scoileanna is stairiúla i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus tá cóiriú curtha agamsa air."  Níl mórán scoileanna beaga mar seo fágtha againn don Aire Stáit.  Seo an seans deiridh atá aige.Beidh mé ag siúl le dea-scéala, ar a laghad go dtiocfaidh an t-Aire Stáit siar.  Ach b'fhearr i bhfad an t-airgead a cheadú agus teacht agus í a oscailt.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó Cuív faoin ábhar seo a tharraingt anuas mar go dtugann sé deis dom straitéis an Rialtais maidir le hinfheistíocht chaipitil i dtionscadail oideachais a leagan amach, chomh maith le soiléireacht a thabhairt ar chúrsaí mar atá faoi láthair maidir le Scoil Bhaile Nua, Maigh Cuilinn.Mar is eol don Teachta Ó Cuív rinne údaras na scoile iarratas ar mhórmhaoiniú caipitil le síneadh a chur leis an scoil agus athrú a dhéanamh uirthi chomh maith le hobair athchóirithe.  Mar chuid den phroiséas measúnaithe sanntar rátáil banda do thionscadail tógála ar scála mór de réir na gcritéir tosaíochta atá foilsithe.  Ba i ndiaidh comhchomhairle le pairtnéiri oideachais a leagadh amach na critéir seo. Is de réir na rátála banda a thugtar dó a ghluaiseann tionscadal tógála tríd an gcóras.  Tá ceithre rátáil banda ann, banda 1 an ceann is airde agus banda a 4 an ceann is ísle.  Rátáil banda 2.5 atá tugtha do thionscadal Scoil Bhaile Nua.  Bíonn dul chun cinn gach tionscadal tógála ar scála mór, lena n-áiritear an tionscadal seo ón gcéim deartha tosaigh go dtí an chéim tógála, ag brath ar an mhaoiniú a bhíonn ar fáil faoi chlár ilbhliantúil tógála agus nuachóirithe scoileanna na Roinne agus ar an éileamh atá ar an mhaoiniú seo.Nuair a bhí an t-iarratas dá dtagraítear dó thuas faighte, rinne an scoil iarratas i Márta 2010 ar sheomra eile breise príomhshrutha. Cheadaigh an Roinn an deontas don seomra ranga sin agus tá 70% den deontas tarraingthe ag an scoil go dtí seo.  Tá ceathrar múinteoirí i Scoil Bhaile Nua.  Anois go bhfuil an seomra ranga breise sin ceadaithe beidh ceithre sheomra ranga príomhshrutha sa scoil agus seomra eile a mbainfear leas as mar sheomra acmhainne/ilchuspóire.I Meán Fómhair 2010 rinne údarás na scoile iarratas ar mhaoiniú suntasach breise chun seomra a chur in áit sheomra ranga sealadach, le seomraí ranga atá ann cheana a mhéadú agus le cóiríocht choimhdeach a sholáthar, lena n-áirítear seomra ilfhointeach.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	401	At the outset, I will give a brief history of Dromclough national school.  On the recommendation of a Department inspector, Dr. Pádraig Ó Donnabháin, an application for an extension to the school building was submitted to the Department building unit in 2002.  In January 2003, a detailed comprehensive application was submitted to the Department for a major refurbishment and extension to the school.  In June 2004, as no progress had manifested, a small Portakabin was purchased and divided into three cubicles to provide accommodation of three resource and learning support areas.  This Portakabin was purchased following the fundraising activities of the community.  No grant assistance was furnished by the Department.  The school authorities were informed by the Department that no funding was available for this project.In January 2006, following an interim period of two years, the board of management and the local communities were elated to receive correspondence from the building unit of the Department stating that approval had been sanctioned for an eight classroom school.  The board of management was advised in correspondence to expect a site visit from the Department's technical design team at a date prior to Easter 2006.  If that was not possible, the board of management were assured that a site visit would take place before the commencement of the summer of 2006.  However, the proposed site visit has not taken place.While waiting for the proposed site visit, the board of management contacted the Department to seek grant assistance to extend the school car park.  This request was made due to concerns regarding increased traffic flow on a narrow road at the entrance to the school and after consultation with parents and gardaí.  The board of management were advised not to continue with this application as it would jeopardise the previous application for the major refurbishment and extension.In June 2008, the board of management gratefully accepted an offer of one prefabricated building, which was no longer required by a school in the area.  That school was due to be demolished because it was in such a bad condition.  The board of management applied to DEIS for grant assistance of €25,000 to assist the relocation of the prefab to Dromclough national school and was grateful on receiving it.The existing accommodation consists of three small rooms of 45 m2 that were constructed in 1964.  There are three classrooms of good standard that were constructed in 1981.  There is one prefabricated building that was secured in 1991 and a Portakabin, locally funded, that was added in 2004.  One salvaged second-hand prefabricated building was secured in 2008.The conditions in the school and the prefabs are deplorable.  The electric wiring is dangerous and is an accident waiting to happen.  The school has totally inadequate access for disabled pupils and parents.  Currently, there is one pupil in the infant class whose father is wheelchair-bound.  The refusal of the Department to allow the school carry out a survey is unfathomable.  When the wheelchair-bound parent visits the school a temporary ramp must be fitted in place.  There is no wheelchair accessible toilet or disabled parking.  Security at the school is of major concern.  There are 11 entrances to the school.Dromclough national school is a very progressive school.  The parents have a strong record of support for the school throughout the years.  This is evidenced by the fact that a Portakabin was added to the school in 2004 for use by special needs students.  The small Portakabin was divided into three sections to facilitate resource teachers and their pupils.  The Portakabin was totally funded by the community.There are 16 staff in the school.  The principal carries out her managerial and administrative duties in a space that was formerly a toilet.  There are no ancillary rooms, library, proper medical facilities, reception area and no storage.  It will be an indictment on the previous Government and on this Government if funding is not made available immediately to proceed with the design to build a school in that area, which is long overdue.  It is probably one of the worst schools in County Kerry.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputy for raising this, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in school building projects and also to outline the current application by the school authority to provide for an extension to Dromclough national school in Listowel, County Kerry.As the Deputy will be aware all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of school buildings, site capacity and so forth, leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of the assessment process a school project is assigned a band rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.Under the prioritisation criteria, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of school accommodation where there is no existing school or where existing provision is unable to meet the demand for pupil places.  A band 4 project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.The project to provide for an extension and refurbishment for Dromclough national school has been assigned a band 2.2 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  The school has a current staffing level of a principal and seven mainstream teachers.  It also has the services of three learning support-resource teachers.  Its accommodation comprises six mainstream permanent classrooms, two temporary mainstream classrooms and three ancillary accommodation.  The school's enrolment was 193 pupils at September 2010.  With regard to enrolment, there has been no change in its pupil numbers over the last five years and, therefore, the school is not experiencing the rapid increase in enrolments that have occurred in other schools around the county.The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2011 and subsequent years.  However, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project at this time.  I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the school building project for Dromclough national school, Listowel, County Kerry.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State.  The reason I raise this issue is that in most rural constituencies, such as that of the Acting Chairman, one-off housing is a major part of their economic fibre.  In rural areas such as Limerick county, one-off rural housing is the only construction activity taking place.  Housing estates are not being built in small towns and villages and, in some instances, ghost estates lie derelict.  The one thing keeping people employed in construction in rural communities is one-off housing.The previous Government realised some people would find it increasingly difficult to exercise their planning permission, particularly for such housing.  An amendment was made to the Planning and Development Acts, which was followed up by statutory instrument, to allow local authorities to grant five-year extensions to planning permissions for people who could not exercise them.  The problem is that a number of local authorities have been tempted to impose additional conditions that were not applied when the original permission sought and I have confirmed this with a number of colleagues.That is unfair, primarily because the people affected cannot afford to build.  In some instances, they paid massive sums for sites and they went through various hoops and regulations to secure planning permission but now when they seek to extend it, they are running into problems.  It should be borne in mind that the Department, the local authority, An Bord Pleanála and everybody else with an interest in planning and development acknowledged when planning permission was granted in principle that a house could be built on the site.  Now that these people have run into economic difficulties, they are being told that they can build on the site but X, Y and Z condition is being imposed on them.  That is unfair, particularly in many cases they are hard pressed economically.  In some instances, they are in negative equity.Recently, I encountered a case where the applicants had passed the percolation test for the building of a one-off rural house.  The issue has made the news in recent days with the proposal to impose a charge on septic tanks.  However, these people went through the hoops and secured planning permission.  A rigorous site assessment was carried out but now it appears the same local authority wants to tweak the permission slightly, which will result in a new application having to be submitted and this, in turn, will open up everything again.  People in other counties who have no connection to the site will have carte blanche to object.  That is grossly unfair.I can anticipate the Minister of State's reply because I have been issued with similar responses to parliamentary questions but there is scope in this regard.  The spirit of the amendment to the legislation was intended to help those who are hard pressed economically and who cannot at the moment exercise their permission.  There are ghost estates around the country but we are in danger of creating ghost houses where houses will be built to ridge height but the owners will not install windows or kit the property out because they cannot afford to do so.  This will be a huge issue in rural communities over the next five years.I intend raising this issue at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht but I ask the Minister to revisit the spirit of the legislation.  The people affected are not big developers in the National Asset Management Agency but young couples primarily who are trying to get on with their lives and who may have been made redundant or who have encountered tough economic times.  Local authorities are being mean-spirited in this regard.Will the Minister of State relay my concerns to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to carrying out an audit of local authorities regarding this issue?  They are using this amendment as another opportunity on which to hang the hat of anti-rural housing.  The Minister's predecessor, a member of the Green Party, had an anti-one-off rural house agenda and I would hate to think the Government will carry on this.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss the provisions of the planning code as they relate to the scope to seek to extend planning permissions.Section 28 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 amended section 42 of the Planning Act 2000 to provide that the duration of a planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been done, or where the development has not even commenced, in cases where the planning authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.  This is pursuant to the terms of the planning permission, provided that an application complying with the relevant regulations was made before the expiration of the original permission.This provision is, however, subject to the following qualifications.  The planning authority must be satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the relevant regional planning guidelines since the date of the permission, such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.  The planning authority must be satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, such as those dealing with flood risk management, even if those guidelines were issued after the date of the grant of permission.  Finally, the planning authority must be satisfied, where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or a habitats directive appropriately assessed, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.In extending the duration of permission under the new provision, it is open to a planning authority to attach conditions requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development.  Planning authorities may also add to or vary any conditions regarding security to which the permission is already subject under section 34(4)(g) of the Planning Acts. This type of condition — a condition requiring a bond, or a further bond — is the only condition that may be attached to an extension of permission.  A planning authority may not, when granting an extension, vary the initial permission in any other way.The previous provisions in section 42 of the Planning Act 2000 remain in force, allowing an extension of permission to be automatically granted on application, in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration, subject only to the condition that an application, complying with the relevant planning regulations, was made before the expiration of the initial period.I consider that the new provision strikes an appropriate balance.  It is proper and prudent practice that in cases where substantial works have not been carried out, the duration of permission should be re-assessed against the current planning policies and legislation in force at the time.  The duration of permission should not be extended in respect of developments for which the planning authority would now refuse permission if an application were submitted de novo.

Under this programme there has been considerable capital investment in Custume Barracks.  The most recent major projects include the construction of a new Gymnasium, refurbishment of the Watergate Building as Office Accommodation, a gas and water main upgrade and the provision of new underground services and associated works.  Currently the construction of New Armoured Vehicle Garaging is underway in addition to the repair and upgrading of the heating system in the Dining Hall.  There are also plans to upgrade the electrical transformer later in the year.  Approximately €4.5 million of the capital budget has been invested in Custume Barracks over the past three to four years.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	406	The Programme for Government provides for the initiation of a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances.  Proposals for reform of the governance of the Irish Red Cross Society initially arose from a resolution that was passed in November 2007 by the Council of Delegates of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) which urged all National Societies to examine and update their Statutes — the rules of the National Societies — and related legal texts by 2010.  I am aware that a Working Group to propose changes in the governance of the Society was established by the Irish Red Cross in 2008.  The Chairman of the Working Group presented the findings, which included changes recommended by the International Federation, to the Central Council of the Irish Red Cross Society at a meeting held in November 2009.  The Working Group's report was then submitted to the Department of Defence early last year.Following the Department's review of these proposals and the related legislation, a draft Order that would amend the Irish Red Cross Order 1939 was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General.  The 1939 Order sets out the basis upon which the Society is governed and was made pursuant to the Red Cross Act 1938.Discussions with the Office of the Attorney General on the extent of changes that can be made to the 1939 Order are continuing.  Following receipt of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, I will review the legislative changes that are proposed and consider bringing them to Government for approval.  Whatever changes are made to the 1939 Order, a comprehensive review of all Red Cross legislation, and in particular the primary legislation, will then be commenced by my Department.In this regard, whilst I am conscious of the importance attaching to the independence of the Society, I have been in contact with the Chairman of the Irish Red Cross recently in relation to the Society's corporate governance arrangements.  While I note that some progress has been made by the Society in this regard, it is in my opinion crucial that the Society makes further substantial progress to ensure that its corporate governance structures comply with the highest standards.  For instance, it is not conducive to good corporate governance that any individual should serve indefinitely on the Central Council or the Executive Committee, or in the same appointment.  I would urge the Society, which is the beneficiary of State funding — both directly and indirectly — to make further substantial progress in this area so as to ensure that its corporate governance standards meets what would be regarded as acceptable for an organisation of the calibre of the Red Cross.  With this in mind, I have arranged to meet with the Chairman of the Society shortly.  Officials from my Department have met regularly with the Irish Red Cross in recent months and will continue to do so.  Officials have also met with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and in this regard I believe that an overriding principle must be to ensure that any legislative changes made have the full support of the International Federation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force was suspended in late 2008 pending a review of the best means by which to achieve the reduction of 3% in payroll costs that had been applied, in common with other areas of the public service, to the Defence Forces.  The present position is that, within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Defence Forces.  To this end, targeted recruitment was carried out in 2010 and 2011.  The Military Authorities have advised that to the end of May 2011 a total of 265 General Service Recruits have been enlisted.  There are no plans for further general service recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force at this time.There will be an intake of 30 cadets from the Cadetship Competition in 2011 and a number of technical appointments will also be filled.With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.

Ireland's policy on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons which is primarily a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs  advocates the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the prevention of nuclear weapons capability, a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions, greater controls on the trade in small arms and light weapons and the implementation and strengthening of treaties banning the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of chemical and biological weapons.  The equipment, including ordnance and weapons, held by the Defence Forces is acquired to maintain the capability of the Defence Forces to deliver effective services across all the roles assigned by Government, at home and overseas.  The weaponry used by the Defence Forces for training and operational purposes complies with all international conventions.  The primary purpose for such equipment is the protection of personnel, particularly on overseas missions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region.  In accordance with the roles assigned to them in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps and the Naval Service are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to search and rescue.  In this regard, the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capabilities.  A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide, within their capabilities, to the Coast Guard.  The provision of assistance during mountain rescue operations and fixed wing top cover by the Air Corps Casa aircraft to Coast Guard helicopters is included in the agreement.  Assistance that is provided by the Naval Service to the Coast Guard during maritime search and rescue and recovery operations is also covered in the SLA.In relation to coastal surveillance activity, the Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships.  All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery, and drug interdiction operations.The current Exclusive Fishery Limits, or the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone, extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.  All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.  A contract was placed last year for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service, each of which will be almost 90 metres in length.  The acquisition of these larger vessels will ensure that the Service can continue to carry out all its taskings in increasingly difficult and dangerous sea conditions in the Atlantic.  Preparations for their construction have commenced at Appledore in the UK and the first vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.  The second new vessel will follow one year later.The Naval Service intends to further enhance its surveillance capabilities by utilizing both the Coast Guard's Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) system which identifies merchant shipping in and approaching Irish waters.The two Air Corps Casa aircraft also have an important surveillance capability which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Exclusive Economic Zone.  These aircraft both underwent mid-life upgrades which were completed in 2008 at a cost of €16.5m.  The upgrades included the fitting of state of the art surveillance and communication equipment.I am satisfied that both the Air Corps and Navy have the necessary resources to meet all their operational requirements including the provision of search and rescue assistance to the Coast Guard and surveillance taskings.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide assistance in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework.  Representation on the Government Task Force, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation with the appropriate lead Department in the event of an emergency.  The Defence Forces are also members of eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework in order to coordinate the work of the Principal Response Agencies.  Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities and I am satisfied that this arrangement works well locally.The various procedures that are in place, both nationally and locally, were seen to operate very effectively recently as the Defence Forces responded to all requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the recent period of severe weather which ran from 27 November to 26 December 2010.During this period, all assets, resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces nationally were made available to the Task Force, and its Inter Agency Coordination Committee, for the purpose of providing assistance where it was not possible for other agencies and organisations to respond.The Inter Agency Coordination Committee, which met almost daily throughout the emergency, requested that, strategically, the Defence Forces would concentrate its support effort on the Health Service Executive, mainly in relation to mobility tasks. Approximately 70% of all ATCA operations conducted by the Defence Forces were in support of the HSE.  This proved to be a very effective approach as transport was provided to HSE staff such as palliative care and community nurses visiting patients and in the transport of health workers, particularly doctors and nurses, to their place of work and, indeed, between hospitals as the need arose.Assistance was also provided to those involved in the delivery of meals on wheels whilst focused ice and snow clearing operations were also carried out throughout the country; with particular efforts being made to maintain the safety of public infrastructure and key transport hubs.Overall, I believe that the response of the Defence Forces proved to be extremely effective.

In accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008, this Department must be satisfied that an applicant is an Irish citizen before issuing him with a passport.As the applicant was born in the State in February, 2011 her entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the 1956 Act).  The 1956 Act provides that a person, who is born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005 and does not have a parent who is either an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding the birth of the child.This Department assesses such applications in line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for matters of citizenship and immigration.  In accordance with these guidelines, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered in connection with passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  These are official documents, which can be objectively verified and are relied on by the Department in the processing of passport applications.In line with the requirements of the 1956 Act, the lawful residence in the State of the applicant's father in the four year period preceding his daughter's date of birth was examined.  Based on the evidence of immigration stamps in his passport, the total amount of reckonable residence did not meet with the statutory requirement of three years.  It should be noted that, in accordance with the guidelines of the Department of Justice and Equality, residence in Ireland in relation to permissions to stay in the State for studying is not reckonable for the purposes of the 1956 Act.  Any period of the father's residence, which has been authorised by immigration authorities for study, was therefore, excluded from the Department's calculation.  As the child's entitlement to Irish citizenship had not been demonstrated in accordance with the guidelines of the Department of Justice and Equality, this Department could not issue a passport to her.The Department wrote to the applicant's parents on 30 April, 2011 and again on 16 June 2011 to explain this decision.  Moreover, the parents were asked to submit immigration details in respect of the mother to see if she had the required amount of reckonable residence.  Unfortunately, no reply has been received from them.In light of the above, I regret to inform you that, as the applicant's entitlement to Irish citizenship has still not been demonstrated in accordance with the Department of Justice and Equality's guidelines, this Department remains unable to issue a passport to the person in question at this time.

Evidence of that person's entitlement to Irish citizenship must be provided with his/her passport application.  Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, (1956 Act) persons born in the State after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside without restriction in the State or in Northern Ireland, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding their birth.Section 6B(2) of the 1956 Act makes particular provision for nationals of EU Member States who by making a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland for three of the four years immediately preceding the child's birth will be regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland in respect of the declared periods for purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proved.  All declarations must be supported by evidence of residence such as tax certificates, bank statements etc.In the case raised by the Deputy , however, we do not have sufficient information to give clear guidelines as to the entitlement to an Irish passport.  If the Deputy wishes to provide these, we would be happy to provide further advice.

Minister of State Creighton, appointed to both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has special responsibility for European Affairs.  She plays an active role in engaging with partners in EU member States and the European institutions.  She deputises for me on matters relating to the EU agenda when necessary, including in the context of Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council meetings.  She also plays a key role in coordinating the Government's handling of EU issues, including through chairing the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on European Affairs and the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on the Presidency.I have responsibility for representing Ireland at the Foreign Affairs Council and the General Affairs Council.  On occasions when I have not been able to do so, Ireland has been represented by Minister of State Creighton.  Since the formation of the Government she has represented Ireland at the General Affairs Council meetings on 21 March, 13 April, 23 May and 21 June; and at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 21 March and 23 May.Minister of State O'Sullivan is Minister of State for Trade and Development at my Department.  This role includes responsibility for the Government's Overseas Development Aid programme, Irish Aid, which is managed by my Department. Ireland's aid programme is internationally recognised as one of the best in the world and has as its overall focus the reduction of poverty with an emphasis on hunger and related areas.  The aid programme also responds to humanitarian emergencies and development assistance is delivered through a range of partnerships including local and national authorities, communities, NGOs and international partners such as the UN system.Minister of State O'Sullivan has also been assigned responsibility for Trade.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department now has an enhanced role in trade promotion and I will be fully supported in this by the Minister of State.  In particular, she will be working with me in the Export Trade Council, which I will chair and which will be established shortly.  The Council will bring together Government Departments, the State Agencies and representatives of the private sector with experience of the export sector.  Both the Minister of State and I will lead trade missions as appropriate.  We will work closely together to develop the key contribution of Ireland's Embassy network to the export-led growth essential to economic recovery.  I can assure the Deputy that Minister O'Sullivan has already been actively engaged in economic and trade work in the course of a number of overseas visits, including to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and most recently to Africa.In relation to Minister of State O'Sullivan's attendance as Ministerial Councils, twice a year, usually in May and November, the Foreign Affairs Council meetings include a session on development, which is attended by Member States' Development Ministers. Minister of State O'Sullivan attended the development segment of the May 2011 Foreign Affairs Council which was held in Brussels on 24 May.  The next development cooperation session of the Foreign Affairs Council is scheduled for 10 November 2011.Both Ministers also undertake other Departmental duties, at my request, as the need arises.

The Ambassador in Tokyo chairs a local market team which brings together the relevant State Agencies focussed on developing further our trading and investment links with Japan.  The Government attaches great importance to developing our trade and economic links with all of our Asian partners.  In this context, I hope to attend the annual meeting of Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum (APIBF) in Seoul, Korea on 14 October 2011.  While it will not be possible to schedule a full trade mission to Japan before the end of 2011, I hope to visit Tokyo en route to the APIBF meeting and to have a number of meetings there focussed on trade and economic issues.

Our Embassies will generally provide a consular presence at the match venue and they take part in discussions surrounding the logistical and security arrangements for same.  Officials from the Embassy in Moscow, who are in close liaison with my Department's Consular Division, met with representatives of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in Moscow to discuss preparations for the Ireland-Russia match scheduled to take place there on 6 September 2011, at the Luzhniki Stadium.  These FAI representatives have, in turn, met with representatives of the Russian football federation, staff at the Luzhniki Stadium and other relevant bodies.Comprehensive travel advice is prepared for all Irish away games and this will be issued nearer to the match.  The advice will be posted on the Department's website and distributed through the FAI and travel agents.  This advice will include lessons drawn from the experiences of fans in 2002 and at other important international matches played in Moscow and other cities over the intervening period.  Further contacts with relevant authorities in the Russian Federation will take place in the coming weeks and officials from our Embassy in Moscow will take care that the authorities are aware of our concern that appropriate arrangements be in place to ensure that the travelling fans are able to enjoy a great sporting occasion, without having concerns for their safety or wellbeing.

My officials have been working on preparations for the OSCE chairmanship since last summer and, to this end, a dedicated OSCE Task Force was established in my Department in October.  This is likely to number approximately 15 officials, with a similar number working at Ireland's Permanent Mission to the OSCE in Vienna.  The OSCE's activities cover a broad spectrum of activities and I want to ensure that all our government Departments are in a position to contribute to, and gain from, our chairmanship.  To this end, an Inter-Departmental meeting took place earlier this year and regular consultations have been held with officials from other government Departments, who will be able to contribute relevant expertise over the course of Ireland's chairmanship.  With regard to the Houses of the Oireachtas, I would expect that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will discuss OSCE developments in the course of its work.The OSCE remains a cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity in Europe and I look forward greatly to the challenge of providing its political leadership next year.

Ireland succeeded at the European Council in having the current unsatisfactory human rights situation in Bahrain addressed in the formal conclusions adopted, with the final agreed Declaration expressing the European Council's concern about the process surrounding the trials and sentencing of opposition members in Bahrain and encouraging Bahrain to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Taoiseach spoke about the situation in Bahrain at the European Council and in support of the efforts led by Ireland to include such a reference in the final Declaration.  I have already made clear on a number of occasions, including in this House, my own deep concern and that of the Irish Government and people at the current human rights situation in Bahrain.  This includes condemning the severity of the life sentences imposed on a number of human rights activists in Bahrain last week, including Mr. Abdulhadi Al Khawaja, the former coordinator for the Irish NGO, Frontline.  I believe these harsh sentences should be revoked and all those who are charged with nothing more than peaceful protest should be released without further delay.Ireland's concerns are also shared by EU Partners with the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May having also adopted strong conclusions calling for the fair and transparent administration of justice and access for independent observers to ongoing legal proceedings, including in cases involving charges against medical professionals.  The need for Bahrain to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and its accountability regarding allegations of human rights violations including reported cases of torture and ill-treatment, was also underlined in the Council's Conclusions.The EU has also formally raised its concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities in Manama on 15 May and again on 19 June regarding the human rights situation and the repressive actions taken against medical staff.  With regard to the trials of the medical staff, the EU made clear that it was troubled that civilians were being tried in circumstances closely resembling those of military courts and urged the Bahraini authorities to respect the medical personnel's right to a fair trial and permit EU representatives and international or domestic organisations to observe the trials.  The EU also requested the Bahraini authorities to carry out a full investigation of alleged and documented human rights abuses committed during the past months, whomever the perpetrator, and immediately release all political prisoners.  The EU also raised the case of Mr Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, prior to his sentencing, at Ireland's request.Bilaterally, we have also made our views known in the fullest terms to the Bahraini authorities.  The Irish Ambassador in Riyadh met on 20 June with his Bahraini counterpart to inform him of the Government's deep concerns and to request the Ambassador to convey immediately to his authorities our view that all those who are charged with nothing more than peaceful protest should be released without further delay.  Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Bahrain, both bilaterally and in coordination with our EU partners, at all appropriate occasions.

This will take place in tandem with an equally significant programme of constitutional, political and institutional reform.  We want to ensure that there is a fundamental change in democratic and public governance, and a dramatic change in the cost efficiency and methods of delivery of public services.  It is clear that notwithstanding developments to-date, the cost of delivering public services must be reduced further, with fewer staff and tighter budgets, and that the Public Service must become better integrated and more customer-focused, as well as being leaner and more efficient.A key element of our strategy to bring about real and lasting change in the Public Service is the establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is an innovative development which reinforces the importance attached to delivering on the Public Service reform agenda, and the role which this Government believes a streamlined and high performing Public Service can play in our national recovery.  The Bill to formally establish the Department is expected to complete all stages in the Dáil and Seanad by the end of this week.The Government wants to make progress on this issue quickly and detailed implementation plans are being developed at present which will encompass the commitments to Public Service reform in the Programme for Government, including those which are the subject of these Parliamentary Questions.  The focus is on the key actions now required and how they will be implemented to ensure that substantive and tangible change is delivered within clearly defined timeframes.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The Government is committed to examining all aspects of public expenditure under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure with a view to ensuring where state programmes do continue that all resources are used in the optimum manner to deliver services to citizens.  One aspect of this review will be the rationalisation of state agencies.  The Government expects that this will go beyond simply abolishing agencies and also consider issues such as how existing agencies might be reformed, how functions might be reallocated among them, and how different bodies — within or beyond individual Ministers' remit — might be brought together on a repurposed, streamlined basis.  The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, in its Report of July 2009, set out a number of guiding principles that should in its view inform the Government's approach to agency rationalisation.  Taking account of these principles and developing them in light of the Government's priorities, the key principles to which the Government will have regard in this overall context are as follows:1. Citizen focus: The relationship between citizens and the State is the key relationship in any democratic society.  Proposals should respect and enhance this relationship, in particular by ensuring that agencies are designed to deliver quality public services, and to contribute effectively to the business of public administration whether directly or via their parent Department.2. Policy formulation: In the Irish system of public administration, Government Departments are and should be the primary locus of public policy formulation, evaluation and analysis.  Policy evaluation and advisory functions should not, as a general rule, be carried on by external State-funded agencies.  Specialist advice and consultancy may be availed of from time to time by Government Departments, subject to the tightened Government strictures on the budgets for external consultancies.3. Specialist agencies: Decisions should take into account whether it is appropriate that a separate agency carry out particular functions in areas where specialist skills may be required, and where independence in the performance of functions requires functional separation from Government Departments.4. Streamlining: Decisions should be cognisant of duplication, overlapping and similarities of functions and roles of agencies, and the synergies from bringing together separate bodies within cognate areas.5. Service sharing: Even where bodies should remain separate from one another, or from a ‘parent' Department, the possibility of sharing services, including back-office functions, should be explored to the maximum extent possible.6. Agency life cycle: Decisions should consider whether the goal for which an Agency was originally established has been achieved (or has been found to be unachievable) and whether the original objective remains relevant today having regard to developments in society, changes in Government priorities, and the much more limited availability of resources.7. Performance focus: Citizens are entitled to expect that every State agency has a clear mandate, clear benchmarks for the level of services that they are expected to deliver with their resources, and an appropriate governance structure that delivers accountability for results and performance.8. Respect for staff interests: Finally, in relation to the staff employed in the various agencies, the Government will abide by the commitments given in the Croke Park Agreement in considering and implementing specific agency rationalisation proposals, subject to the necessary flexibilities, in particular on redeployment, being delivered.

The interest rate charged to customers is determined by a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.  A balance must be maintained by the Government between support provided for individual banks and financial service providers generally through the bank guarantee scheme, other financial support incentives and broader public policy provisions, while at the same time ensuring that the day to day running of these institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long term credit needs of households and businesses in the Irish economy.

I have attended every one of these meetings.  Usually on the eve of the monthly Ecofin, the Eurogroup meets and again I have attended these monthly meetings also.  An extra Eurogroup meeting was called on 21 March to prepare the discussion on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for the March European Council. I also attended this meeting.  While I was abroad on official business in the US, Mr. Brian Hayes, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, attended a meeting of Ecofin on 14 June, which was called to discuss Economic Governance proposals.  This meeting was to discuss the state of play on the so called "Six-Pack" of legislative changes designed to strengthen the economic governance of the EU and to give a new mandate and political guidance, to the Hungarian Presidency in its ongoing negotiation with the European Parliament.  He also attended a meeting of the Eurogroup on the same day.The table below gives details of all meetings of EU Finance Ministers and Irish representation at them since the Government took office.Meeting TitleAttended By14 MarEurogroupMinister for Finance15 MarEcofinMinister for Finance21 MarEurogroupMinisterial meeting on the ESMMinister for Finance8-9 AprInformal Eurogroup/EcofinMinister for Finance16 MayEurogroupMinister for Finance17 MayEcofinMinister for Finance14 JunEurogroup & EcofinMinister of State at the Department of Finance19-20 JunEurogroup & Ecofin Ministerial meeting on the ESMMinister for Finance

These are matters in the first instance for the bank itself, the Central Bank of Ireland in its role as regulator and, should the customer wish to make a complaint the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Consumer Protection Code requires regulated entities to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers.  Such entities must not recklessly, negligently or deliberately mislead a customer as to the real or perceived advantages or disadvantages of any product or service. In accordance with common rule 12 of the Consumer Protection Code "a regulated entity must ensure that all information it provides to a consumer is clear and comprehensible, and that key items are brought to the attention of the consumer.  The method of presentation must not disguise, diminish or obscure important information."In the case of a customer experiencing financial difficulties in meeting his/her mortgage commitments or one who is concerned that he/she is in danger of going into financial difficulties, mortgage lenders must comply with the requirements of the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect on 1 January 2011.  A lender must have a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process in place incorporating communication with borrowers, financial information, assessment, resolution and appeals. In exploring all options for alternative repayment arrangements lenders must consider, inter alia, deferred payment, term extension, interest and partial capital payments and interest only arrangements.  The CCMA states that lenders "must not require the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, as part of any alternative arrangement offered to the borrower".

These included meetings with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, senior officials and representatives from various client companies and certain target IDA companies.  While in New York my engagements included meetings with legal and financial market advisers including an investor lunch  facilitated by the NTMA, a lunch hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as well as attending an official breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange. The purpose of these meetings was to have an exchange of views on the global and European financial situation while also addressing Irish specific issues.  I outlined the prospects for the Irish economy and the measures taken by Government to restructure the Irish banking system and promote economic growth.I also toured "Ireland House" in New York and met with officials from the various organizations located there, and also participated in Bloomsday celebrations.My visit to Washington involved a series of meetings with the IMF, World Bank, US Treasury and the US Chamber of Commerce.  A formal reception was also hosted by the Irish Ambassador where I had the opportunity to meet with a wide selection of business people, Congressmen and other interested parties.  Also while in the US, I had various press engagements including interviews with CNBC and Bloomberg.In line with common practice, I do not propose to provide the names of individuals who attended various meetings or engagements.  This could jeopardise potential investment and, for example, hamper the ability of organizations such as the IDA in developing confidential relationships with target companies.  I was accompanied on the trip by my Department's Second Secretary with responsibility for Bank Restructuring, Assistant Secretary in charge Budget and Economic matters, Press Officer, and my Special Advisor and Private Secretary.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	438	As the Deputy will be aware, the Euro Area Heads of State and Government agreed in principle to a reduction in the interest margin charged to programme countries. This has been applied to Greece and Portugal. However, a decision to apply it to Ireland's loans has not yet been taken. This is because another Member State is asking Ireland to deliver a quid pro quo in return for an interest rate reduction in the form of a change in our Corporation Tax. However, we have made it clear that we will not agree to this.  Contacts on interest rates are continuing at official level. I have raised it at EU Finance Ministers meetings, and in bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts, most recently at the Luxembourg meetings of the Eurogroup/ECOFIN Council. Furthermore, this issue was raised in the recent contacts that the Taoiseach had with President Sarkozy on the margins of last week's European Council meeting. While recognizing that the European focus is on the difficulties currently facing Greece, this government will continue to avail of every suitable opportunity to press our case for an interest rate reduction.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property.  The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001, which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area commenced with the signing of the valuation order on 5th May, 2011. This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013.It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas as soon as possible. The necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is under way with the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.It is not possible to say at present when revaluation will commence in Cork City and County or when the national programme will be completed.  A time frame of 10 years overall had been envisaged, but progress has been slower than expected, and the position has been complicated further by the difficult conditions in the property market in recent years. Nevertheless, the launch of the major project in Dublin City is a significant advance and the Commissioner has indicated that he is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The review work mentioned by the Deputy is continuing in my Department and the Valuation Office and is making progress. As previously mentioned, the Commissioner is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe. As mentioned in answer to recent questions, in this context, my officials are reviewing various provisions of the Act to achieve greater efficiencies, including streamlining the appeals process.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	441	At the outset I do not believe it is useful to characterise the intensive dialogue and engagement between the Irish authorities and its external partners, including the ECB, in the type of terms included in the Deputy's question.  Inevitably the issues that we discuss with the troika relating to the design and implementation of the Programme of Financial Support are often complex and sometimes sensitive and difficult.  However, notwithstanding the challenging nature of some of the negotiations we are involved in, we seek at all times to engage on a constructive and positive basis and that approach is reciprocated by the external parties.  It is important to be clear that the very substantial liquidity support that we continue to receive from the Eurosystem has been crucial for the maintenance of the stability of our banking system and for allowing it to continue to meet the credit needs of the economy, businesses and households.  It is also important to make the point that this funding is provided in accordance with the ECB's legal role, responsibility and mandate in respect of the eurozone.The Deputy will recall that the ECB announced following the release of the results of the Central Bank's stress tests on the banks at the end of March that the basis on which it provides this funding — in other words how it regards and values the collateral it accepts — would not change even in the event of a downgrade by ratings agencies. This demonstrates the strong and positive commitment of the ECB to underpinning the funding position of the Irish banks.As is well known the question of the scope for securing further burden sharing specifically and exclusively in respect of unguaranteed senior bonds in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society has previously been the subject of discussions with the external authorities.  I recently reiterated the Government's commitment to reviewing this matter afresh with the troika in view of the specific circumstances of those institutions and their future direction under the terms of the Programme agreement.  However, I have also made very clear that no unilateral action is contemplated by Ireland and the issue can only be progressed on an agreed basis in the context of the ongoing review and assessment process with our partners on the Programme.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	442	As provided for in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, a second reduced VAT rate of 9% is to be introduced on a temporary basis in respect of certain services and goods mainly related to tourism for the period 1 July 2011 to end 2013.  Specifically the 9% rate will apply to restaurant and catering services; hotel and holiday accommodation; various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions and fairgrounds/amusement parks, the use of sporting facilities; hairdressing services; and printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues, newspapers and magazines.  In reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, this measure is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.In order for the measure to be successful it requires the reduction in VAT to be passed on to consumers through a reduction in prices in the tourism sector. With this in mind, the VAT change announced in the Jobs Initiative will be kept under review and evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.I would point out that VAT is applied to particular goods and services and not in respect of individual retailers or firms.  Consequently, allowing the VAT reduction to retailers who pass on the reduction but not allowing it to retailers that do not pass on the reduction is not possible under either EU or Irish VAT legislation. While it is expected that the reduction in VAT will be passed on to the customer, whether it is passed on is however a matter for individual retailers.  The CSO published Consumer Price Index Detailed Sub-Indices will contain some information on price changes in various sectors e.g. the category headed "Restaurants and Hotels".
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Deputy will be aware that earlier this month I had written to representative bodies of the pensions industry with whom I had met on the pension fund levy issue, outlining my contention that the cost of the levy be absorbed by a reduction in the fees and charges made by their  members.  I have received a response from one of the representative bodies concerned. The response indicates that the question of the absorption of the cost of the levy into existing fees and charges is a matter for individual companies in respect of the pension schemes and personal pension plans to which they provide services. The letter went on to say, however, that the scope for those companies to absorb the levy is extremely limited.I will await developments in the coming months to see if, in fact, the pension fund administrators and providers have absorbed any of the pension fund levy this year. In the light of those developments, I would intend to pursue the matter further with them in the Autumn.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to a wide-ranging agenda of reform in relation to its budgetary architecture, including the establishment of a Fiscal Advisory Council. The commitment is set out both in the Programme for Government and the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  Details of the arrangements being put in place in relation to the Fiscal Advisory Council will be announced shortly. While the Council will be independent, it is envisaged that the Oireachtas will play an important role in relation to it. However, it is not envisaged that the initial nominees to the Council will go before the Joint Oireachtas Committee mentioned by the Deputy for approval.

Again Ministers do not receive such subsistence rates for attendance at their departments. The current rates are €33.62 for the 10 hour rate and €13.71 for the 5 hour rate.Where Ministers travel abroad including Northern Ireland they may claim for the vouched cost of a hotel room and up to 15% service charge plus the civil service Class A conference rate for the location increased by one third with the exception of the USA and Canada, where it is increased by a half. There are different rates depending on the location.  There are no other allowances currently payable in respect of Ministers and Ministers of State in my Department.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	446	In relation to the general question of access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), I am very conscious of the difficulties that are being faced by Irish businesses in this regard.  Support for the investments of SMEs is an operational priority for the European Investment Bank (EIB). To that end, the EIB signed loan agreements in 2009 with AIB and Bank of Ireland for €100 million each and with Ulster Bank for €60 million for onlending to SMEs for investment purposes.  I understand that AIB have fully allocated their funding and were approved for a further tranche of up to €150 million in November 2010.The European Investment Fund (EIF) provides venture capital for small businesses via venture capital funds and business incubators that support SMEs, as well as guarantees to financial institutions such as banks to cover their SME loans and guarantees.In relation to Structural Funds, under EU Cohesion Policy 2007-13, the European Commission has a number of joint initiatives with the EIB and EIF aimed at improving access to finance using financial engineering instruments.  One of these instruments, JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises), promotes SME access to finance in that national and regional authorities can opt to deploy money made available by the ERDF in the form of market-driven financial instruments, instead of offering grants.When Ireland's ERDF Structural Programmes 2007-13 were being developed, the JEREMIE programme was examined in the context of the existing arrangements in place to assist SMEs in accessing appropriate financial support.  Given the nature and structure of the JEREMIE programme, particularly in terms of the scale of operations that would be required to secure European Investment Fund participation, it was not considered suited to our Structural Funds programmes. This will be looked at again in the context of the next round of structuralfunding.The only source of loan finance co-funded by the EU in the Regional Operational Programmes is in the Microenterprises sub-priority. In this measure, County Enterprise Boards provide grant assistance to microenterprises. Some of this assistance can be in the form of a repayable loan which generates a revolving fund at the level of each County Enterprise Board. This is targeted at microenterprises, i.e., businesses with up to 10 employees and/or a turnover of less than €500,000.  No other loan funds are provided in the Regional Operational Programmes.A SME Guarantee Facility is available under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) 2007-2013 which provides additional guarantees to guarantee schemes, in order to increase the supply of debt finance to SMEs. It concentrates on addressing market failures in areas such as access to loans (or loan substitutes such as leasing) by SMEs with growth potential, provision of microcredit, and securitisation.The European Commission provides information on funding for SMEs on the European Small Business Portal which can be accessed at the following web address: http://ec.europa.eu/small-business/funding-partners-public/finance/index_en.htm. In addition, the website of the Enterprise Europe Network provide information on both national and EU financial supports http://www.enterprise-europe-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.I cannot say what impact the pension fund levy will have on individual funds or schemes, as this depends on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for. In that regard, I take the view that there is scope for the pensions industry to absorb the impact of the levy from fee income and charges and I have written to them in that regard.There are a number of factors influencing the decisions of individuals in relation to investments in pensions. Affordability would be among such considerations for some and the tax treatment of pension saving would be another. As regards the pension fund levy, I have consistently made the point that the 0.6% stamp duty on pension fund assets is a temporary measure to pay for the Jobs Initiative and will only be in place for the period of the Initiative.Arguably, the tax relief on pension contributions is a more relevant consideration in terms of long-term saving for supplementary pension provision. I am sure the Deputy is aware, as I am, that the pension fund levy comes at a time when the gradual reduction from marginal to standard rate tax relief on pension contributions forms part of the fiscal consolidation measures in the agreement with the EU Commission, IMF and the ECB over the period 2011 to 2014. When introducing the Jobs Initiative on 10 May last, I gave a commitment to examine this issue.The Government has initiated a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in order to provide it with a set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives and re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities.The Review is due to be completed by end September 2011.  The Government will then examine the findings and, in consultation with the EU, IMF and ECB, will introduce fiscally neutral changes to the detail of the EU /IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland while maintaining the overall commitment to fiscal consolidation.  I have undertaken to examine the scope for any change to the proposed standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions in that context.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	448	As I said at the time, the measures announced in the Jobs Initiative represent the first steps by this government to increase competitiveness in important sectors in the economy and to improve the functioning of our labour market. As the Deputy will appreciate, given the high level of uncertainty that continues to surround the outlook, it is very difficult to quantify the exact number of jobs that the Initiative will create.  From a sectoral perspective, the measures will help to support employment throughout the economy. In the labour intensive tourism sector, for example, the introduction of a temporary second reduced rate of VAT and reduction of the air travel tax to zero will have a positive impact on both costs and sentiment. In the construction sector there will be an increased focus on capital works which tend to be more labour intensive. More generally, the decision to halve the lower rate of PRSI until the end of 2013 on jobs that pay up to €356 per week will help to create and maintain jobs in the lower paid sectors of the economy.The following table outlines my Department's latest employment forecasts which were set out in the Irish Stability Programme Update published at end-April. Given that recovery in the labour market tends to lag that in the overall economy, a further decline in net employment is anticipated this year. This is borne out in recently published data, which show that net employment creation continued to decline in the first quarter of the year, but it did so at its slowest pace for three years.The economy should start to create net jobs once again in 2012, and the pace of employment growth should strengthen in subsequent years as the economic recovery strengthens and broadens out. Over the period 2012 to 2015 as a whole around 100,000 net jobs are expected to be created.201020112012201320142015Employment1,8481,8191,8281,8501,8821,921Level change-81-29+9+22+32+39Percentage change-4.2-1.6+0.5+1.2+1.8+2.0

The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.Securities depository companies usually manage, safekeep and administer the securities that it holds on behalf of the purchasers of the bonds and the identity of the purchasers of the bonds is not disclosed in the public domain or to the issuer.  As the identity of the purchasers of the bonds are not in the public domain, I cannot advise the Deputy the level and type of insurance these bondholders have.

All bilateral loans will be provided subject to the conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding agreed  with the EU/ECB/IMF.  At this point, no funds have yet been drawn down under the bilateral loan facilities with UK, Sweden and Denmark.The UK facility was signed in December 2010. The interest rate on the amounts drawn down will be based on the Sterling Pound mid-market semi-annual swap rate at the time of drawdown plus a margin of 2.29%.  At the time that the UK loan facility agreement was signed the overall interest cost was calculated at about 5.9%, similar to the blended rate calculated by the EU Commission at that time. As with all of the loans, the actual rate will depend on the market rates prevailing at the time of disbursement.In relation to the Danish and Swedish loan facilities, these have not yet been signed but are near completion. The interest rate on each will be based on the 3-month Euribor interest rate, a market reference rate of good standing, plus a margin yet to be agreed.

At the outset let me say that the reply given to the Deputy's question on 1 June was given by me and not my Officials.As far as my Officials attendance at Parliamentary Committees is concerned, let me assure the Deputy that it is not official policy to withhold information.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	453	The overriding concern for state procuring authorities in all contract negotiations is to ensure value for money and these procurements are conducted strictly under EU procurement directives and regulations.  The state does not enter into PPPs unless it can be clearly demonstrated that they provide value for money and there are a number of specific tests throughout the procurement and tender negotiation processes to ensure that best value is derived for the state.  Details of the timing and content of these value for money tests are set out in the various PPP guidance issued by the Department of Finance which are available on www.ppp.gov.ie.  A key factor for the state is not to lose advantage in its attempt to try to negotiate the best deal for the State — both in terms of costs and innovation.  The current PPP disclosure framework reflects international norms.The Deputy's proposal is well intentioned but in practical terms it raises a number of issues, for example, with respect to commercial sensitivities and may serve to lessen international interest in domestic PPP projects when in reality we would like to see as much interest as possible.I would emphasise that in PPPs, any forecast profit is fully at risk depending on the performance of the private partner over the full life of the contract, which is normally 25 years after construction.  This performance conditionality — which is particular to PPPs — puts the payments to private partner at risk, if the contracted standards are not met.  In PPPs, there is significant risk transfer from the State to the private sector.Moreover, if certain performance standards are not met, the contract can be terminated by the State.  The forecast profit is just that — a forecast — and does not take account of which risks, borne by the private sector, will materialise.  It is also important to recognise that the value can only be assessed over the full contract period, which can be up to 30 years.

The underpinning legislation for the scheme was subject to Commencement Order.  However, that legislation, on review, was found to have flaws and would have required amendment before it could be implemented.As part of the announcement in the recent Jobs Initiative, the Government undertook to provide further funding for the grants available under the Better Energy Homes scheme operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Because of these circumstances, I decided to review the requirement for a co-existing tax incentive for similar works and following this review, I have decided not to proceed with the introduction of the tax relief scheme.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 146 to 148, inclusive, together.The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) process was formally initiated by my colleague Mr. Brendan Howlin, T.D. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in early May.  The objectives of the review are to provide the Government with a full set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives, both as regards spending and numbers reduction targets, to re-align spending with the Programme for Government priorities and to consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the context of public sector reform.  Ministers and Departments have the responsibility to evaluate every budgetary programme for which they are responsible, within both Departments and Agencies.  The review is expected to be completed before the end of September, at which point the results of the process will be brought to Government for assessment as part of the Budget and Estimates process.On the broader point of expenditure evaluation, the CRE should be seen as part of a number of reforms designed to bring greater rigour to the allocation of scarce public resources and complement existing value for money arrangements.  In the past, our systems of resource allocation have been too focused on raw financial inputs, without enough regard to what is actually being produced.  It is necessary now to consider in greater the detail the actual outputs delivered from public expenditure and the impacts that this spending has.  As a first step in this process a pilot project has been undertaken as part of the 2011 Estimates which brings a greater focus on the link between the objectives, financial inputs, physical outputs and ultimate impacts of public spending programmes.  It is intended that this performance budgeting process be further rolled out as part of the 2012 Estimates process.These reforms complement the existing value for money architecture which includes ongoing evaluations of departmental expenditure.  The Value for Money and Policy Review initiative was launched in 2006, building on the Expenditure Review Initiative introduced in 1997.  The initiative focuses on evaluations of significant areas of expenditure and major policy issues.  To date, close to 200 such reviews have been carried out.  Under existing arrangements, there is a particular focus on the four major areas of expenditure: namely the Health, Education, Social Protection and Justice sectors.  These four sectors conduct one review per year, while all other line Departments plus the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works are required to carry out 2 reviews each in a three year period.Minister Howlin and his new Department will be reviewing the effectiveness of these arrangements, to ensure that a proper culture of rigorous evaluation and value-for-money is delivered across the public service.  This evaluation culture should encompass all stages of programme design and delivery, from ex-ante through to ex-post ; and should apply across all types of expenditure programmes, covering current as well as capital.

Questions were asked previously on 27th May 2010, 8th July 2010, 29th September 2010, 4th November 2010 and the 19th May 2011 about this matter.  The facts remain as follows:Following a Revenue audit, deductions incorrectly claimed by the taxpayer were withdrawn, giving rise to a significant tax liability.Relevant Contract Tax credit of  €23,530.25 was offset against an audit tax liability leaving a net refund of €509.53.Revenue wrote to the taxpayer on the 28th Sep 2010 requesting acceptance of the audit settlement proposals.  Reminder letters issued to the taxpayer on the 1st Dec 2010 and 30th March 2011 again requesting acceptance of the audit settlement proposals. To date the taxpayer has neither accepted or rejected these proposals.The Revenue Commissioners would request that the taxpayer responds to the three unanswered letters so as to expedite the closure of the matter.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.To date, Ireland's nominal borrowings under the EU/IMF Programme amount to €23 billion.  Details of the loans disbursed to date as supplied by the NTMA to my Department are set out in the table.  The information includes the dates of draw downs, the amounts, the maturity or term, the equivalent annual interest rates based on the total costs of the loans, the date of the next coupon and the interest due to be paid on those dates.  It should be noted that the next coupon date is also the first coupon date in respect of loans from the EFSF and the EFSM.  The first coupon date for IMF loans was in April this year.There have been no draw downs to date from our bilateral loan partners, the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  The UK loan agreement has been finalised for some time and it stipulates that the interest rate on the amounts drawn down will be based on the Sterling Pound mid-market semi-annual swap rate at the time of drawdown plus a margin of 2.29%.In relation to the Danish and Swedish loan facilities, these have not yet been signed but are near completion.  The interest rate on each will be based on the 3-month Euribor interest rate, a market reference rate of good standing, plus a margin yet to be agreed.LenderNominal Loan amountAmount DisbursedDate  of Draw downMaturity from date of receipt.Interest Rate used to calculate ongoing paymentsNext Coupon date and frequencyInterest payment due at next coupon date(Borrowing Cost including margin but excluding fees and credit enhancement measures)EFSM See note 1€5.00 billion€4.973 billion12-Jan-114 years 11 months5.425%05-Dec-11 (Annual)€243 million€3.40 billion€3.39 billion24-Mar-117 years6.175%04-Apr-12 (Annual)€216 million€3.00 billion€2.986 billion31-May-1110 years6.425%04-Jun-12 (Annual)€195 millionEFSF See note 2€4.20 billion3

Overall Total€23.02 billion€22.36 billion6.83 years; weighted average life1. The current SDR floating rate (2.345%) on the IMF drawdown reflects the lower rate arising from a quota increase for Ireland on 4th March 2011. The estimated Euro Equivalent rate on credit outstanding is 4.77% (pricing 31st May 2010) after hedging. The interest rate has been calculated on the basis of the total disbursements to date from the IMF.2. Estimated figures based on the current SDR interest rate, which is reset weekly.3. This is the loan amount.  The disbursement made available to the Exchequer from the EFSF is €3.592 billion after credit enhancement measures. This credit enhancement is to ensure that the EFSF retains its top AAA credit rating and, thereby, minimizes the cost of funds it borrows. Under the only EFSF loan to Ireland to date, €0.6 billion was retained thereby reducing the cash available to Ireland to €3.592 billion. The retained amount is the present value of the margin of 247 basis points over the life of the loan.4. 5.22% is the coupon of 2.75% plus the margin of 2.47%. Taking credit enhancements and service fees into account the effective cost to Ireland is 5.90%.Note 1 EFSM:The first coupon date of the EFSM loan drawn down on the 12th January 2011 is 5th December 2011 when €243 million is payable. Thereafter, interest of €272 million is payable on an annual basis (5 December each year) to maturity.  With regard to the disbursement of 24 March 2011, the date of the first coupon payment means that the first interest rate period is slightly over a year and the amount reflects this.  The annual interest payable on 4 April in 2013 and subsequent years will be €210 million.  The same issue arises in respect of the 31 May 2011 disbursement.  The annual interest payable on 4 June in 2013 and subsequent years will be €193 million.Note 2 EFSF:The first coupon date of the only EFSF loan drawn down to date occurs on the 18 July 2011.  As the first coupon is only in respect of the period from the 1st of February 2011 to 18 July 2011, €53 million of interest is payable.  Thereafter interest is calculated on an annual basis.  As Ireland has already prepaid the margin of 2.47%, the annual interest payment of €115 million relates only to the EFSF cost of funding, which was 2.75% in respect of this loan tranche.  This interest rate is fixed for the lifetime of the loan.Note 3 IMF:Interest will be paid quarterly at the IMF's standard interest rate for drawings under its Extended Fund Facility.  This rate is set by reference to the IMF's basic rate of charge plus surcharges which are based on the size of the loan relative to the country's IMF quota.For borrowings up to three times quota the interest rate is the SDR rate (currently 0.58%) plus 1%.Borrowings above the threshold of three times quota are charged an additional 2%.From 18 January 2014, the third anniversary of the availability of the 1st disbursement of the IMF funds to Ireland, an additional 1% is charged on borrowings over 3 times quotaIn addition to the interest charge there is a once off up front handling fee of 0.5% for all draw downs.The SDR interest rate is reset weekly and is based on a weighted average of the three-month Eurepo rate, three-month Japanese Treasury Discount bills, three-month UK Treasury bills, and three-month US Treasury bills.  The current SDR interest rate is 0.58%.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	473	During an ongoing crisis, it is important for relationships between institutions to be developed, in order to allow for confidential negotiations to take place, especially on particularly sensitive issues.  This is particularly the case in relation to the Irish authorities dealing with the ECB.  It is normal practice for states to protect the confidentiality of these discussions, and in fact is usually enshrined in the rules of association of institutions.  Indeed, this is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, which provides for exemptions for records relating to, for example, information received in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the financial and economic interests of the state in sections 24, 26 and 31.  These factors counterbalance the public interest, protecting the ability of the Government when negotiating or deliberating on matters of national importance.  It is considered that release of these records would impact on the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant degree without a countervailing benefit to the public, and would prejudice our relationship with the ECB.  For this reason, I do not intend to release this information.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.My Department will publish a pre-Budget Outlook in October of this year and, as is the norm, it is intended that Budget 2012 will be presented to the Dáil in early December, though the exact date has yet to be decided.  Similarly, while the exact dates have not been set, the Revised Estimates Volume would normally be published in February 2012 and referred to the relevant Dáil Select Committees on the same date.  The Estimates are then voted on by the House in June. In relation to 2011, the Revised Estimates for Public Expenditure 2011   will be published shortly and will reflect the main changes following the re-organisation of Departmental responsibilities, the Jobs Initiative and minor administrative adjustments such as the introduction of civilian drivers for Ministers.The Deputy will also be aware, of course, of the arrangements introduced this year under the new EU-semester, whereby the Stability Programme Update, containing revised macroeconomic and budgetary projections, was prepared and submitted to the European Commission last April.  This document was also laid before the Dáil and published on the Department of Finance website.  The purpose of these new arrangements is to allow for a more intensive period of peer review of other member-states' budgetary plans, thereby facilitating a greater degree of budgetary coordination across the EU, and they form part of a wider suite of fiscal governance reforms which are emerging at EU-level.Finally, I, as the Minister for Finance, and Brendan Howlin, as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, along with our respective Departments, will work very closely in the compilation of Budget 2012, as the expenditure estimates are obviously a key factor in devising budgetary policy and calculating the overall budgetary arithmetic.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The overall fiscal adjustment for 2012 underpinning the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support is €3.6 billion and this will be implemented through a combination of further reductions to public expenditure and additional revenue raising measures.  The Stability Programme Update submitted to the European Commission in April forecasts the 2012 General Government deficit at 8.6% of GDP.  Based on the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook at the time, this target is consistent with this level of fiscal adjustment and is within the terms of the revised Excessive Deficit Procedure recommendation issued by the ECOFIN Council last December.As stated in the revised programme agreed with the EU/IMF in April 2011, the budgetary measures set out in the original agreement in December 2010 will be examined by the Government.  Therefore the precise nature of the measures to be implemented in 2012 will be decided upon in advance of Budget 2012 in light of more up-to-date economic and fiscal data and the outcome of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, which is currently under way.

I have also indicated that we will take no unilateral action in this area.  While legislation is in place to provided for burden sharing with subordinated debt holders under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 there are currently no provisions on the statute book to specifically provided for burden sharing with senior bondholders.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	477	Future disbursements are kept under constant review and are the subject of discussion in the quarterly reviews.  Disbursements in each quarter can only take place after the IMF Executive Board, the Eurogroup and ECOFIN have approved the compliance reports prepared, respectively, by IMF Staff and the European Commission Services.  The actual disbursements take place in the period following the respective meetings.  Disbursements from the EFSF and EFSF are somewhat dictated by the timing of their market interventions and discussions around this are held with the NTMA as appropriate.Under the combined 1st and 2nd Reviews, which took place in April 2011, the disbursement profile  was agreed as set out in the following table:SourceQ3—2011Q4—201120122013TotalsEU (incl. Bilaterals)*€3.0 bn€7.7 bn€12.7 bn€6.6 bn€30.0 bnIMF€1.5 bn€3.9 bn€6.3 bn€3.4 bn€15.1 bnTotal€4.5 bn€11.6 bn€19.0 bn€10.0 bn€45.1 bn*These are net disbursement figures.  Gross borrowing will be higher due to the credit enhancement measures required under EFSF arrangements.The funds to be sourced from the EU includes an estimated €4.8 billion of bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  Under the bilateral agreement with the UK worth a total value of Stg£3.2 billion (€3.8 billion, based on the conversion rates prevailing in November 2010, is the assumed value in the table above), the funds should be disbursed in eight equal tranches starting in the third quarter of 2011.  The bilateral loan agreements, including the disbursement profiles, with Sweden and Denmark are being finalised.  The current expectation is that the combined €1 billion from these sources will be split equally between 2012 and 2013 and this is reflected in the table.

The policy of these bodies is to engage external resources to work with in-house staff as and when the need arises.  Additional time is required to source the information sought by the Deputy on the Office of Public Works, the Public Appointments Service and the Valuation Tribunal.  The information regarding these bodies will be forwarded directly to the Deputy when it comes to hand.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I would like to inform the Deputy that there are a number of measures in place to assist mortgage holders who are in genuine difficulties with regard to the payment of their mortgages.  The Deputy will be aware of the work of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  This Group published its final Report in November 2010.  All of the Expert Group's recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Report which can be accessed at www.finance.gov.ie .One of the recommendations of the Group was that lenders should offer a Deferred Interest Scheme (DIS) to borrowers.  Under this Scheme, borrowers are allowed, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to 5 years.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the Group's proposals for a DIS or a variation of it.  While the scheme is voluntary for all lenders, those who have signed up in support of the scheme will be monitored by the Central Bank to ensure compliance.Since the publication of the Group's Report, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) has been revised by the Central Bank to reflect many of the recommendations, including key recommendations relating to the introduction by all regulated lenders of a standardised Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  The most significant changes in the revised CCMA include:Penalty interest charges may not be imposed on borrowers in arrears who co-operate with the MARP,Harassment of borrowers through unsolicited communications is outlawed,Borrowers in financial difficulties, but not in arrears, are allowed to come under the MARP,When a lender is determining the 12 month period the lender must wait before applying to the courts to commence legal action, the lender must exclude   any time period during   which a borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement, making an appeal to the internal appeals board or making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The revised CCMA came into effect on 1 January 2011 and can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie.  Lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law but have been given a period of six months grace ending on 30 June 2011 to put in place the requisite systems and training of staff necessary to support the implementation of the MARP.The recommendation of the Group to amend the local authority needs assessment process has been implemented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Local authorities have been provided with guidance on the treatment of applicants for social housing support whose mortgages have been deemed unsustainable.  Discussions are on-going between that Department and the Irish Bankers' Federation to enable borrowers, whose properties are to be repossessed to remain in their homes for a period of time, pending the sourcing of appropriate accommodation by the housing authority.As regards the recommendations of the Group in relation to the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme (MIS), I have been informed by the Department of Social Protection that the implementation of these recommendations will require changes to both primary and secondary legislation.  That Department is currently finalizing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the MIS.I note the proposal made by the Deputy, whereby a borrower would pay an amount equivalent to the rent that the property could reasonably be expected to realise if put on the open market, in lieu of the actual amount of the mortgage due, thereby lengthening the time for full repayment of the mortgage.  I have no plans to introduce such a scheme at this time.  Finally, people in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.

The underpinning legislation for the scheme was subject to Commencement Order.  However, that legislation, on review, was found to have flaws and would have required amendment before it could be implemented.As part of the announcement in the recent Jobs Initiative, the Government undertook to provide further funding for the grants available under the Better Energy Homes scheme operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Because of these circumstances, I decided to review the requirement for a co-existing tax incentive for similar works and following this review, I have decided not to proceed with the introduction of the tax relief scheme.  As the tax relief scheme will now not come into effect, there is no need to complete the economic impact assessment that was planned.

The European Commission approved the EGF application in September 2010 while the formal decision from the EGF Budgetary authority approving the application was made on 8 December 2010.  That decision provides for a maximum 65% EGF co-financed contribution of €7.4m to be used for EGF programme measures from 25 March 2009, the date when programme supports commenced nationally, up to 9 October 2011, the EGF programme end date.The significant lapse of time between EGF application submission by the EU Member State and EU approval is a feature of the EGF and one which Ireland has raised with the European Commission.  Notwithstanding the fact that EU approval is received several months after an EGF application submission, the cost of eligible measures provided immediately after, or even prior to, the redundancy of an EGF eligible person, may be claimed from the EGF if included in the relevant application from the EU member state.As I have previously stated in the House on a number of occasions in recent weeks on this issue, the end date of EGF co-financing of relevant supports for the SR Technics redundant workers must cease on 9 October 2011 in accordance with the European Commission decision.  This end-date has always been made clear to both the providers of supports to the redundant workers including in written correspondence and to the redundant workers wishing to avail of those supports including at public meetings and at meetings with worker representatives.  In this context, it was always made clear to the former S R Technics workers and their representatives both at public meetings and at meetings held at their request with officials of my Department, that the full duration of third level education courses would not be funded through the EGF programme and that funding would end before accreditation is achieved.Under the EGF Regulation governing the Fund, EU co-financing for a maximum amount of 65% of the total cost of an EGF programme of measures is available for a maximum of 24 months from the date of submission of an application by a Member State.  The nationally funded EGF allocation is used for the sole purpose of providing the remaining minimum 35% national co-financed contribution for eligible measures forming part of the overall EGF programme for the duration of the programme only.  No additional national funding is available to fund continued study on EGF-related education courses after 9 October 2011 outside the normal funding available to all students.

They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.  There is therefore no panel system in place for SNAs.A Special Needs Assistant whose post is surplus to the approved allocation to the school may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the terms of circular 58/2006 — titled Redundancy Arrangements for Special Need Assistants.  Support to SNAs who may have been made redundant is provided for within the terms of this scheme.The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  The Board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for SNA support for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and are currently in the process of informing schools of their annual SNA allocation for the coming school year.

An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.As the scope of works for the refurbishment element of this project is outside the terms of the Emergency Works Scheme it cannot be considered for emergency funding.  The school has been informed of the decision.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department recently approved emergency funding for the provision of the disabled access facilities at the school in question.

Upon completion of that review my Department officials will respond directly to the Board of Management.Until planning permission has been secured and the advanced stages of architectural planning have been completed, it will not be possible to give an indication of the timeframe for completion of the subsequent tender and construction stages.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The school referred to by the Deputy is one of 8 new schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership (PPP).  The procurement of these schools is ongoing and it is expected that subject to the successful completion of the tendering and local authority planning process that a contract for the delivery of these schools will be finalised in early 2012.The Department of Education and Skills operates the Design Build Finance and Maintain (DBFO) model for PPP projects.  This provides that the maintenance of the buildings over the 25 year period of the contract becomes the responsibility of the PPP Operator and ancillary staff currently employed by the school will be given the option, under EU legislation, of transferring their employment to the PPP Company.Officials from my Department met with representatives of the ancillary staff of the school mentioned by the Deputy in April 2011 and committed that all available options will be presented to the staff in question at the earliest opportunity.  It will not be possible to do this in advance of the appointment of a successful tenderer and a scheduled completion date being finalised.  At that point further discussions will take place with the relevant staff to ensure the full suite of available options can be presented.I would also like to point out that the Government has given certain commitments to public servants under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 including a commitment that compulsory redundancy will not apply within the public service, save where existing exit provisions apply.  Accordingly, for the lifetime of the Public Service Agreement, any serving public servants in the VEC who decide following the presentation of the full suite of options, that they do not wish to transfer to the PPP company are protected from compulsory redundancy, subject to them agreeing to re-deployment to another public service position in line with the provisions in that respect contained in the Agreement.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 182 together.I wish to inform the Deputy that school transport arrangements under the Closed School Rule originated from the last major amalgamation of schools in the late 1960s. Under the Closed School Rule, transport is generally provided to the school of amalgamation for pupils who reside in a closed school area. However, over the course of the last forty two years, many parts of Ireland have experienced changes in population, the number of schools in an area may have increased and private transport is more widely available. While my Department acknowledges the importance of school transport, my Department must always seek to ensure that every service that is funded by the public is operated in a manner that delivers for pupils, parents and taxpayers alike.Changes to school transport services relating to the Closed School Rule and the minimum number of eligible pupils required to retain or establish a school transport service were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.Regarding the Closed School Rule (CSR) it is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of this rule. The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport. In such cases, these children may apply for concessionary transport.A further change which will take effect in September 2011 is the increase from 7 to 10 in the number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to retain or establish a school transport service. In general, this means that the minimum number required to establish or retain a service broadly represents a return to 2002 levels. Again it is important to stress that families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for a grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.

Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science (Skills) to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.  This includes provision for students learning through ISL.A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:the special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parentsfunding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.The Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly. Services provided include communication therapy and lip-reading classes as well as sign language classes.My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design. The HEA has allocated €387,000 in core funding to the Centre in the current academic year.Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has commissioned an external, high-level review of the issues surrounding deaf education. This review will focus on models of provision with reference to evidenced-based outcomes and the implications of adopting different approaches. I look forward to receiving the policy advice from the NCSE in this regard.

This includes the allocation of Resource Teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.I understand that with regard to the school referred to by the Deputy, that the class for pupils with Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) in the school will not be sanctioned by the NCSE for the coming school year, as the school does not have the minimum number of pupils required to retain such a class.In relation to the allocation of individual Resource Teaching support, Departmental Circulars 30/2011 and 37/2011 provide information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year.For the coming 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations has been made to schools, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and to ensure that the DES can remain within Employment Control Framework obligationsSchools have been asked to forward any outstanding applications, or additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the NCSE for their consideration, as soon as possible, but in any event by no later than 16th September 2011.  Having considered all of the outstanding applications received from schools by September 16th, depending on the level of demand, the NCSE may be in a position to revisit the 90% allocation of Resource Teaching hours made to date for schools.

Financial support is also available to students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in the form of student grants. In addition, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries. Detailed information on all financial supports for students can be found on the website www.studentfinance.ie.The implementation issues associated with introducing a student loan scheme were previously assessed by the Department of Education and Skills in the context of policy options for new forms of student contribution. A July 2009 technical report on these policy options, including the introduction of a loan scheme, is published on the Department's website.Future demand for participation growth in higher education needs to be reconciled with limitations on public resources and a need to protect and enhance core quality. Although the nature of these difficult trade-offs are described in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, the strategy also identifies the need for more detailed analysis. In this regard, I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake further work on the sustainability of the existing funding framework over the course of this year. This work will inform consideration by Government of policy options in relation to future funding of the sector.

At the time of starting a Springboard course an applicant also must be in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit or One Parent Family Payment or be signing for contribution credits and be available and actively seeking employment.  The rationale for applying a 6 months waiting criteria is to ensure that the limited resources available for Springboard are directed at unemployed people, who may be in  most need of upskilling or reskilling in order to get back into employment.

However, the Deputy may be aware that under section 18 of the Education Act, schools are  required "to keep all proper and usual accounts and records of all monies received by it or expenditure of such monies incurred by it and shall ensure that in each year all such accounts are properly audited or certified in accordance with best accounting practice". Section 18 of the Act further requires that "Accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall be made available by the school concerned for inspection by the Minister and by parents of students in the school, in so far as those accounts relate to monies provided in accordance with Section 12 of the Act."The Deputy may be referring to the commitment in the Programme for Government that "Schools will publish annual reports". The precise nature of such reports and the timeframe for the implementation of this commitment is currently the subject of consideration by my Department.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I wish to inform the Deputy that school transport arrangements under the Closed School Rule originated from the last major amalgamation of schools in the late 1960s.  Under the Closed School Rule, transport is generally provided to the school of amalgamation for pupils who reside in a closed school area. However, over the course of the last forty two years, many parts of Ireland have experienced changes in population, the number of schools in an area may have increased and private transport is more widely available.  While my Department acknowledges the importance of school transport, my Department must always seek to ensure that every service that is funded by the public is operated in a manner that delivers for pupils, parents and taxpayers alike.The changes to school transport services relating to the Closed School Rule were announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.It is important to stress that there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR).The first of these, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR. This means that children residing less than 3.2 kilometres from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport.This change to school transport provision means that the distance eligibility criterion of 3.2 kilometres will be applied uniformly and equitably on a national basis. In line with the terms of the national primary school transport scheme, children residing less than 3.2kms may only apply for concessionary transport subject to a number of conditions including payment of a charge, currently of €200 per annum. There is no exemption from this charge.

It is within this context that my Department is finalising its analysis of all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required at post primary level up to 2017.  Overall post-primary requirements in the area to which the Deputy refers will be considered as part of this process and an appropriate long term accommodation solution to the needs of the area will be considered in the context of my Department's Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme and with due regard to available financial resources.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	507	According to information supplied by FÁS to my Department, as at 31st May 2011, the number of apprentices notified to FÁS by employers as being redundant was 5,118.  The number of redundant apprentices who can progress in their apprenticeships having reached the minimum qualifying standard to date in off-the-job training and assessment is 3,185 and 1,933 redundant apprentices cannot progress until they have successfully passed their outstanding assessmentsA number of initiatives have been taken by FÁS to enable registered redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships:The rules for off-the-job training were amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship even though they have not yet completed their previous on-the-job phase.  This year to date, 774 have completed off-the-job training and 452 are currently attending off-the-job training.The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme.  In order to provide opportunities to assist redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships, FÁS approved employers in the public and private sectors will provide redundant apprentices with training and assessment on-the-job at Phase 3, Phase 5 and Phase 7.  As of  17th June 2011, 960 redundant apprentices are currently in on-the-job training phase with employers, and 167 have completed the relevant phase.  The scheme aims to provide placement and training for 1,526 redundant apprentices in 2011.Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments.  Redundant apprentices in the trades of Carpentry & Joinery, Cabinet Making, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick & Stonelaying and Plastering who have successfully completed Phase 1 to Phase 6 of their apprenticeships but who have not completed on-the-job Phase 7 Assessments will be scheduled by FÁS to undertake Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments over a period of 4 weeks in a FÁS Training Centre. As at 31st May 2011, 22 redundant apprentices had completed the assessments and 7 redundant apprentices are currently in training.  Redundant apprentices eligible to undertake the assessments have been notified by FÁS.Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme.  Redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phase 1 to Phase 7 of their apprenticeships but who have not completed the statutory 4 years in employment as apprentices may be granted an exemption from this requirement by validating their competence under the Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme. FÁS will invite qualifying redundant apprentices to submit a portfolio of evidence of trade related work experience gained at home and/or abroad and/or trade related training and education. The granting of exemptions is based solely on the portfolios of evidence submitted.  As at 31st May 2011, 172 application have been approved and a further 20 applications are in progressFee Waiver Scheme.  Course fees will be waived for redundant apprentices who attend FÁS day and/or evening courses in order to enhance their employable skills.Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses and evening courses available at FÁS Training Centres to enhance their employable skillsCertificate in Craft Transferable Skills. FÁS and the Higher Education Authority with the Institutes of Technology have developed a post Phase 6 programme for redundant apprentices who wish to access a programme at 3rd level in the Institutes of Technology.  Redundant apprentices who successfully complete this programme will receive a HETAC Special Award Level 3, 30 ECTS Credits.  This award should entitle apprentices to enter year 2 of a relevant Higher Certificate (level 6) and in some particular cases may gain entry to Ordinary Degree Programmes Level 7.  The Certificate in Craft Transferable Skills (optional) will be offered by the Institutes of Technology in Term 1 — 2011/2012Refresher Programme for Redundant Referred Apprentices. To assist referred apprentices who wish to progress, FÁS and the Institutes of Technology have developed a short duration programme to prepare redundant apprentices to repeat their outstanding assessments, and this programme will be offered by the Institutes of Technology in Term 1 — 2011/2012Léargas has provided support to FÁS for apprentices to complete on-the-job training with assessment with employers in Germany and Finland.  In the period to the end of May 2011, over 100 apprentices have undertaken the programme and FÁS has received approval subject to contract for a further 43 redundant apprentice placement in 2011/2012Conversion Programme — Electrical /Plumbing.  FÁS has developed a Conversion Programme for redundant Electrical and Plumbing apprentices who have worked primarily in the Construction Sector to undertake additional training in modules associated with the Manufacturing and Facility Maintenance Sectors.  The pilot programme provides a combination of off and on-the-job training in a FÁS Training Centre and with work experience in the Manufacturing and Facility Maintenance Sectors.

A mid-term review of this plan is being finalised for publication. This indicates that there is steady progress towards the objectives and targets in the national plan Key achievements include the development of access and lifelong learning plans for all higher education institutions funded by the HEA. These include plans for the continuation and development of programmes of work with young people and adults in schools and communities, particularly those in areas with high levels of socio-economic disadvantage and unemployment.Work has also advanced on the development of broader routes of access, such as the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) for those with a disability. Following the release of the results of the 2011 census, further work will be undertaken on measurement of participation by target socio-economic groups.Work on supporting the return to education by mature students has included the development of new part-time and flexible learning options, such as the Bluebrick and Labour Market Activation/Springboard initiatives. Significant progress is also being made on the reform and modernisation of student supports through the implementation of the Student Support Act 2011 by the Department of Education and Skills. Other measures to support broader access and participation include the continued allocation of the special rate of student grant, targeting students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds; the allocation of over €15 million in Third Level Access funding for the direct support of students through the Fund for Students with Disabilities and the Student Assistance Fund. In 2011 the core recurrent funding to HEA-funded institutions was developed to include a targeted access element, the allocation of which is now linked to the number of students from target access groups participating in each higher education institution.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.

The programmes in Irish offered at both levels have the capacity to cater for a wide diversity of abilities.Departmental circular M10/94 applies to post primary schools funded by my Department and sets out the exceptional circumstances where an exemption from the study of Irish may be granted to post primary pupils.  Under the terms of this circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, is vested in school management.At post-primary level French is not a compulsory subject for the Junior Certificate, traditional Leaving Certificate or Applied Leaving Certificate programmes.  However as part of the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) a modern European language, such as French, is a requirement.  A LCVP student may be exempted from the study of a modern European language where he/she already has an exemption from the study of Irish.With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the student's parents/guardians should make a written application to the management of the school in which the student is enrolled, clearly stating the grounds on which they are seeking an exemption from the study of Irish.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I wish to advise the Deputy that the primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum.  In addition, the Deputy might note that school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.However, I do recognise that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community.  To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools in March 2005 urging Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes.Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending  the school are prioritised in the first instance.My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal County area of Dublin with the Local Authority and Developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing.  I believe this model can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.My Department's position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use.  Of utmost importance, schools should  ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school's insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.

As this service will fall under the minimum number of 10 eligible pupils, this service will be withdrawn for the 2011/12 school year.As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Under Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, the curriculum in schools is subject to my approval, following any consultation considered appropriate with the partners in education and the advice of National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The NCCA has been asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform designed to strengthen literacy and numeracy, embed key skills, promote active learning and enhanced creativity and innovation, and ensure appropriate ways of generating evidence of learning.  Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload, and rote learning.The Council has completed a public consultation process and is finalising its advice to me on the direction of reform, in consultation with the partners in education.  I expect the Council's advice in the Autumn.  In advance of receipt of the detail of these proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to set out a definitive timeframe for implementation at this stage.I would like to see movement on this for students entering second level in September 2012, but detailed implementation will need to be considered in the context of the proposals being presented and the resources available, and the need to prioritise the national literacy and numeracy strategy.I am aware that teachers of history and geography have raised concerns that their subjects will no longer be compulsory.  The requirement to study history and geography in a secondary school but to have different options in vocational schools is a historical anomaly which is no longer appropriate.  I believe that students should have as wide a choice as is feasible in their schools given the overall level of student demand and interest, the teaching resources available, and the qualifications profile of staff.  The importance of history and geography in promoting critical analysis skills, interculturalism, an understanding of human development, democracy, past and current world issues, and the skills for an environmentally sustainable life are fully appreciated. I will be guided by the NCCA's advice in this matter.

The CEB's unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.I would advise the promoter to contact their appropriate CEB; Kerry County Enterprise Board in the first instance to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture.  The Board is located at the County Buildings, Rathass, Tralee, Co. Kerry; Phone No: 066 718 3522, Fax No: 066 712 6712: Email: kerryceb@kerrycoco.ie Website: www.kerryenterprise.ie
To be eligible for CEB grant support an enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people.  CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants.  The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I assume that the Deputy is referring to licences for selling goods under the Casual Trading Act, 1995.The selling of goods in public places is governed by the Casual Trading Act, 1995.  Under this legislation the regulation of selling goods in public places is devolved to the 88 local authorities entitled to make bye laws under the Act.  The bye laws made by local authorities under the Act deal with such matters as the fee to be paid, the location of casual trading areas (or trading pitches), access to trading pitches, the hours within which selling may take place, etc.  Any person selling goods in a public place covered by local authority bye laws must be the holder of a casual trading licence issued by the local authority.  Thus the question of traders who wish to sell goods in a specific place should be more properly addressed to the local authority in the area in which they wish to trade. I have no direct function in the issuing of these licences.A local authority may refuse to grant a casual trading licence if (a) the person fails to furnish a completed application form, (b) the person fails to pay the appropriate fee and (c) a trading place is not available.  There is also provision for a local authority to refuse the grant of a licence to persons convicted of offences under the Act.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	524	EU Member States are required to transpose the provisions of the EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work (2008/14/EC) into national law by 5 December 2011.A central objective of the Directive is that Member States afford protection to temporary agency workers by applying the principle of equal treatment in terms of the basic working and employment conditions e.g. pay, annual holidays etc. to agency workers in the same way as applies to workers that are directly recruited by a hirer undertaking to do the same job.My Department initiated a public consultation on the national transposition of the directive in October last.  Observations were provided by a number of stakeholders and interested parties and this has resulted in follow-up bilateral meetings between my Department and a number of respondents to further elaborate on positions.  This is now informing the preparation of draft legislation by my Department to be approved by the Government in advance of the publication of a Bill.  The timeline for publication of the Bill will have regard to the tight legislative timeline in order to meet the transposition deadline.An important feature of the Directive is the possibility for the conclusion of a Framework Agreement, by the social partners at the national level which would allow for a "waiting period" to apply before equal treatment applies.  In the UK, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress concluded a Framework Agreement that allows for a waiting period of 12 weeks before equal treatment will apply.  The Government attaches significant importance to the conclusion of a Framework Agreement in the context of Ireland's national transposition in order to maintain our cost competitiveness vis-à-vis our main trading partners in Europe and we will be working with the Social Partners towards that end.

His role also incorporates legal metrology, implementation of the restructuring of the County and City Enterprise Boards, driving the Better Business Regulation agenda, promoting greater access to procurement opportunities for SMEs, developing the Green Economy, and overseeing coordination and ongoing rollout of Internal market policy generally including coordination of Ireland's position on the EU's Single Market Act.The responsibilities for Minister of State Sherlock cover a broad range of activities across science, technology, innovation and intellectual property where Ireland's performance will be critical to recovery and future economic prosperity.  A key focus will be driving the Innovation and Commercialisation commitments of the Programme for Government.  Specific responsibilities include the Programme for Research in Third Level institutions, promoting industry collaboration with the Third Level sector, transforming Research and Development activity in enterprise, realising the commercial potential of Ireland's research, working with Science Foundation Ireland to build and excellent science base in strategic areas relevant to the competitiveness of enterprise, and a range of other non-legislative functions.Delegation of Functions Orders giving effect to these functions were signed by An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D., on 24 May 2011.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	527	This Government has made its commitment to ensuring that the appropriate infrastructure is in place to facilitate an environment where enterprise can flourish and sustainable jobs can be created clear through its Programme for Government, which outlines the measures that will be explored to maximise enterprise development.The establishment of business incubation centres on higher education campuses across Ireland is supported by capital investment from my Department's Vote, provided through Enterprise Ireland (EI).  Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups.  They differ from other types of space in the supportive environment in that they offer client companies services such as:Business mentoring from a dedicated centre manager and a local network of experts;The opportunity to leverage academic R&D expertise;Access to specialised facilities that they could not themselves typically afford;Student placements and recruitment;Fostered networking with other start-ups in the centres and more widely.E.I. has invested over €50m in these facilities that operate in nearly every Institute of Technology and university in the country.  They typically comprise a number of incubation units, some hot-desking space for prospective entrepreneurs as well as ancillary space, such as meeting rooms and networking areas.  There are currently 276 companies in the 21 facilities operational across Ireland, employing over 1,100 people and operating in a range of areas, including software, environmental technologies and digital media.EI has also rolled out four schemes to support communities to develop locally owned Community Enterprise Centres, (CECs) which have enabled entrepreneurs to establish, provide employment and to grow their businesses in their own locality, by providing a physical and human support network for emerging entrepreneurs and micro industry.  The CEC scheme was designed as a community led initiative in the form of a partnership between the local community and the State.  Its objective has been to enhance the development of an enterprise climate through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation in both urban and rural locations.Since the launch of this initiative €61.4 million has been approved for the development of CECs across the country and this capital investment has facilitated the development of 134 centres, of which 108 have been completed with the balance either under construction or just recently approved.  Of the completed centres, the most recent data (2009) shows that they currently house 901 companies providing employment for 4,870 people.Additionally, support is provided through EI for the part funding of Business Innovation Centres (BICs), which are regionally based support organisations for pre-start-up and start-up enterprises and innovative existing companies.  There are four BICs located in Dublin, Galway Cork and Waterford, all providing incubation space to assist fledgling businesses start, establish and then to move on, so that vacated space can be used for other new start-up businesses.  A key feature of space managed by the BICs, is that the start up company not only gets space, but often also gets free business advice and access to facilities such as meeting rooms with audio visual equipment and to shared services such as a receptionist/telephonist, shared photocopiers and printers.In line with the Government focus on job creation I will ensure that there is a continual focus on the provision of adequate incubation space.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am very concerned about the job losses that have been announced and of the impact that they have had on the workers concerned and their families as well as the communities affected.I understand that Vodafone Ireland, which is not an IDA or EI client, has announced this as a part of a review of its European operations and which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States.  I am advised, as part of this process, that the company has been in discussions with unions and its Irish Call Centre contract partner, Rigney Dolphin.  I am aware that Vodafone has decided that a portion of the existing contracted call centre operations in Dundalk and Dublin will be moved to other locations — Egypt and India — within the Vodafone Group and to other specialist contractors in Ireland.This decision will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin — the 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have been assured that Rigney Dolphin will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.I also understand that all impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered.  A consultation process is now underway with all Vodafone employees affected by the decision to finalise the alternatives available.  The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.My officials and Minister of State Sean Sherlock recently met with Vodafone.  The company explained that in the current market environment, cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  In particular, this includes being in a position to make major funding investments in Ireland that will be required in the future to compete in the market.  I have indicated that I am available to meet with the Communications Workers Union to discuss their concerns.Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The Deputy will be aware that the issue of restructuring the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) has been in the public domain since the publication of the McCarty Group Report in 2009 under the last Administration.The CEB model has served the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland well over the years but there is also no doubt that some restructuring of that model is now required.  There have been many changes to the social, economic and technological landscape of Ireland since the establishment of the Boards in 1993. I am of the view that it is timely and appropriate to re-structure, and re-focus, how the State delivers its support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector given that this Sector will be vital to job creation and to overall economic recovery in Ireland.Both I, and my officials, are currently seeking to determine the extent to which there should be restructuring of the County and City Enterprise Boards having regard to the Programme for Government, and to other recommendations on CEB restructuring, to the need to achieve a rational and focused model for entrepreneurs, as well as the need to ensure that there is targeted local delivery of enterprise support, driven by a national enterprise policy, in a manner which eliminates overlap and duplication.In relation to funding, an annual Exchequer allocation is provided each year for the operation of the CEBs. The Exchequer allocation is made in the context of the overall public finances and in 2011 amounts to €27.242m, of which €15m in Capital is available for direct grants and training, mentoring and advice services to micro-enterprise clients.  The bulk of the non-capital allocation to each CEB pays the salaries of the Business Advisers and other staff who provide direct advice and mentoring to client companies. This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate.The CEB Central Coordination Unit (within Enterprise Ireland) works closely with the CEBs throughout the year reviewing individual expenditures to ensure that the funding allocated to the CEBs is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds.  Some Boards may choose to commit all of their available funding as projects present themselves, even if this means that their funding is committed relatively early in the year, while others may choose to reserve some funding until later in the year so that they are in a position to support other high quality projects that emerge at that time.  Should it arise during the year that some Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocation, for example where an approved grant is decommitted late in the year if the project has not started, it is reallocated to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds within the year.There is undoubtedly a high level of demand on CEBs resources at present and the matter will continue to be monitored by the CEB Central Coordination Unit.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The principal role of all 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide support for the micro-enterprise sector in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The criteria under which financial assistance is available from the CEBs is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size, or proposed size, of the enterprise.  The enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people.All CEBs must give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and they must always consider any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from the provision of assistance to a proposed enterprise.The CEBs can offer both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial intervention, which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives etc.  Training courses can include such topics as start-your-own-business, taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills.Individual CEBs carry out their activities in accordance with standard Operating Agreements which are monitored by the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland ensuring a consistency across all CEBs.  Although all CEBs thus work off an identical set of eligibility criteria and an identical suite of financial interventions, there are certain differences between CEBs as to how they apply these interventions e.g. the individual level of a grant or the refundability level applying to a grant payment may vary.  I am of the view that it is appropriate and feasible to allow individual Boards a level of discretion and flexibility in the way in which they provide financial assistance, and deliver their "soft supports", so as to enable them to take account of the economic conditions and sectoral demands particular to their area of responsibility, the differences in requirements and emphasis and the overall budget available to them in any given year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	532	On 24 May last, the Government decided to publish the Report of the Independent Review of Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms.The Report's overall finding is that the basic framework of the current JLC/REA regulatory system requires radical overhaul so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.To coincide with the publication of the report, I immediately requested a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to hear that organisation's views on the Report and to outline my proposals to address the report's recommendations and other issues raised in the report.  That meeting took place on 1st June.  It afforded me an opportunity to hear the views of the Congress regarding the particular circumstances of workers in the sectors affected by the current regulatory framework and the practical issues affecting the implementation of reform in these wage-setting mechanisms.I also held discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, IBEC and other employer interests in the sectors covered by statutory wage fixing mechanisms.  In accordance with the terms of the EU/IMF programme, discussions have also taken place with representatives of the troika.These discussions afforded me the opportunity to hear at first hand the views of the main representative bodies of trade unions and employers on how a meaningful and overdue reform might be implemented in these wage-setting mechanisms, which affect key sectors of our economy, in order to protect existing jobs and encourage employment growth.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21289	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The overall finding of the Report of the Review of Employment Regulations Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms was that the basic framework of the current ERO/REA regulatory system requires radical overhaul so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.The Report does not recommend, nor have I proposed, specific adjustments in wage rates and other conditions of employment for employees covered by EROs/REAs.Workers are protected by contracts of employment and proposed reform of the wage setting mechanisms would not if implemented, change the terms of those individual contracts.  What is proposed would have the effect of changing how pay and conditions are set in order to make the operation of the machinery more flexible and prevent businesses being left behind by changing economic circumstances.  Existing employees would not have their current entitlement affected by future changes to EROs unless (a) it is already stipulated in their contract of employment that they be paid at the prevailing rate of pay and conditions set by the relevant ERO or (b) the application of alternative provisions to those specified in the ERO is agreed between the employer and the employee or the employee's representatives.The Government is determined to proceed with urgency to a substantial reform of the current JLC/REA regulatory system in order to protect existing jobs in these vulnerable sectors of the economy and to increase the likelihood of employment in these sectors being increased.  This will restore competitiveness in key sectors of the economy, including the hospitality sector which is crucial to our tourism product offering, and complement the restoration of the recent cut to the National Minimum Wage thereby providing an adequate floor for lower paid workers.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Section 46(7) of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides that for the purposes of receiving a notification of intention to marry, a registrar may require the parties to the intended marriage to provide him or her with such evidence relating to that party's forename, surname, address, marital status, age and nationality as may be specified by the Registrar General.  Following representations from foreign embassies relating to the high incidence of suspected marriages of convenience, the Registrar General issued revised guidelines to registrars including the requirement for a birth certificate originating outside the State to bear an apostille stamp, or be authenticated by the embassy or other relevant national authority.The 1961 Hague Convention provides that countries that are parties to the convention may request the bearer of the relevant document, in this case birth certificates, to obtain an apostille from the authorities that issued the document. An apostille involves the addition of a certificate, either stamped on the document itself or attached to it.  It certifies the country of origin of the document, the identity and capacity in which the document has been signed, and the name of any authority which has affixed a seal or stamp to the document.In implementing the policy, the Registrar General has received legal advice to the effect that it is not permissible to discriminate as between persons born in another jurisdiction, either by exempting or targeting persons born in specific countries.  The Registrar General is also advised that the birth records of persons born in the State must be checked.  There is no requirement for the latter records to be authenticated by another authority, as the registrar taking notice of intention to marry is in a position to do this.Marriages of convenience are a very serious matter, as they often involve trafficking of vulnerable women in certain EU countries, and associated criminality.  Feedback from foreign embassies is to the effect that the measure is effective, as it requires the person concerned to contact their embassy or other national authority to obtain authentication of the birth certificate.  In such circumstances, the embassy or national authority may provide advice and counselling to the person and/or refer them to appropriate social services.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	537	My understanding is that the Deputy is referring to a service that was previously part funded under the Community Services Programme and which had grant support withdrawn due to audit findings that were not adequately addressed by the board members of the Company holding the contract.  Given the situation, the Deputy will appreciate that service providers that do not meet the standards set for the management and application of public funds will not be approved for further support.  I have no proposal for the re-establishment of the services in this part of County Kerry.  Should a proposal be advanced, my Department will consider it against the criteria set out for the Community Services Programme and the context of the available funds.  The Deputy will wish to note that the Community Services Programme operates on a community business and social enterprise model that requires service providers to generate a significant level of the resources required for the delivery and development of the services proposed from non-public sources.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	538	As Minister for Social Protection I do not have a role in the administration of individual cases in regard to the operation of the Community Employment (CE) programme.  The administration of individual cases under CE is a day-to-day matter for FÁS as part of its responsibility under the Labour Services Act, 1987, as amended by Part 3 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.Extensions of a CE placement have to be requested a minimum of eight weeks before the participant's proposed finish date by the CE Project Supervisor.  Once an extension application is received by the local FÁS office, the FÁS Development Officer decides whether the extra year's placement is the most suitable and cost effective measure to assist the client in gaining employment.  Clients who are deemed job-ready by the Supervisor are not extended in order to free up the place for another client.  If no request for an extension is requested then the person must leave the scheme and re-qualify under the published eligibility rules for any further participation on the CE scheme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	539	The back to education allowance (BTEA) is one of a range of activation supports and policies with the objective of assisting social welfare recipients to improve their life chances by facilitating access to employment, work experience, education and training.  The focus of the back to education allowance scheme is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment such as jobseekers' benefit for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications.For BTEA purposes the course being pursued, including ‘farm courses' must be full-time and must lead to a qualification that is:recognised by the Department of Education and Skills or,has Further Education and Training Awards Council recognition (FETAC) or,has Higher Education and Training Awards Council recognition(HETAC).BTEA is paid at the maximum personal rate of the social welfare payment that qualifies the person and in addition an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.Participants of part-time courses may qualify for the part-time education option (PTEO) available under the jobseeker schemes.  The PTEO enables unemployed persons to attend part-time courses of education or training and retain their jobseekers allowance or jobseekers benefit provided they continue to satisfy the conditions of the jobseeker scheme, including being available for and genuinely seeking employment.Under the PTEO, payment continues for the duration of the jobseeker's claim.  A person on jobseeker's benefit who exhausts his/her benefit will have to apply for jobseekers allowance in the normal way.  Jobseekers allowance is subject to a means test. Participation under the PTEO does not confer any additional or extended entitlement to a social welfare payment nor are any additional allowances paid in conjunction with it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 262 together.The jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative employment.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.  In general, persons attending full-time residential programmes will not satisfy these criteria.However, legislative provisions provide that a person is deemed to be available for work on any day in respect of which s/he is participating in a course of rehabilitation training provided by an organisation approved by the Minister for Health and Children for that purpose.In this context, further information is required regarding the particular circumstances of the cases being raised.  In this regard, officials will be in contact with both Deputies to establish the precise details involved so that a full reply may issue as soon as possible.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 240, inclusive, together.A claim by the person concerned for Jobseeker's Allowance was made to the Department on 27 April 2011 and was disallowed on the grounds that he was not habitually resident and that he had not shown he was available for or genuinely seeking work.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal from the person concerned was registered on 13 May and was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in the case.There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but he will be informed when arrangements have been made.The person concerned originally applied for jobseeker's allowance on 6 October 2009.  This claim was disallowed by a Deciding Officer on the grounds that he was not habitually resident in the state, having only arrived in the State on 2/10/09.  This decision was upheld by an Appeals Officer on a summary basis on 18 August 2010.  The case was re-opened for review by way of an oral hearing which was heard in March 2011.  While this claim was pending the person concerned claimed and was paid Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  The anonymous report referred to by the Deputy was made to the control section of the Department in Carrick-on-Shannon on 18/8/10 and forwarded to HSE West in connection with that claim.On foot of this report, his claim to Supplementary Welfare Allowance was reviewed and the outcome was that it was disallowed on the basis the person did not satisfy the habitual residence condition. This decision was also appealed to the SWAO and both this appeal and the re-opened Jobseeker's Allowance appeal were heard together in March 2011.  The allegations made in the anonymous report were on the file forwarded to the appeals office in connection with the Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeal.  On this basis, the Appeals Officer who heard the case orally in March 2011 raised the report with the appellant and afforded him the opportunity to comment on it.  The allegations were refuted by the person concerned.Having considered the overall circumstances and taking into consideration all the evidence presented at the oral hearing, the Appeals Officer was not satisfied that the appellant could be considered to have a settled, permanent or habitual residence in the State.

In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the overall average waiting time for an appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 27.4 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 45.6 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.In an effort to reduce these processing times, the Department has made nine additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.  These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to a 3 further full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.The Social Welfare Appeals Office and the Department engage with each other on an ongoing basis with a view to improving decision making by Deciding Officers and also with a view to improving the time taken to respond to appeals.  This is achieved through meetings with various areas of the Department, including, in particular the Decisions Advisory Office which is tasked with ensuring that decisions are consistent and of good quality.While 12,029 (47%) appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant in 2010, almost two thirds of these decisions (7,282) were in fact revised decisions made by Deciding Officers, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by claimants after the original decision on their claim.  In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary.  In addition, it should be noted that of the 17,499 appeals decided by Appeals Officers, a total of 12,752 (73%) upheld the original decision of the Deciding Officer.

The scheme is administered from the Department's Longford office.The current weekly personal rate of invalidity pension for customers aged 65 and under is €193.50. This rate increases to €230.30 per week when a customer reaches 65.  A person may also qualify for a living alone allowance which is paid at a weekly rate of €7.70. A weekly allowance of €12.70 is payable to recipients living on a specified island. These rates are in line with budget changes which came into effect from 06 January 2011. A recipient of invalidity pension is entitled to avail of the free travel scheme which is administered from the Department's Sligo office.A person in receipt of an invalidity pension may be eligible for further income supports such as the free fuel allowance or the household benefits package if he/she satisfies the qualifying criteria. Invalidity pension in itself does not confer entitlement to these additional supports.The Department's scheme expenditure on invalidity pension in 2010 was €640 million approx. The free travel scheme was provided at an annual cost of €74 million in 2010.   8,774 new invalidity pension claims were registered in 2010.  At 31/12/2010 there were 50,766 invalidity pension recipients.  The direct costs of administering the invalidity pension scheme in 2010 were € 2.06 million approx.  This equates to a cost of € 40 per annum per client and represents a 0.3% of total scheme expenditure. All expenditure figures quoted are provisional and do not include the cost of shared services, central support services, agency services (e.g. An Post/Bank Charges) etc. which are not reported or analysed at scheme level at present.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The effective date for standardisation of State pension age is 1 January 2014.  Therefore, the person in the scenario outlined by the Deputy would not receive State pension (transition) as he or she would reach age of 65 on 3 February 2014.  Should an individual not be able to remain in employment past the age of 65, he or she would be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment for the period between the cessation of employment and the State pension age of 66.The background to the changes in State pension age is that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  Life expectancy is increasing.  The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050, from 11% to 26%.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by mid-century.   Spending on public pensions, that is, social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5 % of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% by 2050.Therefore, as provided for in the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  The legislative changes being included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 also fulfil one of the commitments in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.

This disqualification also extends to the holiday periods, including the summer holidays.  The disqualification for receipt of jobseeker's benefit or allowance does not apply in the case of mature students during the period between two academic years. During this period a mature student can apply for jobseeker's benefit or allowance, subject to satisfying the standard qualifying conditions, including that of being available for full-time work.  Any changes to these conditions would be for Government to consider in a budgetary context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	569	One of the functions of my Department is to provide income support for the unemployed.  This is provided through the payment of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance to those who have an entitlement.  Jobseeker's benefit is payable to a person who has the necessary amount of paid eligible PRSI contributions for an entitlement to exist.  Jobseeker's allowance is a means-tested payment and in assessing a person's means for the purposes of this allowance, account is taken of all income including a spouse's earnings.As well as providing income maintenance my Department also has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.  A range of employment support programmes is available to eligible people which assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients to return to the active labour market through encouraging participation in education, taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  Given the range of people supported the requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of employment support schemes and this is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.FÁS, as the National Training Authority, anticipates the needs of, and responds to, a constantly changing labour market.  It strives to do this through the provision of tailored training programmes that suit everyone's needs and access to many training programmes is not determined by a person's welfare status.  Through a regional network of 66 offices and 20 training centres, FÁS operates these training programmes including some in co-operation with community, voluntary and statutory organisations.  Further information is available locally at these FÁS offices.

These payments are an income support for the carers while they are engaged in caring duties. They are not intended to cover the cost of the individual care needs of the person being cared for. In the majority of cases this person will be in receipt of a social welfare payment in his/her own right (e.g. State pension or disability allowance) and the additional supports required are available from the Health Services Executive. This may include assistance with transport costs in certain circumstances.The Revenue Commissioners' disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme provides a range of tax reliefs for the purchase and use of vehicles by disabled drivers and disabled passengers. A family member of the disabled person can qualify for relief if he or she is living with and responsible for the transport of the disabled person in question and has acquired a vehicle for that purpose.My Department also provides free travel to people aged 66 years or over, carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.

In April, the Government established a compensation scheme for affected turf-cutters which would provide them with an annual financial payment for a period of fifteen years or with the opportunity to relocate to alternative non-designated bog, where feasible. 3,500 people with an interest in the 31 sites were written to and ads were published in local newspapers and on radio to remind people that further cutting on these sites was not lawful.  In addition, the Peatlands Council was established to allow representative groups of those affected by the cessation, conservation interests and relevant State bodies to work through the measures necessary to meet Ireland's commitments in regard to these sites.Officials from my Department have been engaged in regular monitoring of these sites which has been carried out with both ground patrols and aerial surveillance.From this ongoing monitoring I was made aware that turf-cutting had taken place on a small number of these 31 sites and my officials responded by undertaking intensive enforcement action in those bogs, where people found engaged in turf-cutting or harvesting activity were spoken to and cautioned, where necessary. I brought this fact to the attention of my Government colleagues and on 24 May I issued a press statement that day reminding people of the legal situation regarding unlawful turf-extraction in these sites.The following week, on 1 June, the Peatlands Council held a meeting where the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association and the Irish Farmers Association gave firm undertakings that their members would not undertake any further turf-cutting in these sites.

Separately, provision has been made in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to apply these requirements to plans and projects covered by the planning code. These provisions will apply equally to plans and projects within and outside European sites. The provision of the 1997-2005 Regulations that equates Environmental Impact Assessment and appropriate assessment will be replaced by provisions that make a clear distinction between these separate assessment processes.In addition, the regulations will provide me, as Minister, with the power to regulate, inside and outside European sites, activities that I consider likely to harm European sites or to damage the wider habitats of flora and fauna, including birds.In late 2010, the draft regulations were the subject of extensive public consultation, and the draft has been refined on foot of those consultations.

The effect of the preservation order is that it is unlawful for any person to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter or in any manner injure or interfere with the national monument without the consent of the Minister  for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is also unlawful for any person to excavate, dig, plough or otherwise disturb the ground within, around or in proximity to the national monument without the Minister's consent.In recent times my Department has been focusing on meeting obligations under the Habitats and Birds Directives by designating an appropriate number and type of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs).  The State's progress in this area has been the subject of adverse findings by the European Court of Justice and my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service must address these designations as a first priority.Following completion of the designations of SACs and SPAs, my Department will consider the designation of sites proposed as Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs).  These proposed sites are relatively small in area and are spread throughout the country.Many proposed NHAs have already been subsumed within the boundaries of SACs and SPAs and are afforded protection under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations.  Most are also afforded some measure of protection through the planning system arising from their inclusion in Local Authority County Development Plans as Nature Conservation Sites.

The scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty.  Over 20,000 low-income homes are to benefit from energy efficiency retrofit measures in 2011.The success of the scheme in 2010 has led to increased awareness and demand.  It is the case therefore that there has been an increase in waiting times.  This has resulted in SEAI having to prioritise certain lower cost measures in homes in order to secure and address the maximum number of vulnerable homes this year.  SEAI is currently working with community based organisations (CBOs) and private contractors to prioritise delivery in the coming months to those homes which have been waiting for the longest period.A dedicated hot line for the WHS is managed by the SEAI (WHS hot line — 1800 250 204), and it is SEAI's objective to ensure that eligibility on available measures are dealt with immediately.

In view of their staffing resource constraints, IFI are employing new technologies and utilising the public's cooperation through the new poaching hotline (1890 347424) to assist in the detection of illegal activities.  This is complemented by ensuring the maximum visible presence in waters where the threat of illegal activity is greatest, timely prosecution of offenders and confiscation of illegal nets etc.  There has been an increase of nearly 40% in the number of prosecutions initiated since 2007.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 to 313, inclusive, together.As the Deputy is aware, the primary motivation in aligning the management of the wild salmon fishery with the scientific advice to cease mixed stock fishing at sea, is the conservation of the wild salmon stocks.  It is vital to afford every protection to the at-risk salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  Ireland must fulfil its obligations under the Habitats Directive, namely to maintain or restore fish stocks, protected by the Directive, to favourable conservation status.I am advised that there can be no question of relaxing the conservation measures other than in rivers where stocks are meeting conservation limits and where it is established that significant numbers of fish destined for other rivers are not intercepted. It is not envisaged, for these reasons due to the constraints of the Habitats Directive that drift netting in the open seas will be licensed in the future.I am conscious of the impact of the cessation of the seasonal wild salmon fishery on island communities.  This was addressed, I understand, in the allocation of €5 million which was provided for a Community Support Scheme, the focus of which was primarily on those communities where commercial salmon fishing was a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacted on the economic and social fabric of the area.My Department does not hold any details in relation to the number of island-based fishermen who did not avail of the salmon hardship scheme.

This means that any service provider can use the network without having to privately invest and replicate network footprints throughout the country.It should be noted that before a backhaul solution is put in place in any MAN town, there needs to be demand for MAN based services.  This would typically be a business which incurs telecoms charges in excess of €1,000.In the case of the Carndonagh MAN, e|net has been exploring various backhaul options with operators in the area.  In the event that business premises in Carndonagh require broadband services delivered over a fibre connection, e|net would set out the possible options and costs.

This funding contract was fully honoured by Government, and extended until the end of June 2011. Organisations participating in the scheme were aware that funding beyond the contractually agreed timeframe could not be guaranteed and that the scheme was subject to review.A comprehensive review of the scheme was carried out in 2010 and a new scheme, with amended criteria, was advertised in December 2010. 149 applications were received and 63 organisations were approved for funding, of which 46 had been funded under the previous 2008-2010 scheme.Funding under the new 2011-2013 scheme has been allocated following an objective and merit-based competitive process. The application from the CWC did not meet the qualifying mark for funding on this occasion. The CWC has appealed the funding decision and the appeals process is ongoing.

My Department now has responsibility for the CLÁR Programme.The funding committed to this project at the time was on the basis of 12.5% from the CLÁR Programme, 75% from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food and 12.5% from Kerry County Council. I understand that the amount due through CLÁR, €150,000 was fully drawn down by the County Council in 2008, and it was based on the overall project cost of €1.2 million notified at the time. Accordingly, there is no further commitment due in respect of this project.  No funding applications have been accepted since August 2008 under the main CLÁR Programme measures.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	619	Section 213 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010 provides for the acquisition of land by local authorities.  Further enhancements to the compulsory purchase process were introduced by way of the Compulsory Purchase Orders (Extension of Time Limits) Act 2010.  This improved the process whereby local authorities can obtain compulsory purchase orders, by providing that the statutory time limit for serving Notices to Treat on landowners relating to confirmed Compulsory Purchase Orders can be extended where legal proceedings are underway.The Act introduced efficiencies and ensures that the cost to local authorities of repeating the CPO process is avoided in the event that the outcome of the legal proceedings allows the project to proceed.I am satisfied that local authorities have sufficient compulsory purchase powers under the Planning Acts and I have no plans to amend the legislation at this time.

A case was brought to the LRC and was referred on to the Labour Court regarding the retirement age of retained firefighters.  That case is currently adjourned.  A review of the retirement age for retained firefighters was carried out in 2003. The normal retirement age for retained firefighters is 55 years of age. However, there is an option to continue working up to age 58, provided the firefighter passes an annual occupational health test.There are no proposals with my Department at present to amend these arrangements.

This provision was included in order to encourage take-up on the scheme.Other specific exemptions are contained in the Act for the provision of long term accommodation by the State, Local Authority and Voluntary and Co-operative providers.  These exemptions do not include landlords who provide rental accommodation to tenants who may be in receipt of rent allowance.

The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on the owner to assess his or her liability in the first instance and there is no obligation on local authorities to issue invoices or demands.I understand, however, that e-mail and postal reminder notifications have been issued to those who paid the charge last year in respect of their possible liability for 2011.

The following Table, which provides details of these cases, excludes 4 cases responsibility for which has recently transferred to my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.The Government is giving the highest priority to the transposition and implementation of EU environmental legislation.  Efforts are being intensified to bring Ireland into full compliance with EU legislation and to resolving outstanding ECJ infringement cases as quickly as possible.  Since my coming into office, my Department has already secured the closure of 4 cases and we will be continuing to put in place the necessary measures to close outstanding cases, some of which are complex in nature and will involve a variety of initiatives, including, for example, the proposed licensing of septic tanks.I have met the EU Environment Commissioner, Janez Potocnik, on a number of occasions, most recently at the Environment Council on 21 June to reassure him that every effort is being made to address the Commission's concerns on outstanding cases.This will continue to be a key priority for my Department in the lead up to the Irish Presidency in 2013.Article 258  Letter of Formal NoticeArticle 258 Reasoned OpinionBeing Referred to the European Court of JusticeBefore the European Court of Justice for a hearing or awaiting judgementEuropean Court of Justice Decision to be ImplementedArticle 260  Letter of Formal NoticeArticle 260 Second Letter of Formal NoticeECJ request for fines75/442/EEC the waste directive00000011280/68/EEC on groundwater00000100185/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment00001011391/271/EEC on urban waste water treatment00001000196/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control0010000012000/60 Water Framework Directive1000000012002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment0100000012001/42/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment0100000012008/56/EC establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy0100000012009/30/EC Fuel Quality1000000012010/26/EC Emissions from non road mobile machinery100000001TOTAL NUMBER AT EACH STAGE3310212214

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The objective is to install water meters in households and move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance.  My Department is currently preparing a strategy to implement these proposals.  Further details will be announced following the Government's consideration of the proposals.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The provision of a fire service, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable is a statutory function of fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.My Department has not undertaken a recent review of the fire services per se, but my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has set out a national blueprint and programme for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Fire Services.  This is contained in the recently agreed Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015 , which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  The Framework sets out policies and key actions in the areas of Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and Legislative Support.In addition, in common with other capital programmes, my Department has reviewed its fire services capital programme in order to prioritise projects seeking capital investment. I have recently approved a new programme of joint procurement of fire appliances and  expect this collaborative approach will deliver budgetary and administrative savings. Value for money is a key theme in the current climate and future developments will have to be brought to fruition within tighter resource constraints.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Fire services are provided by the 37 statutorily designated fire authorities, and are accordingly structured around the principal local authorities.  The 2002 Farrell Grant Sparks review of fire services in Ireland concluded unambiguously that this is an appropriate approach which should be strengthened.The review's recommendations in relation to national oversight, co-ordination and leadership were dealt with conclusively through the establishment of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management within my Department in 2009.  The Directorate has taken over the functions of the Fire Services Council and is an approach in keeping with the drive to reduce new agencies while providing appropriate political accountability.  The Directorate is not a national fire service, and fire authorities continue to deliver this service under the aegis of the local government system.Given that the Directorate is working well and meeting its mandate, I have no plans to establish a National Fire Authority or conduct a new study of fire services in Ireland.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Under section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 a fire authority is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including in particular, responsibility to make adequate provision for the reception of and response to calls for the assistance of the fire brigade.Fire authorities have successfully worked together with my Department on a shared services initiative to develop a computer- based system to handle emergency calls for the fire service. Under the system known as CAMP (Computer Aided Mobilisation Project), all emergency calls for the fire service are channelled to one of three control centres at Dublin, Castlebar and Limerick and the appropriate fire brigade response is activated from the relevant centre. In addition to dispatching fire service resources, where appropriate, the CAMP control centre will also notify other emergency services e.g. An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive or the Irish Coast Guard. Similarly, other emergency services control centres may direct 999/112 calls to the CAMP system.The response to emergency calls is based on an initial pre determined attendance (PDA) for the particular incident type at the address given. The PDA is the initial automatic turnout, but can be varied by the officer in charge. The PDAs are set down by the chief fire officer for each fire authority. As part of the CAMP project, PDAs were agreed on a regional basis for the generic incident types by the technical groups and approved by the Regional Management Groups.The three regional control centres operate to the highest international quality standards. The CAMP project was an early example of the shared services agenda delivering quality public services in a co-ordinated manner.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland under its fiscal consolidation measures commits to the introduction of a property tax for 2012 and to an increase in the property tax for 2013. The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the revenue measure in the EU/IMF Programme, I have already indicated my intention to introduce a household charge in 2012.I will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future on the legislative and administrative requirements necessary to implement the household charge, including consideration of payment methods.

In relation to the use of our own cars on official business, we may claim for official mileage up to a maximum of 96,540 kilometres per annum.  I can claim 59.07 cent per kilometre for the first 6,437 kilometres in respect of a car with an engine capacity between 1,501 and 2,000cc, and 28.46 cent per kilometre for 6,438 to 96,540 kilometres in any one year.  In the case of Minister of State Penrose, he is entitled to claim 70.89 cent and 34.15 cent respectively in respect of a car with an engine capacity of 2,001cc and over.In relation to subsistence, on official overnight business away from home or the Department's HQ, both Minister of State Penrose and myself are entitled to claim the vouched cost of a hotel room, including tax and up to 15% service charge.  We are also entitled to claim an overnight subsistence allowance of €72.66, i.e. half the civil service Class A overnight rate of €108.99 prescribed by the Department of Finance, increased by one-third.Where appropriate, we may also claim for 5 or 10 hours absences from home or headquarters as part of the foregoing subsistence arrangements, at the civil service Class A rates of €13.71 and €33.61 respectively.  When travelling abroad, including Northern Ireland, we may claim for the vouched cost of a hotel room as set out above, plus the civil service Class A conference rate for the location increased by one third, with the exception of the USA and Canada, where it is increased by a half.Minister of State O'Dowd does not claim travel and subsistence expenses from my Department.

I am pleased with the progress to date under the Programme in the Galway area. Notwithstanding the difficulties presented in the current economic climate the programme continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times.

The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority. Work on the independent assessment has commenced and the assessment is due for completion by the end of October 2011. The Government will then consider proposals for the establishment of Irish Water.The independent assessment will examine the proposed role and functions of Irish Water, the approach to assigning these functions to the authority from the 34 local authorities, and the optimal organisational structure for the company including the indicative staffing complement.

In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is working with local authorities in developing options for the enhancement of these arrangements which will further assist citizens in availing of local authority services and in reporting problems or faults to their local authority.  I expect to receive proposals in this regard shortly.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	639	Under Government Accounting procedures, disbursements on dormant accounts measures are paid in the first instance "up front" from my Department's Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme.  The Dormant Accounts budget for my Department for 2011 is fully committed to existing projects, and my priority must be to ensure that legal contractual commitments are met.The position with dormant accounts expenditure compared with other funding programmes is that once spending takes place, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in accordance with the Dormant Accounts Acts, in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid payable through the Department's Vote. In this way, the costs associated with dormant accounts measures are Exchequer "neutral".  Monies disbursed from the Fund increase Government debt levels as the money belongs to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.Six capital projects have been prioritised by Pobal under the RAPID Additionality Measure for Mullingar. The matter of progressing the RAPID Additionality measure to contract stage will be kept under active review in the light of availability of funding / levels of expenditure across the Department's Vote during 2011 and, if necessary, into 2012. In the event that a portion of the funding becomes available this year, it is proposed that it be made available to projects in an equitable way on the basis of priority, subject to recommendations from Pobal under agreed criteria.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	640	My Department provides annual block grant allocations to local authorities under its Rural Water Programme, which includes group water schemes.  Under the programme, grants of 100% of the costs of certain works on group water schemes are covered by my Department while grants of up to 85% of the costs, subject to a maximum grant of €6,475.66 per house or €7,475.66 per house as the case may be, are available for other works on such schemes.Responsibility for the administration of the programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. Details of the particular grant that may apply in any particular case may, therefore, be sought from the local authorities. In addition, the selection and approval of individual schemes for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocations provided, is a matter for the local authorities.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The issue of potential health effects of electromagnetic fields was the subject of an Expert Group Report published by Government in March 2007 entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields. This report is available for download on my Department's website (www.environ.ie/en/publications).The Expert Group examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including the issue of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields. The Report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.The Report advised that majority scientific opinion to date was that a causal link between the symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity and exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has not been demonstrated. However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO).The Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone masts, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no causal link between symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity and exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) which are in force here. This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the licensing authority for the telecommunications industry, commissions audit reports to verify that its licensed operators are in compliance with their licence conditions relating to emission limits for non-ionising radiation. The detailed measurement results from over 700 transmitter sites surveyed to date have so far shown total compliance. Recorded levels of radio frequency signals are typically measured as being within the range of 0.002% to 2% of the safe exposure levels set by the ICNIRP guidelines. This is lower or comparable to radio frequency exposures from radio and television broadcasts. The location of licensed telecommunications antennae and the results of individual site survey reports can be found on ComReg's website: http://www.askcomreg.ie/mobile/siteviewer.273.LE.asp.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that, on application, the duration of a planning permission (normally 5 years) shall be extended, subject to certain requirements being complied with, including that substantial works have been carried out before the expiration of the original permission.Section 28 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 amended Section 42 of the 2000 Act to provide additional grounds for extension of the duration of planning permission.  The amended section 42 provides that planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been undertaken, or where the development has not commenced, in cases where a planning authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission.This latter provision is subject to the following qualifications—that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the regional planning guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28 of the Act, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section, andthat the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.I consider that these provisions offer satisfactory mechanisms to address the issue and I have no plans to introduce further measures.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.The term of office of the current President expires on 10 November 2011. Article 12.3.3 of the Constitution provides that an election for the office of President shall be held in the 60 day period before the expiry of the term of office of the President. This gives a period commencing on 11 September 2011 and ending on 10 November 2011. No decision has been made on the date of the election.Article 12.4.2 of the Constitution provides for the participation by County and City Councils in the nomination process for Presidential candidates. A candidate in the Presidential election needs to be nominated by not less than 20 members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or by not less than four City or County Councils. The nomination process is a reserved function of the Councils and is regulated by law under section 16 of the Presidential Elections Act 1993. The main points arising are as follows:Councils may, by resolution, resolve to nominate one candidate,Not less than 3 clear days notice of the intention to propose the resolution must be given in writing to every person, who, at the time when the notice is given, is a member of the Council,A resolution under section 16 of the Act cannot be passed before the making of the Presidential Election Order — this Order, which is made under section 6 of the Act, sets out the last day on which the Presidential Returning Officer may receive nominations, the date and time of the poll at the election and other details, andThe resolution of the Council must be given effect by means of a nomination paper, as prescribed in the Presidential Elections (Forms) Regulations 2011, sealed with the seal of the Council and delivered to the Presidential Returning Officer.To assist Councils in this matter, a circular, detailing the process and the legislative provisions, was sent by my Department to each City and County Manager on 10 May 2011. At this early stage, no Presidential Election Order has been made and no Presidential Returning Officer has been appointed.

The Government recently approved the urgent drafting of a Bill to provide for the establishment of a new system for the inspection and monitoring of the performance of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.  The Bill will be published as soon as possible and my intention will be to pursue its early enactment thereafter.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.  Accordingly, the question of whether the voluntary fire service referred to in the question should continue to operate is a matter for the relevant fire authority.County, city and borough councils are designated fire authorities under the legislation.  Outside the main cities which employ full-time fire fighters, fire services are provided by a retained staffing system.  Retained fire-fighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a full professional fire service for their communities.  They are trained, equipped, supervised and operate to the same procedures as their full-time colleagues.  Volunteer fire units operate in a relatively small number of areas, but outside the direct control of the fire authority.The volunteer unit in question does not have the requisite training to attend certain types of incidents.  While it has received some training, equipment and funding from the Council in the past, it does not report to and is not under the control of the Council's Fire Section.As part of my Department's role in supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services, including the setting of national policy and the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme, a programme for the preparation and dissemination of Standard Operating Guidelines (SOGs) covering all aspects of operational activity is in train.  These are intended to assist fire authorities to meet their statutory duties, with due cognisance to compliance with health and safety.

Resource levels are constantly monitored, in conjunction with crime trends and the situation is kept under continuing review to ensure optimum use is made of all resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána on 31 May 2011, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 14,262.Multi-disciplinary approaches are utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in all criminal enterprises are effectively targeted, including the use of the Proceeds of Crime, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, together with the Criminal Assets Bureau, whose powers I plan to strengthen in relation to forfeiting the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking and dealing.  Members of An Garda Síochána utilise all available legislation, including the additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 which amended the Criminal Justice Act 2006 relating to organised crime.  This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in relation to policing matters which the Government fully intend to implement.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I refer to my earlier reply to Parliamentary Question No. 477 of 3 May 2011 and I regret the delay in replying.I have since been advised by the Garda Authorities that where a decision is taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute a particular case, the investigation file remains open and all of the evidence gathered during the course of the investigation is retained.  The statute of limitations does not apply to criminal cases and there is no specified time period for the retention or destruction of crime investigation files.Having said that, however, the Garda Síochána is a scheduled body within the meaning of section 1 of the National Archives Act 1986 and is, therefore, legally obliged to retain and preserve ‘Departmental Records' made in the course of its business, including crime investigation files, in accordance with the provisions of that Act.  As against that, the Garda Síochána, as a Data Controller pursuant to the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, has a responsibility to ensure that personal data is retained for no longer than is necessary for the purpose or purposes for which it was obtained.  To meet these, in some respects counter-balancing obligations, the Garda Síochána is required to be clear about the reason why information is being retained and the length of time the data is to be kept.  This requires the Garda Síochána to ensure that files are regularly reviewed so that personal data is not retained any longer than is necessary.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The position is as I have stated in my detailed response to the Deputy on 7 June 2011.  The time-line for publication of the proposals is Quarter 3 of 2011.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I am informed by the Garda authorities that a vetting application was received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit in respect of the person to whom the Deputy refers.  The application has been processed and a response was returned to the registered organisation involved.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	661	As the Deputy will be aware, there is excellent police-to-police co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, particularly in the ongoing fight against paramilitary groups and organised crime.  The relationship between the two police forces has never been closer and is being brought forward in the context of the recently launched Cross Border Policing Strategy.  This co-operation includes, on occasion, members of the Garda Síochána accompanying PSNI officers in Northern Ireland and PSNI officers accompanying members of An Garda Síochána in this jurisdiction.  However, neither An Garda Síochána nor the PSNI exercise police powers in such cases while in the other's jurisdiction.  In their applications to participate in the Schengen Agreement, neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom will be opting in at this time to Article 41, which provides for hot pursuit across international borders.  In order to be effective, it will be necessary for both member states to opt in at the same time.  However, I repeat that An Garda Síochána and the PSNI already maintain very close co-operation and contact in real-time operational scenarios.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	662	Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park Agreement), An Garda Síochána is committed to the replacement of paper payslips by providing members with electronic access to this information by December 2011.  My Department is currently examining the technicalities involved.  It is necessary to determine the most effective and efficient implementation approach, taking into account that the working environment of members of An Garda Síochána differs considerably from most other public servants who have ready access to computers and printers at their desks.  The total cost of providing paper payslips amounted to €410,487 in 2010 and €203,131 for the year to date.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I draw the Deputy's attention to Section 9 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 and to the Maternity Protection (Protection of Mothers who are Breast-feeding) Regulations 2004.  Under these provisions, all women in employment who have given birth within the previous six months and who are breast-feeding are entitled to take time off work each day in order to breastfeed.  I should explain that employers are not obliged to provide facilities in the workplace to facilitate breast-feeding if the provision of such facilities would give rise to considerable costs.  At the choice of her employer, the employee may therefore opt to breast-feed in the workplace or express breast milk, where facilities are provided in the workplace by the employer; or have her working hours reduced (without loss of pay) to facilitate breast-feeding where facilities are not made available.  While there are no plans at present to extend the statutory entitlement beyond six months, my Department will keep the matter under review as part of an overall review of maternity protection and family leaves in the light of developing European Union law in this area.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	664	It is the function of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) to carry out Government policy in accommodating asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of today, RIA has 46 centres across 19 counties, accommodating 5,800 residents.  The system is constantly evolving, taking account of the ebb and flow of residents and the financial resources available to RIA.  At the end of February 2011, the numbers needing to be accommodated by RIA (i.e. occupancy) had declined by almost 7% over the previous 12 months and this trend is continuing downwards.  Taking the period specified in the question, the reduction in the cost of the direct provision system achieved in the first two months of 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, arises from two principal factors: first, a reduction in bed spaces and second, direct cost cutting measures involving, in some cases, a reduction in the per diem rates arising from new contract negotiations and savings on utility costs in the State owned centres.  To illustrate the former factor, the number of bed spaces being provided in the direct provision system (i.e. capacity) at the end of February 2010 was 7,689 and this was reduced to 7,015 a year later — a difference of 674, or almost 9%.  If one assumes there is a continuing reduction in the number needing to be accommodated and the efforts to drive down costs proceed apace, there is every reason for one to conclude the cost of the system will continue to decline and the savings achieved so far this year will not be one-off.  This will be part of a continuing decline in cost of the direct provision system in recent years, as illustrated by the following table:YearCost (Outturn)2008€91 million2009€86 million2010€79 million2011€67.5 million (estimate)

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.

The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The jury system is also being examined.In the meantime, I am providing for some early reform of the coroner system in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 that was presented to the Seanad last week. Part 9 of that Bill provides for amalgamation of districts in Dublin and for certain other matters in relation to the filling of a vacancy of the office of coroner or deputy coroner.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 380 together.Section 84(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005  provides for a period of six months, beginning on the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint, for a person to make a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  Section 84(2) of that Act provides for an extension to the six month deadline if the Ombudsman Commission considers that there are good reasons for doing so.In my opinion the six month deadline, together with the discretion afforded to the Ombudsman Commission to extend the time in particular cases where it is of the view that there is good reason to do so, strikes the right balance and provides a system that is fair and equitable to both members of the public who wish to make a complaint, and members of the Garda Síochána who will have to defend themselves in the face of such complaint and I do not propose to bring amending legislation to alter this statutory position.The number and percentage of cases that have been found to be inadmissible by the Ombudsman Commission, by reason of time delay, are set out in the table below.  It should be noted that an individual complaint may contain several allegations.  In  2007, the Ombudsman Commission's first year of operations, the benefit of recording both the number of complaints and the number of allegations separately became clear and its recording mechanisms were subsequently refined.  A full and detailed breakdown of both complaints and allegations deemed inadmissible by reason of being out of time is, therefore, not available for the years 2007 and 2008.YearC: ComplaintsA: Allegations% and Number of complaints / allegations received and deemed inadmissible as “out of time”2007C- 2084C- 6%  1252008A- 4227A- 8%   3382009C- 2097A- 3509C- 9%  188A- 8%   2802010C- 2258A- 4931C- 7%  158A- 5%   248
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	671	Allegations of this nature were previously the subject of an investigation which resulted in an Investigation File being submitted to the Law Officers in 2009. The findings of the Law Officers at that time were that no evidence was found of any impropriety, interference or improper advances by either serving or former members of An Garda Síochána.The general position is that when a Garda member leaves An Garda Síochána their access to Garda Information systems is disabled and there is no mechanism whereby they can access these information systems.   Serving and former members of the Force are subject to the prohibition on the disclosure of information contained in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  Section 62 of that Act was enacted for the purpose of specifically prohibiting a person who is or was a member of the Garda Síochána, or of its civilian staff, from disclosing information obtained in the course of his or her duties.  The section provides stiff penalties, fines up to €75,000 and/or up to 7 years imprisonment for conviction on indictment, for persons who contravene its provisions and receive any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement to disclose any information.The Garda Síochána takes its responsibilities in relation to information in its possession very seriously and any allegation of misuse will be investigated.  If the Deputy has more recent and specific information alleging unauthorised disclosure of Garda data it should be provided to the Garda authorities so that it can be investigated in the proper way.

However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful.The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.I shouldremind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Judges of these courts sit during term and are also available, as required, for sitting out of hours and during vacation periods.  Judges  of the High and Supreme Court also use vacation time for writing judgments.Under the provisions of section 164 of the Finance Act 1994, an annual expense allowance is payable to members of the judiciary as follows:GradeAnnual Allowance RateChief Justice President of the High Court Judge of the Supreme Court Judge of the High Court President of the Circuit Court President of the District Court€9,057.96 (€754.83 monthly)Judge of the Circuit Court€2,730.02 (€227.50 monthly)Judge of the District Court€1,365.01 (€113.75 monthly)Travel and subsistence expenses are payable to judges for travel and subsistence necessarily incurred for attendance in court away from their home location.

Despite this, on 3 March last, the then Minister for Defence, Éamon Ó Cuív TD, gave a direction to the Department of Defence that the re-organisation of the Defence Forces should progress on the basis that, inter alia, the Equitation School of the Defence Forces will be retained in the review of the Defence Vote programmes and expenditure arising from the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  Whilst I currently have no plans to discontinue the operation of the Army Equitation School, I will be keeping the matter under review, the previous Minister's direction notwithstanding.

The purpose of the Scheme is to provide means acceptable to the parties for the determination of claims and proposals relating to matters such as remuneration, other conditions of service and career development. It also allows the Representative Side to bring forward for discussion subjects not listed under the scheme if the Minister agrees they are appropriate for discussion by the Council.  The scheme provides a range of fora for engagement with the Associations, from Council and subcommittee meetings to less formal meeting and contacts. There is extensive engagement with both Associations in relation to the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Croke Park).  It is the aim of the parties to ensure administration and implementation of the scheme in consonance with the true spirit of conciliation and arbitration as it obtains to the public service generally.  The existence of the scheme does not imply that the Government has surrendered or can surrender its liberty of action in the exercise of its constitutional authority and the discharge of its responsibilities in the public interest.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	689	The Department is engaged in ongoing capital building and maintenance programmes designed to modernise and enhance the living, training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces.  The capital building programme focuses mainly on infrastructural projects comprising the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings. The ongoing maintenance programme ensures that necessary repairs are carried out at all military installations.Under the capital programme there has been considerable capital investment in various military installations over the last number of years. Major projects completed in the last number of years include a new Avionics Workshop at Casement Aerodrome (approximate cost €3m), the refurbishment of the Brigade HQ and Military Medical Facility at Collins Barracks in Cork (approximate cost €2.8m) and the upgrade of ‘E' Block in Aiken Barracks (approximate cost €2m). Major projects completed in the Curragh include the new Armoured Vehicle Garaging Facility (approximate cost €2.2m), the re-roofing of the Military Medical Facility (approximate cost €1.0m) and the new Heritage Centre (approximate cost €0.8m).The Capital Budget for 2011 is €8.64 million. New projects commencing in 2011 include the refurbishment of the McDonagh Barracks Catering Centre and the construction of a new Administration Building, both in the Curragh, the new Automated Marking System Firing Range at Lynch Camp in Kilworth and the replacement of Hangar No. 1 at Casement Aerodrome.  In addition to the capital budget a further €5m has been made available for on-going maintenance works.I am satisfied that there is sufficient funding available to allow a continuation of the programmes to ensure that members of the Defence Forces have the best possible facilities available to meet their needs.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as of 31 May 2011, the latest date for which figures are available, was 9,650 comprising 7,847 Army, 787 Air Corps and 1,016 Naval Service personnel. The total number of commissioned officers serving as of 31 May 2011 was 1,350.  The total strength of the Reserve Defence Force as of 31 May 2011 was 5,642, comprising 5,420 Army reserve and 222 Naval reserve.The approved Employment Control Framework for the Permanent Defence Force is based on a figure of 10,000 all ranks, appropriately configured across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. In 2011, the Defence Organisation, like all areas of the public service, is operating on a reduced budget. The programme for Government also sets out a target for further fiscal consolidation over the period to 2015.  In the context of the Employment Control Framework and the available resource envelope, the Military Authorities and officials of the Department are now in the process of agreeing a restructuring of the Permanent Defence Force to ensure its capability to meet the roles assigned to it by Government.Overall numbers in the Permanent Defence Force, including numbers serving at various ranks will be subject to ongoing control and monitoring on a monthly basis. This is to ensure compliance within the overall parameters and controls set by Government for each sector. The ECF also sets out that it will be necessary to underpin the re-organisation with the required amendments to Regulations and Administrative Instructions.I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The current Irish Exclusive Economic Zone, (EEZ) or Exclusive Fishery Limits, (EFL) extends to 200 miles offshore and covers an area of 132,000 nautical square miles which is equivalent to an area of 175,000 square land miles.  This represents 16% of EU waters. The size of the EFL for surveillance purposes is more relevant than the length of the shoreline.  The UK for example has a much longer shoreline than the Republic of Ireland but due to its proximity to Ireland, France and other countries, its EFL only extends to a much shorter distance.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary including coastal areas.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time, and all vessels are multi-tasked in that they undertake general surveillance security and other duties while conducting their primary day-to-day tasking of providing a fishery protection service. The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery and drug interdiction operations.Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our EEZ using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.Funding is available from the EU under the Fisheries Control Programmes to strengthen fishery surveillance systems in Member State countries.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps through my Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, apply on an annual basis for EU funding for projects that enhance their fisheries surveillance role.In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group (MarSur WG), chaired by the Department of Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, was established under the auspices of the Maritime Co-ordination Group of Assistant Secretaries. The Working Group is working towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.  The National MarSur project is mirroring attempts in the EU for countries to share their maritime data with the national authorities of other countries within the EU.  The Department of Defence and the Naval Service are represented on this Group along with other Government Departments and Agencies responsible for safety and security in the maritime environment. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which chairs the Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group is currently investigating the possibility of accessing funding at EU level to assist in progressing the National MarSur project.Ireland along with some other EU countries participate in the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre — Narcotics (MAOC-N).  This Centre has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resource sharing from all active members. An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.I am satisfied that the necessary supports and resources at both national and international level are available to the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist them in this challenging work.

The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 446 personnel, the EU-led Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 44 personnel and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.  Ireland is currently participating in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG), which has been on stand-by since 1 January 2011 and which will stand down on Thursday next 30 June 2011.  The other countries contributing to the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  Our contribution is a Recce/ISTAR. Recce is an abbreviation of Reconnaissance. ISTAR is an acronym for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target, Acquisition and Reconnaissance.  Recce/ISTAR Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters amounting to approximately 150 personnel.Ireland is also committed to participation in the Austro-German led Battlegroup, which will be on stand-by for the second six months of 2012.  Other contributors to the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).  Ireland's contribution to this Battlegroup will again be a Recce/ISTAR Company.The total of 563 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas represents a significant contribution to international peacekeeping operations and the obligations Ireland has assumed through its membership of the UN.  The recent deployment to UNIFIL has significantly increased the number of troops serving overseas, compared to the numbers serving in recent times.The Department constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  It is currently examining options for future deployments and in this regard, it has been in contact with the European Union and United Nations in relation to their requirements for missions.  However, following the deployment to UNIFIL and given the current financially straitened circumstances, it is not anticipated that there will be any major deployments of troops to further missions in the foreseeable future.

All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.  The number of patrol vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.  A contract was awarded in October 2010 following an open tender competition to Babcock Marine in the UK for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. Preparations for the construction of these new vessels have commenced and the first new vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second vessel will follow one year later.  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the Naval Service has ships available at all times to carry out their maritime taskings.

The Air Corps training plan is structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to the Air Corps by Government.  On the issue of equipment, I am satisfied that the equipment and aircraft available to the Air Corps are of a high standard and maintained by the Air Corps in accordance with best practice. The main expenditure in the Air Corps in 2011 relates to the maintenance and Power by the Hours contracts set up to keep the fleet fully operational.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide assistance in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role under the multi-agency Framework in response to emergencies that may arise.  Both the Air Corps and Naval Service assist regularly in major and minor emergencies that arise.  In May of this year, the Air Corps responded to a request from the Local Authorities to assist in fire-fighting efforts in Counties Donegal and Mayo where forest and gorse fires had broken out.  The Naval Service is regularly called upon to assist the Irish Coast Guard with search and rescue emergencies and pollution threats. In relation to Naval Service resources, following an open tender competition a contract was awarded in October 2010 to Babcock Marine in the UK for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. Preparations for the construction of these new vessels have commenced and the first new vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second vessel will follow one year later. The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the Naval Service will continue to be resourced at a level that will provide for their rapid deployment to emergencies that may arise.There has been very significant investment in resources for the Air Corps in recent years. The comprehensive investment programme included the acquisition of Pilatus training aircraft at a total cost of €60m, two light utility EC 135 helicopters at a cost of €12.8m, six utility AW 139 helicopters at a cost of €75m, and a major mid life upgrade on the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft at a cost of €16.5m. The main expenditure in the Air Corps in 2011 relates to the maintenance and Power by the Hours contracts set up to keep the fleet fully operational.  The acquisition of these aircraft together with their maintenance programmes ensure that the Air Corps have the necessary resources available to respond to taskings they are assigned including local and national emergencies.I am satisfied that the Air Corps and Naval Service have the necessary resources available to them to assist in emergencies that may arise.

The person named initially submitted an application in 2008 when the Scheme was closed to new applicants.  Following the temporary reopening of the Scheme an application from the person named was accepted on 24  September 2009.  My Department was not in a position to approve this application as the scheme conditions were not met.  The application was submitted under the provision of the Early Retirement Scheme that envisaged the transferee being set up under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme.  As that scheme is closed to new applicants, the transferee in this case could not satisfy that requirement.My Department wrote to the person named on 8th February 2010, offering him the option of resubmitting the application under an alternative provision of the Scheme which involved the holding being enlarged by the transferee.  The person named resubmitted a valid application on 6th April 2010 and it is from this date that he is entitled to receive payment.

As the Deputy will be aware, it is not within my competence to alter the dates of entry into force of EU Directives.  However, I am examining the situation in relation to funding for the projects concerned under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme in the context of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review which is under way and I will make an announcement on the matter in the near future.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	710	An application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on the 1st of May 2010.  This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility inspection.  During the course of this inspection discrepancies were uncovered with regard to a number of parcels and their eligibility for the schemes or whether the person named had a right to claim the parcels on his application form.As a result of this decision the total area claimed of 111.94ha was reduced to 55.55ha.  As the number of entitlements held is 109.94 and the difference between the area claimed, and the area found is greater than 20%, no payment was to issue for 2010.  The person named was formally notified of this decision on the 16th of March 2011.  He was also advised of his right to seek a review of this decision.  Such a request was submitted on the 14th April 2011 and a decision, upholding the original findings, was sent to the person named on the 6th of May 2011.  He was informed of his right to have the outcome of any the review appealed to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  To date, no such appeal has been lodged.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	715	Following on from my reply of 25th May 2011 in relation to this matter, I have again consulted the Registrar General of Fishing Boats, who is the Licensing Authority responsible for the licensing and registration of sea fishing boats and who acts independently in the exercise of his functions.  The Registrar General has informed me that he has two pieces of correspondence from the person referred to in your question and has taken account of them in his examination of the matter.  The first is a letter dated 7th February 2008 to the Registrar General referring to past contacts with officials in relation to an application that the writer had assisted with in the 1990s.  The letter did not provide any information that enabled an application to be traced.  The second was submitted to the Registrar General by the vessel owner's solicitor in April 2009.  This is a hand-written cover note which is dated 1 October 1999 accompanying a copy of a report of a survey of the boat carried out on 2 September 1999.  The letter refers to an application under this scheme having been made "a good number of years ago", but there are no other details that would assist in tracing an application or ongoing correspondence at the time.The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme was 17th February 1995, and the licensing and registration process for each vessel had to be completed by 16th March 2006.  Other than those referred to above, no correspondence or other communication with any party has come to light in relation to this matter in the period between the launch of the scheme in March 1994 and September/October 1999, and between September/October 1999 and early 2008, despite extensive searches.  The Registrar General further informs me that even if an application had been made before the closing date of February 1995, the licensing and registration process would have had to be completed by March 2006 when the Scheme closed in order for capacity to be awarded under the Scheme.It is open to the vessel owner to apply to license and register the vessel under current licensing policy.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	719	My Department submitted its ‘Action Plan' under the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement earlier this year.  In early May, the Department submitted its first progress report on the implementation of that Action Plan.  The report outlines the significant progress made by the Department, which has been engaged in a fundamental process of re-organisation, major reductions in staffing levels and improvement of its business processes, including major changes to the local office network.  The report shows a reduction of 173 staff and total administrative savings of nearly €14million (including non-pay savings of over €4.7 million) since the end of March 2010, the reporting period for the Agreement.Both the Action Plan and the Progress Report are published in full on my Department's website (please see 2011 Publications) and give comprehensive details of both the pay and non-pay savings to be achieved over the period of the Agreement to 2014.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	720	The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is included in Annex IV of Council Regulation (EC) 708/2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture.  Article 2(5) of the Regulation specifically exempts those species listed in Annex IV from the provisions of the Regulation, with the exceptions of articles 3 and 4.  Article 4 requires Member States to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid adverse effects to biodiversity, and especially to species, habitats and ecosystem functions which may be expected to arise, inter alia, from the spreading of these species into the wild.The exemption in the Regulation for the Pacific Oyster is that it has been in production for many years and has been moved from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  To assist in determining the future potential risk of widespread proliferation of the Pacific Oysterin Ireland the Marine Institute is funding a research study to document the level of reproductive effort of oysters grown on the seabed compared with the more traditional culture methods for this species .  This project is expected to be concluded this year and a full report prepared.In addition, an "Appropriate Assessment" under Article 6 of the Habitats Directive will be required in relation to Lough Swilly to facilitate the renewal of all aquaculture licences as the Lough has been designated as a ‘Natura' site.  The assessment will consider the likely interaction between activities (i.e. fisheries and aquaculture) and conservation objectives as set down by National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The question of the risk posed by the presence of pacific oysters, if any, will also be considered in the appropriate assessment.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	721	The individual referred to by the Deputy applied for an Aquaculture Licence in June 2010. The application, in accordance with standard procedure, was issued to my Department's scientific and technical advisors for comment. A delay has arisen as the area applied for has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and also a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 sites).In the case of aquaculture sites located within Natura 2000 areas my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of these areas.  This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  This comprehensive data collection programme, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue. The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications will be dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.My department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all outstanding cases having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.

Approval for such applications can only be granted in force majeure  or other duly justified cases, where production capacity has been temporarily affected.The person (details supplied), was granted a Ministerial Declaration for the 2010/2011 milk quota year. It was made clear to him at that time that my Department would not be in a position to consider any further applications for a declaration under the same circumstances in the following year.  As the circumstances outlined in the current application were the same as those submitted in the 2010/2011 application, the decision to refuse the application on this occasion has been upheld and notification of this decision has issued.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The Boarfish is a small pelagic species of fish which has in recent years become the target of commercial fishing by the Irish fleet.  Until 2011 no Total Allowable Catch (TAC) or national quota had been determined.At the EU Fisheries Council negotiations in 2010 when determining the TAC and Quota for 2011, of critical importance was ensuring that Ireland received a fair share of the Boarfish stock for 2011 and future years.  Despite major efforts from certain other Member States for the stock to be shared out equally between five or more Member States, Ireland secured a 67.3% share of this stock for 2011 and future years.The Irish quota for 2011 is set at 22,227 tonnes which was established on a precautionary basis as the scientific information to inform advice was limited.  Data on the stock is currently being compiled to  inform scientific advice which will be available later in the year.  It is hoped that, based on the scientific advice,  the TAC and quota will increase for future years.I intend to give careful consideration to how this quota will be distributed amongst the Irish fleet for 2011.  To this end, I requested proposals from the fishing industry on the matter. I have recently received these proposals and I am giving them careful consideration. I intend to decide arrangements, taking account of the views provided and the technicalities of this fishery,  in the near future and in good time for the commencement of the boarfish fishery season.

The request submitted on 4 May, 2011, to change the original application cannot be accommodated at this stage as participation in AEOS is a contractual commitment for at least 5 years as set out in the Terms & Conditions of the Scheme and in accordance with the EU rules governing the Scheme.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	725	My Department's responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming.  The relevant legislation in this area is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, SI 311 of 2010.  Animals "used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used" are outside the scope of SI 311 of 2010.  My Department must act at all times in accordance with legislation. The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including horses, in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for pursuing cases under this legislation rests with An Garda Síochána, who may on receipt of a complaint investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The European Directive and Regulations governing the export of poultry, chicks and hatching eggs are as follows:Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and (makes) specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation);Council Directive 2009/158/EC which lays down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards for eggs;Commission Regulation (EC) No. 617/2008 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards for eggs for hatching and farmyard poultry chicksStatutory Instrument No. 564 of 2010 European Communities (Poultry and Hatching Eggs) Regulations 2010 gives legal effect to these regulations.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	727	The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is the competent authority with responsibility for the agricultural provisions of the Single Market. We implement and manage the relevant suite of legislation agreed at EU level in this area.  Much of this legislation is specific to particular sectors and includes Council Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2007, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 617/2008 and Council Directive 2009/158/EC which deal with the operation and functioning of the Single Market and the detailed rules to be applied in the marketing and trade of poultry, chicks and eggs.Other government departments have responsibility for different topics, including food safety which comes under the aegis of the Department of Health.The success of the internal market is contingent on the application of horizontal public and animal health standards which require the registration and monitoring of Food Business Operators to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. It is critically important for the growth and development of Irish exports in the agri-food sector that Ireland maintains its reputation for the highest standards of quality and food safety and to this end my department, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, is scrupulous in the application of the various provisions of both domestic and European legislation.Food Harvest 2020 has targeted a 10% increase in the value of poultry output. Work towards this target will be aided by a number of initiatives which have been taken in the areas of animal welfare, disease surveillance and food safety.

He was also informed of his right to appeal the outcome of a review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals office.  To date, no such review request has been submitted.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The European Commission has been working on the functioning of commodity and commodity derivatives markets for several years. In the 2009 Communication on a better functioning supply chain, the Commission announced measures to improve oversight and the overall transparency of EU agricultural commodity derivatives.  In its Communication of 2 June 2010 on "Regulating Financial Services for Sustainable Growth", the Commission announced that it is preparing a comprehensive, balanced and ambitious set of policy initiatives which will touch upon commodity derivatives markets. As part of this ongoing process, the EU is cooperating with the OECD and the FAO to ensure a global response to a global issue.The EU is also seeking stronger controls on export bans and trade restrictions as these can lead to supply shortages.  In conjunction with the FAO the EU intends to provide more detailed information on agriculture resources and markets.  The European Commission will make publicly available its short term forecasts of the main EU agricultural markets covering the current and next marketing years. In addition it will seek to make information with respect to European private stocks more complete.A sound functioning of agricultural futures markets and their convergence with physical markets for agricultural commodities is of primary importance for the European agricultural sector, to manage risk and hedge positions. Improving transparency of and oversight over agricultural futures markets will benefit farmers, co-operatives and agricultural industries that rely on these reformed markets.  Looking ahead, there is a need to revisit this issue within the WTO and to come forward with new draft provisions, which could place more constraint on consistent "net-exporters" of essential commodities like grains (mainly wheat and rice) in the future. Provisions should not only be limited to emergency/humanitarian situations, where broad agreement appears in sight, but also ensure through appropriate criteria that recourse to export bans and restrictions will remain limited to situations of genuine critical foodstuff shortages in the exporting WTO Member.The Commission will propose changes to the existing framework governing the integrity, efficiency and transparency of financial markets. The review of the Market Abuse Directive will, inter alia, clarify what kind of trading in commodity markets could constitute abuse and ensure that all venues and transactions where abuse may occur are appropriately covered by common EU rules.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	732	The Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation advise that the following is the situation with regard to European sources of loan finance available to SMEs in Ireland:The European Union provides support to European small and medium-sized enterprisesindifferent formssuch as grants, loans and, in some cases, guarantees.  Support is available either directly or through programmes managed at national or regional level, such as the European Union's Structural Funds. SMEs can also benefit from a series of non-financial assistance measures in the form of programmes and business support services.The European Commission's European Portal for SMEs http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sme/funding_en.htm presents details of the main European programmes available to SMEs and contains brief information as well as the main web sites for each programme.  However,  the information included on the website, is not exhaustive.In addition, the Enterprise Europe Network provide information on both national and EU financial supports.  The financial instruments mentioned on these sites are managed by the European Investment Fund and implemented via financial intermediaries or specialised funds, to which those interested should refer directly. The main Programmes are referred to below.Under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) 2007-2013, €1.13 billion has been allocated for financial instruments for the above period.  These are organised under three schemes, which are managed on behalf of the European Commission by the European Investment Fund (EIF):The High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) aims to increase the supply of equity for innovative SMEs both in their early stages (GIF1) and in the expansion phase (GIF2). GIF shares risk and reward with private equity investors, providing important leverage for the supply of equity to innovative companies.The SME Guarantee Facility provides additional guarantees to guarantee schemes, in order to increase the supply of debt finance to SMEs. It concentrates on addressing market failures in four areas:access to loans (or loan substitutes such as leasing) by SMEs with growth potential;provision of microcredit;access to equity or quasi-equity;securitisation.A Capacity Building Scheme supports the capacity of financial intermediaries in some Member States.The decision of any eligible Irish undertaking, including financial institutions, to make an application under any particular EU scheme would be a commercial matter for the institution involved.  Applications are between the undertaking involved and the relevant EU institution providing support. The Irish Authorities would not necessarily be made aware of individual applications made to EU support schemes which allow for direct applications.  In relation to the SME Guarantee Facility, I am aware that one Irish microfinance lender benefits from the scheme.The EIF's own activities are based on two instruments:EIF's Venture Capital Instruments consist of capital investments in venture capital funds and business incubators that support SMEs, particularly those that are newly created and technology-oriented.EIF's guarantee instruments consist of providing guarantees to financial institutions that cover credits to SMEs.This Programme is managed and the projects selected at national and/or regional level.JEREMIE is a joint initiative of the European Commission and the European Investment Fund with the European Investment Bank. It aims to improve access to finance for micro to medium-sized enterprises and in particular the supply of micro-credit, venture capital finance or guarantees and other forms of innovative financing. JEREMIE is managed as an integral part of European Regional Development Fund programmes.These schemes do not provide direct funding to SMEs, but are usually processed through financial intermediaries such as banks, credit institutions or investment funds. They are intended to increase the volume of credit available to SMEs and to encourage these intermediaries to develop their SME lending capacity .The European Progress Microfinance Facility was launched in 2010 and is managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) on behalf of the European Commission. Under the European Progress Microfinance Facility, €100 million will be made available, spread over four years from 2010 to 2013, to support employment, the development of micro enterprises and the social economy across all European Union Member States. It aims to increase lending activity to micro-borrowers through a wide range of financial intermediaries such as non-bank micro finance institutions, micro-banks, dedicated microfinance companies or investment funds, local savings banks, smaller cooperative banks, smaller development banks or institutions and selected commercial banks. As such, the EIF will not be providing direct financing to borrowers but will be facilitating lending through a range of financial support mechanisms. These supports will include guarantee instruments and funding of financial intermediaries.The first support mechanism under the Microfinance Facility involves a micro-loan facility under which EIF will provide a guarantee instrument to financial intermediaries providing micro-loans. Availing of this facility will still require the intermediary to bear some element of the loan risk. Applications can be made to the EIF until 31 December 2013. It is the EIF's responsibility to assess applications for guarantees and requests for financing from intermediaries, to present these requests to competent bodies for approval, to negotiate contracts with intermediaries and to monitor operations. Such applications are made directly to the EIF and do not require any national intervention.Under EU Cohesion Policy 2007-13, the European Commission has a number of joint initiatives with the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund aimed at improving access to finance using financing engineering instruments. One of these instruments is JASMINE (Joint Action to support microfinance institutions in Europe), a pilot initiative by the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. JASMINE seeks to improve access to finance for small businesses and for socially excluded people and ethnic minorities, who want to become self-employed. This initiative, in line with the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, aims to make small loans, or micro-credit, more widely available in EuropeIn addition to the above Schemes, the European Investment Bank (EIB) provides support for Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help mitigate the effects of the current credit crisis through a €30 billion facility to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks. Participation in the facility is, in the first instance, a commercial decision for individual financial institutions, who are responsible for evaluating loan applications submitted by individual SMEs. Irish banks have benefited from the European Investment Banks (EIB) loans for SMEs.  In 2009, the EIB made €300m available to Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Ulster Bank for onward lending to SMEs carrying out investment projects.  This was additional to €50m previously made available to Bank Of Scotland Ireland through its UK parent.The Irish Enterprise Europe Network services in Ireland are delivered by Enterprise Ireland, together with Chambers of Commerce from Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford and can be contacted on the following website address:http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/enterpriseeuropenetworkirelandAny Irish SMEs or financial intermediaries wishing to obtain detailed information on accessing any of the European Funds outlined above or indeed, other European funding initiatives, should contact the Irish Enterprise Europe Network in the first instance.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	748	I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 and 535 together.The correspondence supplied by the Deputy is seeking his personal views and understanding on independent living for people with disabilities. However, the Government's central policy objective for people with disabilities is that people should be supported "to lead full and independent lives, to participate in work and society and to maximise their potential".  In line with this policy, the Government's Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 contains a commitment to "ensure that the quality of life for people with disabilities is enhanced and that resources allocated reach the people who need them.".Research, both international and national, confirms that the needs of people with a disability are most appropriately met and provided in their home and community and that this provides a more sustainable model for the provision of care. The Government's commitment to people with disabilities is one whereby the focus of any supports should be based on individual need as much as possible and, while there is no "one size fits all" solution, the focus of supports should favour the individual rather than an organisation or service provider. A review of the efficiency and effectiveness of disability services funded from the Health Vote is currently underway and will be completed later this year. As part of this review an Expert Reference Group was established to review current policy in relation to disability services. Although it is important not to pre-empt any recommendation that may arise out of this process,  a key theme emerging is the need for a shift in funding from organisations to individuals. This might or might not involve the transfer of actual funds to the individual. While direct payment may be considered in the future, a shorter term goal would be the transfer to the individual of choice and control over support and care decisions through the mechanism of individualised budgeting.On 3rd December 2010 the Department published, on its website, a summary of the key proposals emerging from the review of disability policy. It proposes a re-framing of disability services towards a model of individualised supports and the main-streaming of all public services. State funding would be allocated based on an independent assessment of individual needs. Following the needs assessment, individual support plans would be drawn up and individualised budgets allocated from which the supports and services needed would be purchased.I understand that the Health Service Executive is supporting a direct payments model for two people with a disability in the Cavan Monaghan area. In addition my Department through the Genio Trust is supporting a new innovative initiative for five individuals to manage and direct their personal assistant supports by receiving direct payments to purchase the supports they decide they need. The evaluation of this initiative will inform the implementation of the policy proposals currently being developed.While the focus is on the shift in funding from organisations to individuals, individualised funding and direct payments are not one and the same. With direct payments the transfer involves the actual direct payment of cash to the service user. With individualised funding, the main transfer of resources to the service user is the transfer of some control over decisions. This might or might not involve the transfer of actual funds to the individual. While there may potentially be some form of direct payment in the future, the more significant change is likely to be the transfer of control and choice. Therefore it is not proposed to introduce a personal assistance act at this stage.

Patients need a service that is timely and effective.A key immediate priority is the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which I announced on the 1st of June.  The purpose of the SDU is to tackle hospital system inefficiencies and unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system and by streamlining waiting lists.  The SDU's priorities will encompass reducing the waiting times for admission from Emergency Departments,  reduction in in-patient and out-patient waiting times and improved access to diagnostics.I have appointed Dr Martin Connor, an international expert, as the Senior Advisor on the SDU.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.  The resources of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will be refocused to align with the work of the SDU and, crucially, will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation's hospitals.In addition to the SDU, there are a number of encouraging initiatives underway to alleviate this problem. In HSE South, these include:additional staffinga physiotherapy initiativevalidation of waiting listsimproved management of OPD processes, including reducing missed appointments (DNAs — Did Not Attend) and increasing the numbers of new patients seen at clinicsAdditional Consultant PostsIn the HSE South, there are 5 permanent consultant orthopaedic surgeons in post in the trauma and elective service, with 2 locum consultants in the trauma service.  There are currently 100 referrals per week. This has increased over the past twelve months, with two new permanent consultants providing revision surgery.HSE South has approval for three consultant orthopaedic surgeon posts at Cork University Hospital/South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  These are:2 orthopaedic surgeons with a special interest in paediatric orthopaedic surgery — new posts1 orthopaedic general surgeon — a replacement postRecruitment has been completed and it is anticipated that formal letters of appointment will be issued soon.Physiotherapy InitiativePhysiotherapist-led clinics were introduced in 2010, to address the waiting list for OPD appointments.  The physiotherapists triage patients based on the longest waiters, primarily from the hip and knee lists.  35% of the patients seen at these clinics were referred to an orthopaedic consultant for surgical review.  A review of this initiative has been completed, in order to continue to improve patient flows.Approval for three additional physiotherapists under the Outpatient Programme for Rheumatology and Orthopaedics has been sanctioned. These posts will allow for more musculo-skeletal physiotherapy led clinics.  The recruitment process has begun.HSE National OPD Project:At national level, an Outpatients Department (OPD) Performance Improvement Group has been established to improve OPD Services throughout the country.  The Project aims to address the significant numbers on waiting lists for some specialties.  This Project will standardise all aspects of OPD, including waiting lists validation, management of DNAs, improvement in new to return ratios and improved triaging.Cork University Hospital and South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital have been selected to participate in the initial phase of this project.Cork University Hospital is undertaking a validation exercise on its OPD waiting lists.  This exercise will link in with the National OPD Programme on the validation protocol, particularly for the clinical governance process for removing patients from waiting lists and for GP involvement in the process.  It is expected that this exercise will reduce the numbers on the waiting list.GP Referral ProjectUnder the reorganisation of acute hospital services in Cork and Kerry, electronic GP referral to acute hospitals is being piloted.  This will enable more efficient processing of referrals and allow patients and GPs to see waiting times for individual consultants.I believe that the implementation of these initiatives will greatly improve waiting list numbers and I will be closely monitoring the situation to ensure that these statistics become a thing of the past.The management of waiting lists is a matter for the HSE and the individual hospitals concerned.  I have therefore referred the Deputy's question regarding the numbers of patients awaiting orthopaedic treatment to the Executive for direct reply.

However, as a result of the limited public transport service in Co. Donegal, the HSE/North Western Health Board has for many years provided free transport services to day centres, day hospitals and other services.In the current financial climate, it is not sustainable for the HSE to continue to provide a free transport service in the Donegal area; it is more important that resources focus on continued service delivery.  In order to sustain transport services and provide access to HSE services, local HSE Management is working closely with Seirbhís Iompair Tuaithe Teoranta (SITT), MFG and Inishowen Development Partnership — community based not-for-profit rural transport companies.This approach will help to support a local community group as well as ensuring that the transport services that people need to access services will be there in the future.  The scheme has been implemented in the rest of the county and has been very successful. It will be commenced in the Inishowen area during the third quarter of 2011.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	758	In June 2006, the Report of a Working Group on haemochromatosis was published.  It examined the nature and extent of haemochromatosis in Ireland and advised on the actions necessary to address the problems caused by it.  The Report makes a series of recommendations relating to the management and treatment of haemochromatosis.  The report was circulated to the HSE and other relevant organisations for implementation.The HSE is currently formulating a programme to ensure that everyone with haemochromatosis will have early access to diagnosis and treatment in every part of the country.  This approach will include a programme of awareness among primary and secondary care clinicians including GPs, hospital doctors, nurses in primary, secondary and community care roles, nutritionists and physiotherapists.It is envisaged that access to quality care will be provided by an integrated programme of community-based and hospital-based diagnostic and regular review services.  This will be combined with easy-access community-based phlebotomy clinics in appropriate locations throughout the country.  Many people with haemochromatosis are eligible to become blood donors, and many already do so both at regular blood donation clinics and especially at a specific clinic held every week by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  This has been a very successful and welcome development, and it is expected that increased access of donors with haemochromatosis to regular blood donation clinics will form part of the programme.In addition, a sum of €100,000 was granted to the Irish Haemochromatosis Association, from my Department's National Lottery funding, in December 2010 to support the Association in raising awareness about the condition.  The Association, which has around 1,600 members, has an informative website and publishes regular newsletters.  With the additional funding it intends to publish and circulate information to GPs, practice nurses and newly diagnosed patients and to create greater awareness of the condition among medical professionals and the general public.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I propose to take Questions Nos. 476 to 481, inclusive, together.The introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in October 2009 brought about a fundamental change in the way in which long-term nursing home care is funded and, consequently, the way in which nursing homes and community hospitals are funded.  In the past, public and voluntary nursing homes would have been allocated a lump sum annually.  In contrast, the new scheme supports the individuals in need of long-term residential care, not the facilities providing the care.  This means that funding follows the patients and ensures that these facilities are not being funded for empty beds.The legislation underpinning the scheme encompasses a principle of patient choice.  Once an individual has received financial approval for the scheme, s/he can choose any nursing home that is participating in the scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to meet their particular care needs.  This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.  Finally, the scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care.  Nursing homes and community hospitals can continue to have separate agreements with the HSE for the provision of other services, e.g. day care, respite and convalescence.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	769	The Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 for the health sector gives effect to Government priorities on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2014.  The Framework is designed to maintain tight control on the cost of providing public services while protecting front-line services as far as possible.  It is necessary to ensure that there is sustainability in the cost of providing public services relative to the Government's revenue.The Framework allows for the targeted growth of certain grades which are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment (including Medical Consultants, Physiotherapists and Social Workers) in order to deliver on key priority services.  It also provides for the filling of non-exempted posts on exceptional grounds in order to maintain essential services and to meet priority service change/reorganisation requirements.In recognition of the significant number of psychiatric nurses who have retired in recent times, the 2010 Employment Control Framework for the health service provided an exemption from the moratorium and allowed the filling of 100 psychiatric nursing posts.  The more recent 2011 Framework again provides an exemption from the moratorium in respect of 100 psychiatric nursing posts where they are required to support the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The 2011 exemption allows these posts to be filled by nurses and/or other disciplines in community mental health teams.  The allocation of these posts to particular service locations / geographical areas is being identified by the HSE National Care Group Lead for Mental Health in consultation with my Department.It is not necessary to advertise a recruitment scheme for psychiatric nurses at this time as the HSE has advised that it already has panels of appropriately qualified nurses in place.The issue of the appointment of a suicide prevention nurse in Roscommon County Hospital is an operational matter for the HSE in respect of which I have asked them to reply to you directly.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	784	I understand that the Deputy's question refers to a table contained in the first progress report of the Implementation Body on the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (Table 2, Sustainable Pay Savings).   I have been informed that the Implementation Body calculated the payroll savings by using an average annualised saving per employee, arising from the overall reduction in numbers in the public sector (5,349 staff), during the review period of March 2010 to March 2011.  This was to take account of the fact that employee number reductions arose at different times during the year.  This figure includes savings due to numbers reductions and other reductions in the cost of the public service pay bill (e.g. in overtime, allowances etc).In relation to the health sector, a detailed breakdown of the employee numbers reduction, by grade category, is set out in tabular format below.  This table was provided to the Implementation Body, as part of the Health Sector progress report on implementation of the Health Sector Action Plan and savings under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, for the period March 2010 to March 2011.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I am committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular, I want to ensure that services are provided safely and in the setting most appropriate to patients' needs.I have made it clear previously that I intended to consider the current provision of orthopaedic services in St Mary's fully before any move went ahead.  I also had to take into account the unprecedented economic and financial situation the country is facing and the requirement to reduce public spending in line with the EU/IMF programme.  In order to fully consider the issues involved in the proposed changes to the delivery of regional orthopaedic services in Cork and Kerry, I have recently held discussions with the Health Service Executive, including senior clinicians, and with local representatives.I have now reflected and considered the matter and it is my view that, on balance, the move of orthopaedic services should go ahead as planned.  The relocation of services to the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital will provide a range of improvements in the facilities for, and the efficiency of,  elective surgery for the people of Cork and Kerry, including the recommencement of paediatric orthopaedic services in Cork and an increased level of elective surgery.I have also made it clear that health services should continue to be provided at the St Mary's campus, including the planned Urgent Care Centre and outpatient services linked to the Mercy University Hospital along with other services.  There is also potential, in line with my determination to develop primary care services, for a primary care centre, which I have asked the HSE to examine.  This could provide much needed services to the area, which is one of particular social disadvantage.  However I am making no commitment in this respect and I would want to be assured of the position of the relevant General Practitioners before taking any further action.It is essential that there be a full engagement with the staff of St Mary's in relation to their relocation and also to address any clinical or other concerns that they have.  I have asked the HSE South to begin this process immediately.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	788	Cord blood is a source of stem cells, which have proven therapeutic benefit for a number of conditions, principally the treatment of blood conditions.  Stem cells may also be obtained from bone marrow.  It is important to note that many potential benefits of stem cells are at very early investigative stages and will require substantiation through clinical trials.Ireland does not currently have a public cord blood bank.  At present, when clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.Collection of cord blood for private use in low risk families is not provided publicly in Ireland.  While recognising that science in this area is evolving, the HSE sought and considered expert professional clinical opinion as well as legal advice in relation to this matter.   As a result, it has determined that staff at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE should not undertake the procurement of cord blood for commercial entities.  The HSE must ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.  In addition, the contracting of staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, to undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of commercial companies, was outside the cover provided under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.Any hospital wishing to accommodate staff directly employed by third party commercial entities to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE must therefore ensure that all appropriate arrangements are in place within the context of a robust clinical governance framework to control risks associated with the service.  A contract, or service level agreement, should be in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  Policies, procedures and guidelines are required to govern how the service is provided.  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring a robust clinical governance framework to support a safe and high quality maternity care system.  My Department will keep the emergence of clinical benefits of cord blood banking under constant review.  While the HSE's primary objective is to ensure that there is a safe and high quality maternity service it should correct this anomaly that has not allowed the banking of cord blood cells in cases where patients are anxious for this to happen and are prepared to fund the cost so that no additional cost is borne by the hospital.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	789	I announced the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) on 1 June. This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister for Health.  The SDU is a key part of the Government's plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of introducing a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).I have appointed Dr. Martin Connor as the Special Advisor on the SDU.  Dr. Connor is an international expert, with a proven track record in health service transformation.  He has extensive experience in the NHS and led a similar initiative in Northern Ireland with considerable success.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.  I will be meeting Dr Connor this week to review his progress to date.The SDU will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU will work closely with the HSE, building on initiatives already underway including the clinical programmes.The SDU's priorities will encompass:Emergency Departments — waiting times for admission have been unacceptably high in a number of hospitals, often breaching the current 6-hour maximum waiting time target.In-patient waiting times — the trend has been upwards recently, despite the work of the NTPF.Out-patient waiting times — the time from GP referral to an appointment with a consultant is unacceptably long in many specialties.Access to diagnostics — this forms an essential part of the patient journey for all of the areas of access above.Its success will allow for an alteration in the current role of the NTPF.  Its resources will be re-focused to align closely with the work of the SDU, and crucially will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation's hospitals.  For the moment the NTPF will continue to operate as normal, accepting applications from persons who have been waiting for over three months for treatment.  An immediate priority for the SDU will be to ensure that waiting lists for inpatient services are managed properly and that hospitals take responsibility for managing patient flows. I cannot accept a position where some hospitals allow small numbers of patients to wait more than a year for their procedures.  The NTPF has welcomed the new initiative and has confirmed it will work proactively with the Unit to achieve the best possible result for patients.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	815	There are currently almost 2,300 GPs contracted by the HSE under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme to provide services to medical card and GP visit card patients.  Under this Scheme patients can select a GP in their locality who is on the HSE's list of GMS GPs.  If a medical card or GP visit card holder is unsuccessful in being accepted on to a GP's patient list, the HSE can assign the eligible patient to a GMS GP in the locality.The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support provides for the introduction of legislation to remove restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients under the GMS Scheme. My colleague, the Minister for Health, will bring a Memorandum to Government this week on proposals for legislation to set the terms of access for suitably qualified GPs to GMS contracts.  This proposed legislation will result in medical card and GP visit card patients having a greater choice of GPs under the GMS Scheme.  It will also help to ensure that private patients of new GP contract holders, who qualify for a medical card or GP visit card, will not have to change their GP. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future as to how this will be implemented.

The aim of the report will be to provide an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland, and an examination of the Irish practice relative to other countries. It will include an assessment of the circumstances in which the procedure was carried out, what protocols or guidance existed at the time to guide professional practice, and details of when the practice changed and why.It is my intention that the academic researcher will carry out this work on an objective and independent basis. Following receipt of this report, which is due to be received in September 2011, my Department will further engage with patient representative groups. I will then quickly decide on the next steps required to address this situation.

The shortage of suitable NCHDs is an issue worldwide. The HSE has taken a range of actions to address NCHD vacancies to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimized and patient safety maintained.I am in ongoing discussions with the HSE and various stakeholders in order to identify a solution to the recruitment of NCHD's nationwide.  I will have greater clarity on this issue in the next few weeks. In addition, my Department is at an advanced stage of drafting a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007, facilitating the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period.I can assure you that the necessary steps are being taken in order to ensure ongoing safe delivery of service in hospitals and in Emergency Departments in particular.

No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.The RSA has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements. The testing function is carried out by Applus+, since January 2010, under a contractual arrangement with the RSA. Award of the contract for carrying out the NCT and the criteria applying thereto is a matter for the RSA.The NCT Contractor provides a leaflet to customers containing advice on preparing for the NCT.  This leaflet and the five most common causes for failure in the previous year are available on the NCT website www.ncts.ie  The NCT Manual which sets out full details of the test requirements is available to download from the NCTS website or at www.rsa.ie
In 2010 less than 0.1% of tests received a complaint and customer service surveys undertaken this year shows that over 83% of respondents expressed satisfaction with the service.A person who is of the view that they were incorrectly refused an NCT certificate has the right to appeal the decision. The NCT grievance process consists of 3 stages; through the NCTS internal appeals process, through the independent appeals procedure operated by the Automobile Association (AA) and lastly by appeal to the District Court. In 2010 the independent appeals board received 21 appeals in relation to the test outcome of the 893,000 tests that were completed by NCTS. Seventeen of these appeals were rejected with 4 being upheld.Should the Deputy have information or concern regarding vehicles that failed the NCT, details of the vehicles, including registration numbers, should be forwarded to the RSA which will arrange to have the issues investigated.

The company has advised me that  it continues to engage with the Port Company and potential customers, to establish if a viable commercial case exists to reopen the line. Iarnród Eireann is keen to ensure that the zinc from Pallas Green can be moved by rail to whichever port it is ultimately exported from.As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport my responsibility is for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. Decisions in relation to transport projects will be taken in the context of the Capital Review, which is currently underway.Given the difficult financial situation the first  priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain existing investments and to maintain high safety standards. This of necessity will restrict the funding for new projects with only those offering the highest return and which  contribute to overall economic and transport objectives  and, are affordable, having any chance of being prioritised.  Iarnrod Eireann have made a submission to the Department regarding their priorities for funding under the transport capital  programme and final decisions will be made in the context of the new National Development Plan  to be published in the Autumn.

As normally applies, the day rates applicable are the Class A day rates effective from 5 March 2009.  Ministers and Ministers of State may also claim the vouched cost of a hotel room (including tax and up to 15% service charge). The payment of subsistence to Ministers is on the same basis as that payable to civil servants.Where Ministers travel abroad or to Northern Ireland they may claim the following. The vouched cost of a hotel room and up to 15% service charge plus the Class A civil service conference rate increased by 1/3, with the exception of the USA and Canada, where it increased by 1/2.In relation to other allowances, I and my Ministers of State also receive the Ministerial rate of the Parliamentary Standard Allowance (PSA), details of which are published on the Oireachtas website, along with a secretarial allowance which is available to TD's and Senators.The PSA for Ministers is lower than that for TDs and Senators as the Department provides us with phones. I have availed of the fully vouched option with regard to the PSA.

It is also an important method for facilitating the engagement of local communities and other stakeholders in the long term planning of the port.The Company has held a comprehensive public consultation on the masterplan, including a number of public events. I have urged all stakeholders to participate in the process.The issues paper published by the Company for consultative purposes raised a number of different options for consideration. Understandably different opinions exist on the future development of the port. A critical part of the masterplan process is to allow full participation of all stakeholders, so that their views can be taken account of by the company when finalising the masterplan later this year. I have not stated support for any of the particular options proposed. I have welcomed the process and the concept of the longterm masterplanning of ports.The port company has the very challenging task of fulfilling its statutory mandate to develop the country's primary maritime gateway in a way that minimises the environmental impact and maximises the benefits for the city and country as a whole. I believe that it is possible to strike that balance, and the masterplan will be an important step in that process.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I propose to take Questions Nos. 561 to 563, inclusive, together.The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 governs Salvage and Wreck issues. The day to day operation of the Act is the responsibility of the relevant Receiver of Wreck, who is an official of the Revenue Commissioners (Customs).  Salvage services for a state owned vessel are regulated in law in the same manner as other vessels. Under Section 32 of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, the owner, including the State, of a vessel, may prohibit its salvage.  However the circumstances of this individual case are not known to me so I cannot comment on any insurance implications.In general, depending on the individual case involved, the Receiver of Wreck, and/or an arbitrator, or the High Court, will determine whether or not payment is due to a salvor, and, if payment should be made, the amount and basis for such payment in relation to salvage operations carried out. In the case of a wreck which has been found and delivered to the Receiver of Wreck, the Receiver will restore the wreck to its owner, but not before payment of any salvage costs due. Any party not satisfied with the decision of the Receiver may seek to have the matter decided by an arbitrator or the High Court.Since the Receiver of Wreck deals with the payment of salvage costs, the salvor should be aware of the return of the vessel to its owner. However as the current legislation stands, there is no legal obligation on the Receiver of Wreck to inform the salvor of the return of a vessel to its owner.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	842	The recently published CIE accounts for 2010 showed a deficit of €53.597m for 2010. Within the context of such figures, and the fact that the state subvention to public transport providers will decrease significantly over the next number of years, I highlighted in public comment that the CIE companies will be required to look at further cost savings, service rationalisation and fare increases. Cost cutting should take precedence over fare increases and service reductions but fare increases and service reductions will be inevitable if costs cannot be reduced sufficiently. I will communicate same to the newly appointed chairs of the CIE companies when I present them with their letters of mandate in the coming days.Of course, any proposal by the CIÉ companies to vary bus or rail passenger fares requires the approval of the National Transport Authority (NTA), as part of its independent statutory mandate and the exercise of its powers to enter into public service contracts with the companies. I do not anticipate any fare increases in this calendar year. Fare increases do not require ministerial approval.
