          <p eId="para_9">I would like to welcome from HIQA Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector and director of regulation, and Ms Eva Boyle, inspection manager at HIQA's children's team. I thank them for appearing before us this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> May I also remind all parties to turn off their mobile phones as it interferes with the parliamentary reporters and the recording system, and our web streaming is adversely affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that you have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting. </p>
          <p eId="para_14">Our witnesses have kindly provided us with an opening statement but members have requested that the statement be taken as read. We will proceed to put questions to the witnesses, beginning with Deputy Anne Rabbitte.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">I thank the Chair and thank both witnesses for attending today. A report was completed in 2015 and another report has just been completed. What powers of enforcement does HIQA have, if any, in instances where service providers do not address findings of non-compliance? I am asking this in the context of the failure on the part of Oberstown to demonstrate that single separation was being used in line with policy and that accurate records were being maintained on the use of single separation. This was highlighted in the earlier report and is highlighted again in the most recent one. What actions can HIQA take, given that it is a red-line issue in two reports?</p>

          <from> Ms Mary Dunnion<recordedTime time="2017-11-28T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">I thank Deputy Rabbitte. We can take no action. HIQA and the directorate of regulation has several different functions but in the context of children and children's services, we monitor. In monitoring, we monitor against nationally mandated standards, we report our findings, we can escalate the risk within the context of the service provider and to Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but we have absolutely no enforcement powers in that context. We report and publish our findings and we escalate risk appropriately. If it is an immediate risk, we will always ensure that it has been addressed because it has been escalated immediately. However, the responsibility of the provider is to give us an action plan outlining what it intends to do. We can re-monitor but we do not have any enforcement powers.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">I am going to dig a little bit deeper in behind that question. HIQA is a monitoring group, which gives advice and produces a report. That is my understanding of it. HIQA was in Oberstown. Was either witness part of the inspection?</p>

          <p eId="para_22">Yes, it was an announced inspection. It was quite a settled period. There were 35 children on campus. There had been no major incidents during the period that we were there. We actually noted in our report that there was a very good feel in the units and a good rapport between young people and staff. Obviously, the staff team had been through a very difficult and traumatic time but some of the measures that had been introduced for staff, such as critical incident debriefing, were welcomed by them.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Professors Goldson and Hardwick are referenced in the report. How does what they were doing and what HIQA does differ? Their purpose, according to the report, was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice, to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards. Is that not what HIQA does?</p>

          <from> Ms Mary Dunnion<recordedTime time="2017-11-28T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">They were a group of professionals who were commissioned by the board of Oberstown to conduct a review, which was independent and based on their expertise in the area. We regulate and monitor against nationally mandated standards. However, we did meet both professors when they were conducting their own review. We fed into that review and indeed, they would have commented - anecdotally - on our findings, which correlated with their own findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The 90-odd recommendations in the report were aligned to many of our recommendations. However, I would nuance that by saying we only saw the recommendations and have not seen the report. Therefore it would be difficult for us to make an assessment of those recommendations without seeing the supporting findings and narrative to the recommendations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">The committee has had some consideration of that issue at hand, because it is the one piece we have not had the opportunity to interrogate although, as Ms Dunnion noted, we have sight of the recommendations. Notwithstanding that, I want to understand HIQA's point of view and if she is comfortable now with the cultural and procedural changes and the improvements that have been articulated by the chairman of the board and the chief executive. They have made a submission to this committee and I am pretty sure that Ms Dunnion has had sight of that submission. Is there anything in that submission that has been stated previously that she would critique in any way?</p>

          <p eId="para_31">In our review and monitoring, we have seen, at a very high level, improvements in Oberstown in the governance structure, training, staff development and support. We identified two major non-compliances and they were in the context of health care and the single separation. They were major issues of non-compliance. We assess any provider on how well they respond to risk. We received a very positive response from Oberstown in the context of our findings. While we have not inspected yet, we will do so in the near future and will review, in the context of that review inspection, the action plans as identified through the committee and to ourselves formally from Oberstown.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">On the single separation issue, which I think HIQA adjudicated on the fact that it was not consistently adhered to by staff or management. Obviously there is a process under way where that is being monitored. What methodology does HIQA use? Does it involve inspectors going in and talking to staff, inspecting the physical facilities and so on? How does it actually work?</p>

          <p eId="para_34">We get a dataset in advance of our inspection in order that we have key information on which we have sought the figures. In respect of single separation, for example, we have the number of children who have experienced single separation and the number of incidents of single separation. When we are going in, we take a sample over a period of time so we may look at individual children and follow them for a number of days in terms of their experiences, whether they have been in single separation or otherwise, and the reasons for it. We look at the application of the policy, the reason it has been there and how it is documented. We ascertain whether we can see that the staff have been making every effort to make sure that children are removed from single separation as quickly as possible, because it is very important to bear in mind that single separation is to be a response as a result of extreme risk. It should be an unusual intervention that is used by the staff team.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_35">What criteria do HIQA apply? Presumably, it will use best international practice. What is best international practice for the purposes of the HIQA inspections? HIQA refers to how the authorisations for the approval of the use of single separation and the extension to the time spent in single separation were not always completed by managers in line with policy. One can overcome that by documenting, time keeping and so on, but one must see the justification in the first instance for single separation. As HIQA obviously has regard to best international practice, can Ms Boyle enlighten us as to what best international practice is?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_23">
          <from> Ms Eva Boyle<recordedTime time="2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_36">We look at a number of basic things. The concept of restrictive practice is well known and restrictive practices are where a child's movement is impeded. Naturally the young people in Oberstown are there by order of the courts or are there on remand, so their movement has been restricted anyway. It could be medication that is prescribed, if it is a medical restrictive practice or it could be the environment that is restricted.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">That is the case in single separation where the door is locked. Best international practice shows that restrictive practices should apply for the shortest possible time, should be continuously reviewed and every effort should be made to avoid them. When considering the issue of single separation and restrictive practices we must also bear in mind the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the need to provide for very basic human rights, for example, the rights to fresh air and reading material. </p>

          <p eId="para_38">The measure of success for those who read the report and examine the Oberstown campus will be evidence of cultural change. I perceive that cultural change is taking place in Oberstown and that it is moving towards a more positive disposition with regard to tackling these issues from a staffing point of view. I also perceive that internal communications have dramatically improved. Are my perceptions correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I first visited Oberstown in 2014. I saw change when I visited again this year and, while the process has not been completed, I certainly saw progress on many fronts. In terms of the development of policy initiatives and completing research about the profile of young people, this gives a greater understanding of what children need in terms of placement planning. While these are works in progress, I have certainly seen an improvement.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I do not necessarily expect Ms Boyle to comment on my concluding remarks. If there are real time improvements across all the HIQA standards, it will be necessary for members to see a copy of the Goldson and Hardwick report. It is not enough that we have the recommendations without seeing what is in the body of the report. While I understand that legal issues may arise in respect of the report, if the improvements are taking place in real time, I do not see any reason the committee cannot have regard to the report. We need to have a greater interrogation of the Goldson and Hardwick report. That may not be the correct name but those are the names of the report's authors. We need to see what is in the report because it is a missing piece of the jigsaw. I have no further questions and I thank Ms Boyle for her time.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">Single separation in Oberstown refers to a child who may be in his or her bedroom, in a locked room on his or her own and staff speak to him or her about the incident that gave rise to his or her separation. Staff encourage the child to discuss why he or she acted in a particular and offer a solution. Staff may decide to move the child from his or her bedroom to a general purpose room where there may be an activity and, initially, the child would interact with staff. The child may go back to his or her room again, depending on how the interaction went. Staff may decide to move the child again after a period of observation and talking to the child. Staff may decide to allow the child to mix with another child. It would mean there would be another child mixing with the child who has remained in his or her bedroom for single separation. Depending on how that goes, staff may decide to allow the child to return to the group. We have see instances where children, prior to being with their group or allowed to mix with another child, have gone to the yard outside for fresh air before returning to their bedroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> A protection room is used in more extreme situations. We have seen a reduction in the use of the protection room. The room is specially designed for single separation. It literally would not have a bed but a mattress may be put in for a child. </p>

What resources and measures were put in place to prevent it happening even into half of that day, the rest of that day, not to mind going all the way to day eight before we managed to get fresh air? Where are the witnesses going to go from here? Do they plan to have an unannounced visit in the next three months? Where does an alarm go off here that this could be a continual practice? Ms Boyle is saying that there was a good atmosphere so I am taking it that things are moving on.

          <p eId="para_82">Deputy Rabbitte is correct. The provision of the service and the accountability for that service rests with the management of Oberstown. Regarding the data that we reviewed that brought up this case, the action plan delivered from Oberstown would be to show adherence to the policy, monitoring of the policy, training staff in the policy and in its application. When we conduct our unannounced inspection, or announced because we can do either, it will be reviewing the data to show what has been happening. If there is a child in that position when we are there we will review the case itself. However, it is looking at the data and ensuring that there is not a repeat of what we published as a major non-compliance in the context of single separation.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">Thank you Deputy Rabbitte. I have a few questions myself. I visited Oberstown shortly after I was appointed Chairman of the committee. I should have done so long before because it is in my constituency. Having visited the facility for quite a number of hours there were a number of observations that I made in line with the witnesses' report. I visited before I read the report. I found it alarming that the State would invest such significant sums of money in a facility without adhering to the basic principles in other detention facilities albeit I accept entirely that we are talking about juveniles. However, the basic principles are the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> One was fire safety. That was very clear and made very obvious to me when visiting. At the back of the building one passes a fire door with a notice that it is blocked closed. I am not sure 4 x 4 would justify how large this piece of wood was jamming it closed because the security on the door was compromised. Other basic principles like door sizes, frame sizes being all completely different, and locking systems being similar in my observation to domestic residences. I know from that visit that Oberstown management were pleased that they had co-operation from the Irish Prison Service in the provision of their locks. However, the fact that the State had expended so much money on a facility, and multiple elements within the same facility, without doing the basic research to me was not just shocking. I have no idea what they were thinking. I found that appalling not just that the witnesses had to go out and highlight the obvious. </p>
          <p eId="para_86">The staff were put in a position whereby they could not guarantee the integrity of the building in which certain juveniles were being detained and-or assessed. That was an observation I wanted to get off my chest since I visited the facility some months ago. </p>
          <p eId="para_87"> My main question concerns the positives the witnesses have highlighted in the report in term of the response from staff and management in Oberstown. It is very clear, having visited the centre and seen, for example, the profiling research which has been completed or is underway, that the basic responses which are being implemented on foot of the report are positive. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Unfortunately, there are number of themes which I am aware the witnesses have been assessing for many years. Ms Boyle referred to it being a learning curve, but elements have been left unaddressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I refer to health, which is listed as an area of major non-compliance. I do not have a specific question because the report clearly highlights some of the issues. Can the witnesses tell me the most alarming elements and responses to them from Oberstown management in terms of the resolution to the highlighted sections?</p>

          <p eId="para_90">We issued an immediate action plan in respect of health while we were physically present for an inspection. That centred on a child who required a particular medication for an allergy, which staff had not been trained to administer. In fairness, immediate action was taken and staff were trained. A nurse gave a briefing to staff and staff on shift were trained, who then trained other staff to ensure the intervention would be put in place if required.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> The second immediate action concerned the safe storage of medication. We found keys left in a medication cabinet and there was concern that a child or young person could gain access to medication. We were satisfied with the response, which ensured that keys were locked away and held securely. The problem was dealt with on the day. </p>
          <p eId="para_92"> In respect of other areas of concern in terms of health, we were concerned that some children experienced a delay in receiving medical attention and gave two examples in the report. One child was delayed in getting an X-ray for security reasons. That was of concern to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> The campus management team have put in place a process whereby if there is a concern about a child requiring medical attention, such as security concerns, the matter goes to the level of chief operations officer who needs to look at arrangements which can be put in place in order for a child to access and receive appropriate medical attention. </p>

          <p eId="para_94">In terms of the reaction time and the number of individuals on the date of the inspection, who had knowledge of the matter to which Ms Boyle referred, did the report highlight that no members of staff were trained or were there only medical personnel on site?</p>

          <p eId="para_95">The reality is that nursing staff are on site. However, those staff were not available within the unit on a 24-hour basis. It was important that social care and residential care staff had the knowledge to administer that medication.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I remember reading it and thinking it was very peculiar thing to have in a HIQA report, but of course I recognise its relevance to fire safety. In regard to the overall process of implementation of the recommendations within the report, the witnesses mentioned that there will be areas where the facility will be compliant. Since this report was written and any follow-ups completed, are there any particular areas to which the witnesses believe more attention should be given?</p>

          <p eId="para_111">Some of the actions are due to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, so they have until the end of year to complete them. We received an updated action plan at the end of October, and we sought some clarification on particular issues in November. As we have mentioned, the issue of the fire door will continue into next year. Obviously, our preference would be for that to be completed within the calendar year, but we have been given reasons that was not possible. However, it is making progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">No. We speak to the school principal, and we certainly look at education within the context of young people's care planning. Children speak very highly of the school, as do their parents. It is a very positive experience for young people. However, we do not inspect it from an educational point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">That does not concern HIQA. To the witnesses' knowledge, does the Department of Education and Skills implement the same level and standards of inspection that HIQA does, given that the school is in a detention facility?</p>

          <p eId="para_120">That is fine. Many of these young people are within the school's four walls under different circumstances, but similar issues may arise because of different inspection standards. I do not refer to the educational standards, I might add. That is perhaps a matter for me to raise with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">We looked at a number of issues, the first of which was supervision. There is a supervision policy within the Oberstown centre. Supervision is a two-way process. It is about the manager ensuring the worker is doing his or her work, but it is also about having an opportunity for that staff member to have a one-to-one with his or her manager to discuss how he or she is progressing within his or her working environment and the direct work he or she is doing with children. There is a supportive as well as a supervisory element to the process, which was something we highlighted. We felt there was a need for regular supervision and clear records on the agreed outcomes as a result of the process. However, we also saw that a critical incident debriefing process had been introduced on the campus. That was a very positive move which allowed staff some time out after a difficult incident to review and talk about what had worked well and what had not and how they felt about it emotionally. That was a new initiative, which was positive. There are also other staff supports available through the human resources department.</p>

In that context, an increase in resources for our children's team would certainly benefit the safety and welfare of children in the care of the State. We have obviously made applications in that regard.</p>
