#SeanSherlock	Labour	16220	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	0	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." The purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the use of micro-plastics, particularly for particles that are less than 5 mm in diameter. Micro-plastics are used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products such as scrubs, soaps, lotions and toothpastes. They are added to these products to make the product more abrasive or for decoration. These particles of plastic enter the environment when consumers rinse them down the drain. The plastics are not caught in water treatment systems and, instead, are subsequently released into rivers and the sea with wastewater outflows. Micro-plastics are an entirely unnecessary source of micro-plastic pollution and are likely to have environmental impacts. Studies have shown they can be ingested by marine animals, leading to physical harm and reproductive or toxic effects. There is evidence to suggest that they are entering the human food chain, although micro-plastics in seafood are not currently thought to represent a human health risk. Micro-plastic debris in marine environments is growing in volume. It comes from a number of sources apart from cosmetics sources, such as the breakdown of larger pieces of plastic over time and industrial scrubbers used to blast-clean surfaces. A number of companies are voluntarily phasing out some types of micro-plastic in cosmetic products in the EU. In the USA, a ban on micro-beads in cosmetic and personal care products will be phased in over the next few years. A call for a similar ban in the UK has been accepted by the UK Government. In December 2014, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden issued a joint statement to EU environment Ministers calling for an EU ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents. However, a January 2016 research report commissioned by the European Commission, entitled "Study to support the development of measures to combat a range of marine litter sources", looked at what EU mechanisms were available to reduce micro-bead pollution from cosmetics. It concluded that introducing a ban on micro-beads in the EU would be more complicated than the laws “used in the US and Canada”. It said that it was “unclear as to whether any of the [existing] Directives and Regulations” that had been identified “would be suitable”. The option of unilateral action by member states remains. To turn to the detail of the Bill, section 1 provides in standard form for the Short Title of the Bill. Section 2 provides for the prohibition of micro-plastics. It provides that a person who manufactures, sells or exposes, offers, advertises or keeps for sale, or imports or attempts to import into the State for sale any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence."Cosmetic" is defined as "any cosmetic or personal care product including but not limited to a facial scrub, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste". "Micro-plastics" is defined as "plastic particles less than 5 millimetres in diameter". The section provides:(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both,(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.Provision is made for the liability of directors, managers, secretaries etc. of corporate bodies where they consent to or connive in the commission of an offence by the corporate body. The section provides that it is a defence for an accused person to prove that he or she did not know and had no reason to suspect that the cosmetic in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed contained micro-plastics. I wish to acknowledge the role of the Green Party in first raising this matter in the Houses of the Oireachtas and to acknowledge the role of Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who has led the way on this issue. I note that the Minister responded to Senator O'Sullivan in the Seanad while not accepting her Bill on the basis that the Government has said it will put forward its own legislative proposal in this regard. I accept the bona fides of the Minister when he says the Government is committed to legislating on this issue. The Minister said in his speech to the Seanad:I see advantages in Ireland leading by example on microbeads. With this in mind, the Government will develop proposals to ban microbeads nationally in the context of a wider marine environmental Bill to be published [this] year [that is, 2017], which will also provide the legislative basis for a network of marine protected areas [and so on].I suppose the Minister will provide some rebuttal to the Labour Party Bill. The Labour Party Bill seeks to build on the aims of the Green Party Bill. We do not seek to be partisan in any way. We believe this is an issue that affects us all and we hope there is a non-partisan solution. I am hopeful today that we will move to a position whereby our Bill, at least, is accepted and will stay on the Order Paper. Perhaps the Minister will accept our Bill. I doubt that will be the case but I hope we will be able to leave it on the Order Paper at least until such time as the Government comes up with a set of proposals. The Minister will tell us there is an issue of EU law at play here, particularly in respect of the Single Market. The Minister will tell us that Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty have a bearing on whether or not this legislative proposal can bear fruit. We have carefully considered the question on EU law and whether or not that would prevent member states from taking action on the issue. Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union set out the principle that, as the Single Market is an area without internal borders, restrictions on the movement of goods are not allowed and that the free movement of goods should be guaranteed. We accept this. Undoubtedly, an Irish ban on the sale of products containing microbeads would have the effect of restricting certain imports. However, Article 36 of the treaty goes on to state that Articles 34 and 35 do not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports that are justified on grounds of the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants. In other words, the EU treaty directly acknowledges that national measures can be taken to protect the environment. Microbeads, as we know, enter the environment, are not caught in water treatment systems and instead are released into rivers and the sea with wastewater outflows. Micro-plastics are an entirely unnecessary source of pollution and are likely to have environmental impacts. Studies have shown they are ingested by marine animals, leading to physical harm and toxic effects, and there is evidence to suggest they are entering the human food chain. In December 2014, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden issued a joint statement calling for an EU ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents to EU Ministers with responsibility for environmental matters. In January 2016 - I have already referred to this research report - they examined what EU mechanisms were available to reduce microbead pollutants from cosmetics. In light of the hesitancy at EU level, we believe domestic action - that is, action within our own Parliament - is both necessary and appropriate. It is true that our proposed legislation amounts, on the face of it, to a trade barrier, but there is a well-established procedure for dealing with this. The EU transparency directive sets up a procedure obliging the member states to notify the Commission of all draft regulations on products before they are adopted into national law. The notification triggers a standstill period of three months. The Commission and other member states can use this time to examine the notified draft regulation to determine whether it complies with the EU treaty and the principles of free movement of goods and services. If there is no reaction, the draft can be adopted after the three-month standstill period has expired. This is exactly the procedure that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, had to follow when he introduced the ban on smoking in the workplace. There was a standstill period for the new rules and then they came into full force and effect. The European Commission can block the proposal if the draft legislation concerns a matter on which the EU itself proposes to act, but this is clearly not the case at this time regarding micro-plastics. We therefore firmly believe that the option of unilateral action by Ireland on this issue is a valid one under the European Union treaty. It is timely that we would legislate for this very important public health and environmental issue. I am hopeful that the Minister will accept the legislative proposal before the House. I anticipate that he will tell us there will be a Government legislative proposal on this very issue in the not-too-distant future. I am conscious that we have an opportunity here to collaborate now on a non-partisan issue, an issue of what I would call grave concern regarding public health. As I said, I am hopeful that the Minister will accept our bona fides on this and that we can get cross-party support on the issue and I look forward to hearing from the Minister on this matter. If it is the case that the Minister proposes to bring forward his own legislative proposal, I am hopeful that will not be tacked onto or attached to another piece of legislation. I am hopeful it would be a bespoke, stand-alone legislation because I believe Ireland should take leadership on this issue. It is something that affects us all. Again, I note that the Minister has stated he is intent on legislating for this issue. I will quote again from the Minister's speech to the Seanad:There are approximately 6.2 trillion particles of litter in our oceans. That is 1,000 particles for every person on the planet.The Bill is therefore tied in and allied to many other issues related to the marine environment. I stand before the House as a former Minister of State for research and innovation and someone who was committed during the lifetime of the previous Government, along with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, to ensuring taxpayers' money was used in a way that recognised the value of our maritime environment and the potential of that environment to deliver marine renewable energy. We want to see clean oceans and clean seas and, as an island nation, we need to take a global leadership position on this.

I also want to acknowledge the role of Senator Grace O’Sullivan in raising these issues. I share the concerns of both Deputy Sherlock and Senator Grace O’Sullivan and many others from various parties who have spoken in this debate. I share the same vision as the Deputy in the outcome which we want. There are some problems with the legislation he is proposing. Having spoken to him earlier, I propose that the Government will not oppose this legislation but I want to signal clearly that the Government will bring forward its own legislation and I will outline why that is necessary. I gave a signal that we would legislate for this but could not support the legislation proposed in the Seanad. It is important to recognise that by not opposing this legislation, we will probably abstain and, hopefully, allow it to proceed on the understanding that if and when we produce the Government’s legislative response to this, whether in the foreshore Bill or in a separate piece of legislation, after the work that needs to be done first, that Deputy Sherlock will work with us to get the job done and make sure that it is a robust response to what most of us want, which is to ban the production and use of microbeads and micro-plastics where appropriate because it is a significant contributor to marine litter and is unjustifiable and unnecessary. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I gave a commitment in the Seanad last November to legislate to prohibit the sale and manufacture of certain products containing microbeads, including cosmetics, body care and cleansing products and detergents and abrasive surface cleaning products. This is a much wider scope than envisaged by the Bill the Deputy proposes. It is intended to include these provisions in legislation which will also provide the legislative basis for a network of marine protected areas as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and make necessary amendments to the Dumping at Sea Acts. At that time, I committed to writing to Commissioner Vella to inform him we would be drawing up such legislation and that we would be seeking a formal derogation from EU market rules in order to do this. This letter has been sent and Commissioner Vella has responded. My officials are currently working on this legislation. Any legislation relating to microbead prohibition will stand or fall on the strength of the definitions of microbeads, plastics and the identification of the ranges of products to be covered by the legislation. At this time, there is much highly technical debate nationally and internationally as to how exactly to define microbeads and also what constitutes plastic. My Department is working both with national experts and has consulted with international experts to help us develop a water-tight and workable definition to reduce, as far as practicable, the possibility of unintended consequences and to ensure that our legislation is comprehensive, robust and future-proofed for the purposes of a robust and future-proofed marine environmental programme. Departmental officials have met with the OSPAR Commission, EU member states, including the UK, Germany and Belgium, with NGOs, such as Seas at Risk, and with industry representatives, such as Plastics Europe and Cosmetics Europe, and are examining other technical approaches being undertaken internationally by the USA, Canada, the UK and France on this matter. The Department is trying to provide a comprehensive response. What is emerging is that there is little consensus on the definition of microbeads and the definition of "plastic" is also an issue, so whatever legislation is put in place will require very considered work with technical expert input on its definitions to ensure it is fit for purpose, including such matters as the important difference between the technical terms “microbeads” and “micro-plastics". Otherwise, any legislation brought forward could have a myriad of unintended consequences. I have no doubt that the Deputy can understand my concern about these definitions. It is also important the scope of the legislation relates to products where there is an identified pathway by which microbeads contained in them may enter rivers or other marine environments. At this time, the only clearly identified pathway relates to products that are rinse-off. The microbeads they contain are washed into wastewater systems and may reach the environment through them. Not all cosmetic products containing microbeads are considered as having such pathways at this time. Given the scale of the technical work involved, and the importance of achieving the correct outcomes, I consider the Bill before the House to be somewhat problematic but it is a signal of intent that this House should allow it to proceed, which is what my party intends to do. In particular, the definitions contained in the Bill are not adequate or appropriate for legislation of this type and no provision is made for powers of investigation or enforcement, which would make the proposed approach unworkable and unenforceable. We can amend that. I am not saying we are ruling these things out but the legislation we bring forward will be a big improvement. Most importantly, it is my belief, based on preliminary legal advice, that the enactment of this Bill would place Ireland in breach of Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU, which relates to the principle of free movement of goods, and Directive (EU) 2015/1535, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services. The EU’s analysis, consultation and notification requirements of member states which wish to seek an exception to this principle on environmental grounds have not been met yet. European Court of Justice rulings and Commission guidance place a burden of proof on member states to justify any restriction on the free movement of goods. They require that a proper formal justification be made with evidentiary support rather than simply informing the Commission. We are in the process of putting together a very strong case around that justification. Indeed, Commissioner Vella in his response to my letter specifically stated that he looks forward to seeing Ireland's evidence justifying such a ban. In my experience, Commissioner Vella is passionate about marine litter and micro-plastics. I do not believe we will get resistance from him but he will insist on our being legally consistent with the requirements as set out in the treaties. Commmissioner Vella is almost on a personal crusade to establish a much more comprehensive response to marine litter and that is why I think the Commission will help but we need to do this properly. I recently undertook a public consultation process in regard to the legislation I am drawing up to prohibit the manufacture and sale of certain products which contain microbeads. I was impressed by the volume of over 3,000 submissions received in the process which my officials are currently assessing. This follows on from the useful debate in the Seanad last November, and I am sure the debate in this House will add to the evolving policy. Following this public consultation process, further dialogue with stakeholders and experts will be necessary in advance of our lodging of our justification for a derogation under Single Market rules and formally notifying the EU Commission of our intentions, as required. However, the results of the public consultation will streamline this dialogue which I hope will advance quickly. I wish to reassure the House that both I, as the Minister responsible for the marine environmental protection, and the Government generally, recognise that microbeads used in cosmetics, body care products generally, and also other products, such as detergents and scouring agents, are potentially harmful to our rivers, transitional marine areas and marine environments at sea. Indeed, Ireland holds a formal position that we wish to see microbeads banned throughout the European Union.Even though we are working on our own national legislation, I intend to continue to actively campaign for an EU-wide ban on microbeads and work collaboratively with the European Commission and other member states to achieve it. Earlier this week I responded positively to a request from the Swedish Minister for the Environment to join a commitment by a number of countries to ban microbeads.  In recent years, scientists, experts and policy makers have become increasingly concerned about the levels of waste, or marine litter, ending up in the seas. Deputy Sean Sherlock has mentioned that there are over 6 trillion plastic particles in the seas, which is an extraordinary number. The weight of the combined marine litter across the oceans is staggering. It equates to there being an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean as big as some countries. It is a huge issue, in respect of which, as an island nation surrounded by a very important marine environment, we have a moral obligation to do a lot more. As Deputies are aware, it can be found in every aspect of the marine environment and ranges in size from large objects such as fishing nets or shipping containers to micro and nano-litter particles, that is, particles smaller than 1 mm in diameter. However, the extent of the marine litter problem and the harm it causes to the environment is not yet fully understood and subject to ongoing extensive research. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that it is an issue we need to address in a much more comprehensive way than we have in the past. We should take a precautionary approach in terms of how we approach it from a policy perspective. Marine litter also causes socioeconomic harm. It affects tourism and consumer confidence in seafood. More importantly, it affects the marine ecosystems that we have a responsibility to protect into the future. Plastic is a particular problem for the marine environment. Owing to its buoyancy, it can be easily washed down rivers, blown offshore or collected by the tide from the shore, as well as being dumped or lost directly into the seas from ships and fishing boats. It does not biodegrade and persists in the environment for a very long time. It can break down into secondary micro-plastic particles through erosion and there is evidence to suggest both large plastic items and micro-plastics are being ingested by marine fauna, with undetermined consequences for them and creatures higher up the food chain who eat them, including ourselves. While much of the marine micro-plastic litter is created through the erosion of larger pieces, micro-plastics are also entering the marine environment in other forms such as micro-fibres from artificial materials that come off clothes by washing, for example. However, a certain amount of marine micro-plastic litter is caused by plastic microbeads which are used in cosmetics, including body care products, cleansing products and detergents and surface cleaning agents entering the marine environment via wastewater discharges into rivers and estuaries. Such microbeads cannot be easily removed by the treatment of wastewater.  While I acknowledge that microbeads represent a fraction of the micro-plastic litter entering the marine environment, they are a particularly pernicious product as they are ready-made micro-plastics and cannot be removed once they reach the marine environment. Microbeads could not be regarded as a major human necessity. They are often present merely for decorative purposes. Also, where microbeads are used as exfoliating or scouring agents, a wide array of established safe and biodegradable organic particles or natural mineral alternatives are readily available. The relevant industries are fully aware that the tide of international opinion is turning against the use of microbeads on account of their potential to cause harm to marine ecosystems. They are already banned in Canada and the United States. The UK and French prohibitions are due to come into effect later this year and I hope a prohibition will come into effect here too. A number of other EU member states, of which Ireland is one, have formally stated they will seek a similar microbeads prohibition across the European Union. Thus, industry is already turning to other alternatives. Research on the harm caused by marine litter is at an early stage of development. My Department is actively participating in studies both at national and international level to identity the level of waste in the marine environment, the harm it does and what we can do about it. It will advance the science knowledge base in this area and inform future public policy on the matter.

In addition, my Department invests significant resources in world-leading citizen activation and awareness raising programmes such as Clean Coasts and related programmes, as well as the green schools marine environment module which has been developed recently. We will continue to attempt to have a positive influence on societal behaviour on matters concerning the marine environment. We intend to address this issue, but we must ensure we do so properly. There are rules with which we must be consistent, including legislation and EU treaties. What I do not want to do is rush this, only to have it challenged in the courts by the industry and thus delayed for months or years. I am with Deputies on this issue. I recognise, in particular, the role played by the Green Party and the Labour Party in pushing this agenda. We are responding and propose to introduce comprehensive legislation to deal with the issue, either by way of a Committee Stage amendment to the Foreshore Act or in separate legislation. We will do whatever is appropriate. The new foreshore legislation which should be published in June will present an obvious opportunity to do that. Deputies are aware of the Seafest seminar which will take place in Galway later in the summer, by which time we will have the new foreshore legislation published. It will be a useful vehicle, from a legislative point of view, to address the matter properly. However, there is further research to be carried out before we can do that.

Fianna Fáil wholeheartedly supports the principle behind the Bill, which is to address a significant source of pollution and environmental degradation. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Sean Sherlock and the Labour Party on the issue, as well as of the Green Party, with reference to the Bill recently brought before the Seanad by Senator Grace O'Sullivan. Fianna Fáil will, however, be abstaining in the vote on the Bill as it is too narrow and fails to address the issue adequately. It has prepared its own Bill which is working its way through the Bills Office and is to be published shortly. It will seek to adopt a more comprehensive and thorough approach to address plastic pollution. This legislation addresses one category of microbeads, namely, those found in cosmetic products. However, despite the motivations of Deputy Sean Sherlock, it overlooks the other major source of microbeads - household cleaning products. The Deputy may have chosen not to address that source because of the complexities involved in dealing with certain aspects of the industry, which I understand. I support what the Minister has promised to do. I hope the Bill which Fianna Fáil hopes to publish shortly will be of further assistance to the Minister in his thinking on this issue. As a result of the omission of household cleaning products from the Bill, millions of microbeads would continue to enter rivers and seas. We need to address the issue comprehensively. Microbeads from cleaning products have the same impact on the environment and marine life as microbeads from cosmetic products, possibly a greater impact when everything is taken into account. This is an important issue that must be addressed. Furthermore, the Bill would do nothing to address other forms of plastic pollution such as that stemming from single-use tableware. While much of this plastic which ultimately ends up in the sea is reduced and broken down over time, it has the same harmful effects as microbeads.While it would never be possible to address all forms of environmental degradation at the same time, we need to use a joined-up approach when it comes to addressing environmental issues. What the Minister is offering here gives me confidence that this will ultimately be the case if the Minister takes into account the work of the Green Party and the Labour Party and the work we have undertaken. Hopefully, we can achieve a consensus at a later stage. I am not entirely concerned about where the legislation ultimately resides. I would advise against having it as a section of the foreshore area the Minister is talking about. We need to make a very clear statement here. It does warrant a stand-alone Bill. I am not entirely concerned about what it is called but if it addresses the primary issue we are talking about, particularly pollution from microbeads regardless of the products or the area from which they emanate, and also looks at additional plastics that have the same harmful effect on sea life, it will certainly get our support.  In addition to microbeads, many waterways and bodies of water in Ireland are blighted by so-called "micro-plastics", which are eroded pieces of other plastic materials. While they do not start out as microbeads, the impact on marine life is exactly the same. This Bill does not seek to look at that. Another area we have worked on looks at a ban on certain disposable tableware, particularly tableware that has an alternative in other biodegradable products. Those of us who walk and use roadways and parkways as a leisure pursuit are all too keenly aware of the way our roadsides are active dumping grounds for non-biodegradable material, specifically plastic material, from fast food outlets. Unfortunately, in many cases, this material finds its way into waterways and rivers and has the same effect.  Microbeads have a very significant impact on the environment. The term "microbead" is used to refer to small spherical-shaped micro-plastics in cosmetic and personal care products. They are used as an abrasive in rinse-off products such as facial scrubs, soaps and toothpastes. While they were initially made of natural materials, microbeads are now typically made of plastics. While they started out as natural products, the active agent is now a plastic. Given that one person using microbeads in a facial or body scrub can wash in the region of between 5,000 and 10,000 beads down the sink, one can imagine how many can end up in the sea or rivers. Washed down the drain, microbeads make their way into rivers and seas. It is estimated that about 2,400 to 8,400 tonnes of plastics enter the marine environment in Europe every year. That is a phenomenal amount of plastics finding their way into our waterways. When one considers that this is happening on an exponential level year after year, one can come to understand the impact it is having on marine life. This type of pollution can have a hugely detrimental impact on marine life. While it has an impact on our shoreline, because of the nature of currents, plastics coming from Ireland have an impact on a much wider field. Microbeads present a huge issue for all forms of marine life, which accidentally ingests them leading to a very significant impact on it and the wider marine environment.  As one can imagine, ingesting large quantities of plastic is extremely harmful to fish and other marine life and the ingestion of microbeads by fish and other sea creatures can poison them and also impact on their movement, breeding and growth potential. According to Ireland's leading marine biologists, microbeads are already negatively impacting on marine life in Ireland. Ireland's marine life is essential to us. Fishing and related activities are central to our lives and economy. The fishing industry provides about 11,000 jobs in Ireland and contributes hundreds of millions of euro to the Irish economy. This does not even account for related activities, such as tourism spending by anglers from overseas. Given that humans may consume fish that have ingested microbeads, microbeads can also have a negative impact on human health. This is often lost in the debate and because our rivers and seas have been fertile for generations, they are seen as appropriate places for dumping. In many cases, people do not seem to understand the cycle of the sea and the impact it has on human life. This can pose a serious health risk. Microbeads contain plastics and toxins that are not recommended for consumption and their mechanical effects on the human body are unknown While we entirely support the principle of the Bill, we believe it does not take a sufficiently comprehensive approach to the issue of microbeads and waterways pollution. First, the Bill accounts for only a narrow portion of microbeads. Given that it only concentrates on cosmetic and personal care products containing microbeads, such as facial washes, toothpastes, make-up, etc., other products containing microbeads will continue to pollute our waterways and seas. For example, what about household cleaning products which contain microbeads? We can all acknowledge that microbeads are immensely damaging and undesirable so what is the point in only half-heartedly banning them? While I understand what the Deputy is saying, I hope the approach we take at a later stage will have a much more beneficial effect. If we ban cosmetic products containing microbeads but not cleaning products, this loophole will continue to allow thousands of microbeads to pollute our water. I was very much taken by Deputy Sherlock's statement that he sees this Bill as a contribution, and a very significant one, to the overall legislative framework that will, hopefully, come to pass and deal with this issue. In doing so, one would recognise the role of the Labour Party. I will be publishing a Bill shortly and it is my intention that our Bill will add further to that. Hopefully, we will receive the same support and recognition.  I am a little confused about the Department in which this resides. I note that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has taken the Bill. It was my understanding that this was an issue for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment but I am open to clarification on that. I know that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will also have a role. I do not want the Bill to fall between the cracks or crevices of the Departments. We already have an issue around the roll-out of broadband and whether this resides in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. In respect of the post office network, there were some issues about one Minister throwing in the towel and the other accepting the challenge and that was played out on the airways. I would like clarification from the Government about whether it is treating this as an environmental issue, whether it is being connected to planning and housing, something I would have difficulty understanding, or whether it is part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which, in my view, it should not be. It should reside with the area of waste, which I understand is in another Department, but I will take clarification on that

I commend Deputy Sherlock for bringing the Bill forward. I also want to mention Senator Grace O'Sullivan who brought forward a Bill in the Seanad in October. Unfortunately, this latter Bill was defeated. I welcome the news from the Government and Fianna Fáil that they will abstain so, hopefully, this Bill will have the numbers to go forward to another Stage. We are supporting the Bill because we believe it is an initiative that will reduce the huge amount of plastic entering our oceans. Microbeads are so small they cannot be filtered out during water treatment and end up in our rivers and oceans. These tiny pieces of plastic are then eaten by marine life and can end up in the food chain. Their effects on human health are still not known but it does not take a scientist to recognise that their effect would not be positive. It is estimated that if someone eats six oysters, it is likely that they will have eaten 50 particles of micro-plastics. The Environmental Audit Committee in the UK, which examined microbeads, heard that each shower taken using products containing microbeads can result in 100,000 pieces of plastic entering the ocean.Micro-plastics from cosmetic products are estimated to constitute up to 4.1% of the total micro-plastics entering the marine environment. The fact that this accounts for a small percentage of total micro-plastic pollution in the sea does not stop it being significant, as it is an avoidable environmental problem. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil's rejection of the previous Bill brought forward by the Green Party in November 2016 in the Seanad was disappointing. There is no reason this area should not be legislated for, as other countries have already introduced similar legislation. This is a growing international trend in this area and Ireland should not be left behind this progressive move towards removing these harmful pieces of plastic that cannot degrade in the environment. In December 2015, then US President Obama signed the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 to phase out the use of micro-plastics in personal care products. In Canada, microbeads have been added to its list of toxic substances and, in the UK, the government announced plans to ban micro-beads in cosmetic products also. The ban is also attractive as it would not have a major impact on industry, as alternatives exist to replace microbeads. Many cosmetic companies have already begun voluntary removal of the plastic. Evidence given to the UK environment committee outlined alternatives, such as ground walnut shells, cocoa beans, ground almonds, ground apricot pits, sea salt and silica. In rejecting the previous Green Party Bill on this issue, European rules on the free movement of goods were cited as a possible obstacle in legislating in this area. This has proven to be totally false, as the UK has received approval from the European Commission stating that a ban on certain substances on environmental grounds could also be compatible with the Internal Market. My colleague in the European parliament, Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, who has been working on this and related issues, has been critical of the overall Government response to the issue. Reflecting on the failure to act on this in a national manner and to look to Europe to take a line they can hide behind, she stated that Irish Governments were as usual trying to export their excuses for inaction to Europe when the simple truth is that they do not want to take any action. Ms Boylan stated:If the government had bothered to do their homework, they would know that the European Commission has already said to the British government as recently as August that it can proceed to introduce a ban on micro-beads, explicitly stating that "a ban on certain substances on environmental grounds could also be compatible with the internal market". ... On top of this, France has already passed a law that will ban the sale of exfoliating cosmetic products containing solid waste particles from January 2018 whilst Sweden and Denmark are also in the process of preparing to move on this issue as well.The Minister, Deputy Coveney, made some interesting comments. I hope he will act on what he said soon and not kick the can down the road. I support this Bill, as I stated earlier, but I also want to register a concern my party has on a small part of the Bill. Section 2(1)(b) states that a person who "sells, or exposes, offers, advertises, or keeps for sale," any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence. The inclusion of "advertises" would pose problems, as how would this be adequately policed? Due to the global nature of advertising, legal compliance with this would be a huge problem for many companies. Prohibiting the sale and importation of cosmetics containing microbeads should suffice and I am not sure whether the inclusion of advertises would be realistic, but we can talk about that when the Bill goes to Committee. Hopefully, it will go through to Committee. Sinn Féin very much welcomes the Bill. It provides a simple solution to an avoidable environment problem. It will not have a major impact on the cosmetic industry as alternatives are available. Sinn Féin is happy to support this piece of legislation. It is estimated that between 15 trillion and 51 trillion micro-plastic particles have accumulated in the ocean, with between 80,000 and 219,000 tonnes of micro-plastics entering the sea from Europe every year. The quicker this is addressed, the better. Ireland should be included in the group of countries leading from the front on the problem. I commend Deputy Sherlock for bringing this forward and the Green Party for trying to do that in the past.

Gone are the days when one could wash things down the sink and hope that they disappear without any consequences. Gone are the days when one could pump out pollution into the atmosphere and hope that it disappears in outer space without any consequences. Gone are the days where one could produce tonnes of waste and hope that it would be taken away on the back of a truck to God knows where. Everything we do has consequences. I compliment Deputy Seán Sherlock for bringing forward this Bill. On the product we are talking about here, we are dealing with a problem that we should not have to deal with. It is totally avoidable. These micro-plastics are being put into everyday products, such as soaps, gels, cosmetics, deodorant and toothpaste. It is basically to glamorise products in what is the most profitable sector of the lot, but what is the end result from this waste? It is having a detrimental effect on our environment, particularly our waters and fish life. Tens of thousands of them go into the waste stream and thousands of tonnes of it into the oceans. It is a product that is consumed by fish, particularly shellfish. It is reported in some areas that up to a quarter of fish contain these plastics. If this was not bad enough, we must remember that these microplastics can then enter the human food chain. If we are not too concerned about fish, we should start thinking about human beings. The UN has reported that it is a growing threat to human health, causing physical damage and having a toxic effect and, among other things, causing reproductive problems. We must remember that, behind the potential damage to human and wildlife health, the logic of the inclusion of this product is simply as a supposed beauty enhancer. Everybody is supposed to look like they do in Hollywood, but, of course, we can just be ourselves. America, strangely enough, has been phasing out this product since July of last year. In Canada, microbeads have been added to the list of toxic substances since June 2016. In Tory Britain, there was the announcement of plans to ban microbeads in cosmetics and personal care products by 2017. There is a growing number of countries that want to ban them. Holland, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden all have called for an EU-wide ban. This is about protection of the environment around us to enhance and project our green image. There is the question about Ireland. Ireland should be taking a lead here. We go on a lot about our green image and how environmentally friendly we are. There are areas such as this where we can lead out and be ahead of the curve, but we are actually behind the curve. We are not yet even off the starting blocks. As my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, has referred to, there was a Bill from the Green Party which the Government opposed. We should be well ahead with this. It is a pity the Green Party Bill was not supported at the time. The Bill we have here is clear at any rate and if there are problems with it, we can amend it on Committee Stage. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, launched a public consultation process on the prohibition, sale, and manufacturing or importing of products such as microbeads. As with so many other matters, it is merely consultation. We know this is harmful. It is unnecessary. What is the point in it? All one has to do is leave it on the supermarket shelves. That is what I started doing since I became aware of this problem. Like many others, up to a couple of years ago I was picking it up, then I twigged when I read an article about it that this was harmful and now I leave it on the supermarket shelf. It is harmful, totally unnecessary and we should take action on it. This House has it within its powers to do that. We should not wait for the EU. We should not wait for any other country. We should start here, protect fish life, protect our environment and protect human health. We are supporting the Bill.

I welcome this Bill and warmly commend Deputy Sherlock for bringing it before the House. The Green Party will, of course, be wholeheartedly supporting it. As many Members have said, the issue of microbead and micro-plastic pollution was first raised in the Oireachtas by my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, in the Seanad last November . The Senator brought before the Seanad a Bill which Deputy Sherlock's Labour colleagues in the Seanad were vocal in supporting, along with Sinn Féin and many Independents, including Senator O'Sullivan's colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group. Regrettably, however, the Government and Fianna Fáil, instead of progressing the Bill and looking to amend it at a later Stage, declined to give the Bill a Second Reading. I appreciate that the Minister has since taken steps on this issue, including having facilitated an extensive public consultation process and committed to notify the EU Commission and World Trade Organization formally of the State's intention to introduce a ban. These are positive steps, and this Bill is another positive step and one which the Green Party believes should be fully supported by this House. The Labour Party’s Bill seeks to do many of the things the Green Party's Bill sought to do. I welcome its introduction in this House and hope that it will see better fortune than our Bill did last November. The attention, focus and conversation which Senator Grace O’Sullivan started in her capacity as a legislator should not be underestimated and it clearly was an effective catalyst. It has always been the Green Party’s view that to make long-term successful inroads in a multifaceted approach to protecting the environment, it requires the active support of the majority of political parties and the same applies globally. No one political party has ownership of environmental issues, but for as long as that is the perception, the environment and, ultimately, the people will lose. That is why we must work together and this Bill presents an opportunity to do so. However, I would like to see provisions in this Bill for the monitoring of microbeads and micro-plastics by the Environmental Protection Agency, and for a differentiation to be drawn between microbeads and micro-plastics. Both of these provisions were present in Senator Grace O’Sullivan’s Bill and their inclusion would greatly strengthen Deputy Sherlock’s Bill. Deputy Eamon Ryan and I intend to bring forward amendments to that effect on Committee Stage. The arguments for the ban on microbeads have been outlined by Senator Grace O’Sullivan in the Seanad, and again by Deputy Sherlock and others today in this House, so I need not restate them. The central purpose of the Green Party moving its Bill in the Seanad, and the value of this conversation around microbeads and micro-plastics in the first place, was to highlight the much larger issue of plastic marine litter in general. Microbeads are just the tip of the iceberg. Some 150 million tonnes of plastics have accumulated in the world’s oceans and we continue to add up to 12 million tonnes every year. Not alone is this litter causing serious damage to our fish and other marine life but there are also considerable economic losses in tourism and fishing which the European Commission has said is estimated to cost up to €630 million a year for coastal and beach cleaning. This Bill is about the health of our seas. The banning of microbeads and micro-plastics is a first important and beneficial step, but we must be aware of the many other challenges facing us if we are to clean up our seas and sea beds. As an island country it is essential that we are a leading voice in Europe and on the world stage in calling for co-operation and coherent action in tackling marine litter. This is not any one country’s responsibility, but rather it is every country’s responsibility. I call on the Government to make our voice heard loudly and clearly. I urge every Member of this House to support the Bill, and take the first practical step in moving this Bill to the next Stage in order to tackle an aspect of one of the biggest issues facing our seas. With the support of this House, the process of beginning to tackle this problem becomes realistic and achievable.

I also wish to acknowledge the work of various environmental groups, including tidy towns organisations and green schools. School children, both at primary and secondary level, are acutely aware of difficulties arising from pollution. The environmentalist, Robert Swan OBE, said the greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it. I personally do not care who that someone is, once we in this Parliament give a lead in dealing with the wider issues of pollution, which are of great concern to me and all other Members of this House. There are five main ocean gyres created by a large whirlpool caused by currents with plastic floating in them. This is caused by the rotation of the earth known as the Coriolis effect. One such gyre, the North Atlantic garbage patch, is estimated to cover hundreds of kilometres with over 200,000 pieces per square kilometre. This debris zone alone among the five, shifts as much as 1,600 km seasonally. This has been known since 1972. If we compare the earth’s 45 billion year evolution in a 24-hour timeline, we will see that dinosaurs made their appearance at 10.56 p.m., mammals at 11.39 p.m. and humans at 11.58 p.m. That is two minutes to midnight and in that short period of mankind’s arrival and custodianship of the earth we have turned the planet into a rubbish tip. Microbeads were once a must-have ingredient in the pursuit of flawless skin and cleaner surfaces, but have now become a scourge of the environment and are hated by all who care for our planet. The US, Canada and the Netherlands have banned them from cosmetics because of their potential impact on the environment, and the UK is preparing to ban them from the end of this year. A detailed report published by the House of Commons library has warned that any attempt to impose a unilateral ban could break EU free trade laws. The Minister referred to that earlier. It also advises that the proposed legislation could be open to legal challenge by cosmetics companies affected by the ban. However, a large proportion of cosmetic companies are thankfully already switching to natural alternatives. By legislating to ban micro-plastics, more cosmetic and cleaning product manufacturers will hopefully cease to use them. According to the Ocean Clean-up Project, over 5 trillion pieces of plastic currently litter the ocean. A total of 4,360 tonnes of micro-plastic beads were used in 2012 across all European Union countries, plus Norway and Switzerland, according to a survey by Cosmetics Europe. The survey focused on the use of micro-plastic beads, with polyethylene beads representing 93% of the total amount equalling 4,037 tonnes. Plastic ingredients that are poured down the drain after use cannot be collected for recycling, unlike the packaging which can be recycled. Plastic ingredients do not decompose in wastewater treatment systems. The ingredients are emitted via raw sewage, treated effluents or with sewage sludge applied as fertiliser biosolids on agricultural land, as landfill or dumped at sea. This plastic pollution is having a major detrimental effect on marine life, as others have said. Micro-plastics are of huge environmental concern because their size means that they are accessible to a wide range of organisms, including seabirds, fish, mussels, lugworms and zooplankton. Micro-plastic pollution has been a big issue for many years in the marine research field. Recent scientific investigations in Europe have also revealed the presence of micro-plastic residues in freshwater systems, including drinking water and wastewater treatment. The issue of micro-plastics in cosmetics is also coming up on the environmental agenda right across the world. It needs to be dealt with. Micro-plastic particles which are found in personal care products, such as exfoliants or cleansers, are reaching the marine environment via wastewater from consumers' baths and showers at a rapid rate. As Deputy Dooley said, Fianna Fáil wholeheartedly supports the principle of this Bill. Like the Minister, however, we believe it is too narrow and fails to address the issue of plastic microbeads in household cleaning products, as well as other plastic produce such as disposable tableware. We will be introducing our own legislation which will be more comprehensive in its approach to eliminating plastic pollution.The rectification of the anomalies highlighted by the Minister and previous speakers should be speedily facilitated. Other important sources of plastic pollution must also be addressed, including single use tableware. France is leading the way in legislating to stop plastic pollution by introducing a complete ban on disposable plastic dishes, plates and cutlery. While I realise it would not be possible in one Bill to address all forms of plastic pollution, this legislation does not go far enough. The Bill must address other plastic products which break down over time in our oceans and inland waters forming micro-plastics. Much of the litter found in the ocean is from larger plastics eroding to form micro-plastics. The legislation planned by Fianna Fáil will address these issues. We hope to give the Minister power to ban single use tableware and fast food plastic eating containers. These products are too often found littering our streets and countryside and are the scourge of Tidy Towns groups which are making valiant efforts to keep communities clean. As someone who is involved in this area, I note that tinfoil and similar products also cause problems in the environment. Brown Thomas and Arnotts stopped selling products containing micro-plastic beads in August last year and many local shops in towns and villages, encouraged by Tidy Towns organisations, are starting to use biodegradable alternatives. While the European Union is also examining this issue, we must move swiftly by introducing legislation and leading by example, as previous speakers noted. We need to get serious about cleaning up our wastewater systems and setting cleaner, environmentally sound standards. A single shower by a person using a product containing microbeads can result in more than 100,000 of these beads entering the wastewater system. The Dutch have created an app, Beat the Microbead, to combat plastic microbeads. The aim is to achieve grassroots change via the consumer. Launched in 2012, the app is now backed by the United Nations environment programme and is available in seven languages. It enables the consumer to scan a product's barcode to check whether it contains microbeads. The app has proved very popular, convincing a number of large multinationals such as Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and the Body Shop to announce their intent to stop using microbeads. It can be downloaded free of charge and I urge those with a keen interest in this issue to use it.

I also thank other Members who have raised the issue, including Senator Grace O'Sullivan. I only became aware of the problems caused by micro-plastics when I watched the film "Trashed" by Jeremy Irons. I was shocked by the film, which I screened for Deputies and Senators in the House several years ago. It covered the general issue of trash and specifically highlighted the terrifying consequences of dumping rubbish, particularly plastics which break down into micro-plastics, in the oceans. While public awareness of this issue is growing, it is probably not great enough. It is important, therefore, that the House debates the issue, sounds the alarm about it and gets across the message that our oceans are vital for human existence and survival. Approximately 70% of the oxygen we breathe is produced by marine plants, 97% of the earth's water supply is contained in the ocean and 30% of the CO2 emissions produced by humans are absorbed by the oceans. Coastal ecosystems store ten times more carbon than terrestrial forests and the degradation of marine ecosystems accounts for 19% of carbon emissions from global deforestation. Deforestation, in turn, accounts for between 20% and 25% of the impacts of global warming. In poisoning and polluting the oceans, we are destroying the means to sustain human existence.  Against this background, the extent of the damage that has been done is extraordinary. In 2010, some 215 million metric tonnes of plastics found their way into the sea. In 2007, a total of 2.12 billion tonnes of waste was dumped into the planet's oceans. As a result of pollution, a 5,000 sq. m. area in the Gulf of Mexico is almost completely devoid of life and nitrification has completely destroyed the oxygen in the water in 405 similar dead zones in the world's oceans. Plastics, including micro-plastics, make the largest contribution to this problem. We must take urgent action to address these terrifying developments. I welcome the Bill and the call for Ireland to take unilateral action. We should take the lead, rather than waiting around for the European Union to get its act together. We will see whether the confidence the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, expressed in the EU and Commissioner Vella is justified but we should not wait around to find out.  It is important to emphasise, as previous speakers have noted, that microbeads contained in cosmetics account for a very small part of the problem. While their small size means they can get through filters and get into and poison animal and marine life in a particularly pernicious way, studies suggest they are a very small part of the problem. One Norwegian study, for example, showed that of 8,000 tonnes of micro-plastics, as opposed to microbeads alone, produced annually in Norway, half of which end up in the oceans, microbeads accounted for only 0.1%, whereas the tyre industry accounted for 55%, with various other activities, including washing textiles, marine leisure and construction, accounting for the remainder. The Bill would take an important step but there is a much wider problem that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. This must not be used as an excuse for not passing this legislation, however. The argument that more studies are needed or that we must learn more about the issue, of which there was a hint in the Minister's contribution, is not acceptable as it would only delay action in this area. Let us move on those issues on which we can move and do so as urgently as possible.We need to look at and address the wider problem and face down any resistance from corporate interests to legislation and bans on these materials or other measures that need to be taken to prevent the pollution of water sources and oceans by these products, whatever their source. I welcome the Bill and hope the Government will agree to its passage and not delay on it. If the Minister is serious about legislation to cover the wider problem, it has to be brought forward as a matter of urgency. It will also have to be comprehensive in dealing with the multiplicity of sources of rubbish, trash, pollutants, micro-plastics and all the rest from all sorts of industry. It is being dumped into rivers and filtering through the soil, ultimately ending up in the oceans and killing marine life and, as a consequence, potentially killing something that helps to sustain human existence on the planet. I hope these issues can be further highlighted in today's debate.

Immense praise is due to Deputy Sean Sherlock for bringing this matter to the floor of the House. I am stating this publicly because it is something we all need to discuss. In fairness, listening to the debate, we can all come together and formulate a policy on it. I have been watching some of the debate in my office and listening to some of it in the Chamber and a lot of valid points have been made about the damage caused by plastic microbeads. I wish to introduce a few other things.  Deputies have spoken about the problem in our own country, but we probably have all been watching the reports on Sky News on the cleaning up of the oceans by volunteers. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and others also referred to this matter. In dealing with community and Tidy Towns groups, etc. we all know about the scourge of plastics. Such groups constantly bring the matter to our attention. There is another dreadful aspect to the problem - the amount of plastic in the ground that is causing flooding issues and doing a lot of damage. In some parts of my constituency of Roscommon-Galway where we were trying to alleviate the effects of flooding and some drainage and dredging works were carried out the amount of plastic in the ground was shocking. It is something we should encompass in further Bills and discussions we will have on the issue. As has been stated, there are billions of tonnes of plastic in the oceans, lakes and rivers and it is becoming an absolute scourge. There is absolutely no doubt that it is detrimental to the environment and marine life. It is notable that many of the Nordic countries have banned the use of plastic microbeads in recognition of how dangerous they are. We need to move forward with legislation and address the issue in the coming months so as not to push it down the road. We need to take definite decisions. The plastic business employs millions of people throughout the world, but there is no reason it cannot operate and have its place. However, this matter concerns the dumping of much of the material it produces. It is shocking to watch the special reports, particularly on Sky News, on what is happening. We know that it is happening in our own country and can see it everywhere we go. Many lakes and rivers are full of this material which has been dumped into them. Even though we are abstaining in the vote on the Bill, I support what the Deputy is trying to do. It is a very good discussion of an issue we must address. I again thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me a few minutes to express my opinions on it.

I commend my party colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, for tabling this important legislation and allowing us to address what is an important issue. As others have stated, it is not the most important environmental issue with which the House will grapple and the legislation will not bring climate change to an end. However, passing it would be an important incremental step. We will not address the degradation of the environment in one item of legislation. Looking at all of the component parts and the actions of humans that impact adversely on the sustainability of the environment and the future of humans, animals and fauna, taking action incrementally, step by step, is the way forward. This is an issue which has been clearly identified and to which the solution is straightforward. For that reason, there is no discernible argument there should not be consensus across the House, which consensus should migrate into direct action. I also congratulate Senator Grace O'Sullivan who tabled a similar Bill in Seanad Éireann. It is important that we do not let go of these things and that we push and argue until such time as we make a difference. I welcome the contribution of the Minister for Housing, Planing, Community and Local Govenrment because I was a little dismayed when I read the Order Paper and saw that there was amendment to deny the Bill a Second Reading. I am glad the amendment was not moved. I am a tad confused. Since the next speaker is the Minister of State, he might tell me exactly who is responsible for dealing with these issues. The initial critique and rebuttal of the Bill were made by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, who referenced it at the Environment Council in Malta in recent times. Deputy Simon Coveney is not the Minister with responsibility for the environment or the marine. I am not quite sure where the Minister with responsibility for housing comes into it.

Having worked with Deputy Simon Coveney for a number of years, I know about his passion for marine issues. In fact, he put up his hand when I was looking for a volunteer to take on the task of refurbishment of Great Island. A lot of work - €60 million worth - has been done to tackle environmental degradation. However, I do not think someone can, Charlie Haughey-esque, bring his or her pet projects with him or her as he or she marches across Departments. There is a need for clear lines of demarcation. I understand the EPA, which has statutory responsibility in this area, is within the remit of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. A little clarity would be helpful. Nonetheless, having read the commentary of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, I am glad that it is the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is responding to this debate. There are a number of things we need to do. One of the things we could do is take an incremental approach as issues arise. The argument is we cannot act until there is an EU consensus. The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has indicated to the House that both the United Kingdom and France, having notified the European Union of their intention to do so, will be instituting such a ban before the end of the year. He has also indicated that a similar ban will be extant in Ireland by the end of the year. Perhaps that is his objective, but I wonder if it is achievable as we have not seen the legislation. It has been indicated that it might be an addendum to the foreshore Bill which is due to be published next month. The Dáil will go into recess early in July. Will the Bill be, as the Minister indicated, enacted and implemented by the end of the year? I am very interested in hearing specifically what the Minister of State has to say on that point. Deputy Sean Sherlock has been very honest in saying this is a really important issue but that it is part of a suite of issues that need to be addressed. We have all seen the analysis in recent times that, within the foreseeable future, the total weight of plastics in the oceans will be the equivalent of, if not greater than, the total weight of fish and marine life.That is a shocking thought. Remote islands in the Pacific Ocean that are thousands of miles away from significant habitation are subject to massive landfalls of plastics, which are non-degradable and permanent and have an enormous impact on ecosystems, such as the turtles which come onshore to nest and lay their eggs. We really need to have a global response to the problem and I certainly welcome the building of an international consensus within the EU. This does not, however, stop us from taking an initiative and being at the vanguard of change. I hope the Bill, which will now pass Second Stage, will not simply be parked. The Labour Party has no proprietorial claims over the Bill if there are better ways of doing this but it will be overtaken by better legislation or we will seek to bring this Bill forward and have the Government amend Deputy Sherlock's Bill on Committee Stage. Either way, we are setting down a very clear view today that the Labour Party wants these measures enacted, with the objective of ensuring that this form of marine pollution is no longer happening on the island of Ireland. We can do this by taking the unilateral action as set out in the Bill or by working in consort with others but it is important that we do it as early as possible.

I thank Deputy Sean Sherlock for bringing forward the Bill. I hope it is our Department's remit because I spent time in the Seanad dealing with Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill. If it is not my Department, then we are all wasting our time. I am fairly confident it is within our remit. I want to clarify that marine environmental policy rests in our Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. I am conscious that the name of the Department has changed over the years.

I am giving the facts. I agree with Deputies that it is great Deputy Coveney is the Minister. The Minister is charged with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, marine spatial planning and the regulation of the foreshore under the Foreshore Acts. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, also has a range of marine planning and environmental responsibilities, including around the freshwater area. These are from a planning perspective because most of the proposed legislation is planning Bills. This clarifies "the who"; we can tease out "the what" afterwards. The Minister consults the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and his Department because there is a lot of crossover there. We accept that. I understand there is confusion but I do not want to take away from Deputy Sherlock's work on this Bill. Great work has been put into the Bill in order for it to be put to the Dáil. I took the debate in the Seanad where we had this discussion. It is not that the Government is against the Bill - we were not against Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill - but I believe all my colleagues understand there is a process we must follow. We must go through a certain process or we will not be successful in this. We all want it to be successful, we want it to progress and we must do it the right way or it will not work. I believe that Deputy Sherlock understands this from his discussions with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and from the debate in the Chamber this morning. On the issue of broadband, I want to put Deputy Timmy Dooley's fears to bed. Unlike previous Governments which had money and did not fix or tackle the issue - I am not referring to the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Government because we did not have the money at that time - this Government now has the resources and is intent on fixing it. The plan is being led by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys. It will happen. We will finally have the broadband we deserve in the State. Tenders will, hopefully, be processed within the year and work will commence in 2018. The roll-out will happen quite quickly after that. The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government would have liked to have done it but we did not have the resources because of what we were left with when we came into government during 2011. Trust me on this. For many years, this issue should have been tackled but previous Governments did not do so. Deputy Dooley knows that and should be ashamed of himself raising the issue. It was so important and it held the State back. This Government is going to deal with it. It will be put to bed once and for all, and rightly so. I hope this allays any concerns.

Ireland's Clean Coast groups, which are led by An Taisce and supported by the Department, do great work and are viewed as world leaders in that respect. Some issues were raised around that. We welcome and want to have an input into legislation such as this Bill but we must take a comprehensive approach. The Minister and the Department will consider a bespoke marine environmental Bill covering this and linking all the issues, such as dumping at sea and marine protection areas. Deputy Howlin asked about the process but either way we will try to find the quickest way to do it. I cannot give a timeline because we know the way this works. We are committed to doing it and we will make it happen. There is, however, a process to go through. It is not enough to just notify the Commission. According to Commission guidelines and rulings, Ireland is required to present a robust justification and this is what we are doing. We are doing it the right way to make sure it will stand the test of legislation. On the problem of plastic disposable tableware, we understand the French are looking at the issue. It is worth noting the EU is trying to put together a comprehensive plastic strategy to address many such issues and we will honour it. We are part of the discussion and are monitoring it. We will certainly be part of the leadership and will not be sitting on the fence. In regard to the issues raised by Sinn Féin, the UK will only achieve approval after making a robust justification, as we must do. France has submitted its views to the Commission and we will deal with that also. We never said we cannot do this. We agree with the intention and the sentiment and we want to do this but we must follow the procedure to make sure we have the robust justifications that are required. Consultation has already taken place in that regard. We are making progress. Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill would also have followed this process. We are committed to doing that. To be fair, when the Minister, Deputy Coveney, commits to doing something in the Dáil or the Seanad, he follows through and makes it happen. I believe Deputy Sherlock knows this. I want the House to believe us when we say we are intent on doing this. This is not to fob Deputies off today; we are intent on doing this and we will follow it through. Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke on the marine litter problem and we all agree it is horrendous. We are supporting groundbreaking research to commodify green litter and turn it into a resource that would have great application in the developing world as well as in Ireland. I was a former Minister of State with a research portfolio, as was Deputy Sean Sherlock, and we are well aware of the great work being done in the research community in the commercial and education arenas and in bringing the two together through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and other agencies. The Irish Research Council is doing great work. A lot is happening with our research people who are doing much good work around climate change and marine and environmental issues. Research is being carried out in University College Dublin, the National Maritime College of Ireland in Cork and in the Marine Institute in Galway. We need to build on that research and recognise it. Deputy Catherine Martin spoke of monitoring. The EPA is currently funding research with a view to informing a micro-plastics monitoring programme. The Department, the Marine Institute and others are working nationally and with other states to develop an effective monitoring programme. It goes back to investing in research. We have committed to this as a country and we need to do more of it. I know many Deputies would not agree with me because of previous experience, but it is important and there are key areas in which we are doing this. If we invest in research it will future-proof our economy and help to future-proof our environment. This is important for people who live in Ireland as climate change is key. It is key in our agenda and it is certainly high up on the Minister's agenda also.

I thank colleagues who have welcomed the principle of the Bill. It is very clear there is an intention on the part of the House, on a cross-party basis, to legislate for the issue and to ensure that we can put in place a robust mechanism that will offset the dire economic costs of the presence of microbeads and micro-plastics in our environment.I thank Members for their support in the first instance when the legislation was introduced. The Green Party Deputies were the originators of the Bill and I acknowledge their role. We hope to bring this legislation a step further in seeking to deal with the legal issues pertaining to the European Union and the specific treaty provisions. I reiterate that I accept the bona fides of the Minister, Deputy Coveney and Minister of State, Deputy English on the Government's intention to legislate on this issue. Since proposals will come before the Government in June, if I understand the Ministers correctly, I would hope that we could be in some space to have this before us again by autumn of this year. Am I correct in understanding that there may be a proposal to bring it before the Government in June? The officials are not saying that.

This is increasing the likelihood of a hard Brexit, an outcome we certainly do not want in Ireland. The posturing on both sides, including the selective leaking of what happened during the dinner between Prime Minister May and Jean-Claude Juncker, is serving to increase tension and make the impending negotiations even more difficult than they will be. This hardening nationalistic approach has provoked a major British supermarket chain, the Co-op, to announce that it will not stock any beef other than British beef on its shelves. While the Co-op does not stock Irish beef, it is clear that if other supermarkets in the United Kingdom follow suit, there will be clear consequences for the Irish beef sector. I expect the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to raise these issues to ensure it will not become a trend. In the forthcoming negotiations Ireland needs to be an advocate for a calm, measured and firm approach. The Tánaiste will be aware of a survey published by Chartered Accountants Ireland earlier today. It deals with the levels of awareness and preparedness of Irish businesses for the customs issues that will inevitably arise if the United Kingdom leaves the customs union, which seems a near certainty. The striking results of the survey should serve as a wake-up call for the Government which needs to realise it must do more to help businesses to prepare for the fall-out from Brexit if the United Kingdom leaves the customs union. The survey has found that there is a startling lack of practical customs knowledge and a lack of understanding of the issues that will arise if the United Kingdom leaves the customs union. Customs duty is primarily a self-assessment tax. Businesses have not had to deal with this issue for almost 25 years because of the Single European Market. There seems to be a distinct lack of corporate knowledge on the island of Ireland of how the customs system will work. The crucial point is that even in a soft Brexit scenario in which no trade tariffs would apply, significant onerous obligations would be placed on Irish businesses to comply with new customs arrangements. It is clear that we need to secure a funding mechanism at EU level to help Irish small and medium-sized enterprises to deal with the cash flow implications of compliance with new customs and VAT arrangements. We need a programme of education and resourcing in order that firms can deal with the significant extra cost and compliance burden that will arise. As part of the negotiations, we must secure agreement on the protection of the common transit area, which is key if Ireland is to be able to export to mainland Europe via the United Kingdom. What are the practical steps the Government is taking to help business to become more prepared for the serious and inevitable consequences of Brexit, regardless of the form it will take?

Everyone has to agree that it is a testament to those efforts that our priorities are so clearly reflected in the European Union's approach and have been stated in the guidelines. Our priorities have been highlighted in all of our discussions and in all of the bilateral work done by our embassies abroad, ambassadors and each individual Minister, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is accepted that these priorities need to be protected as we move forward. The Government's intention is to intensify its efforts and focus on the economic implications of Brexit. Obviously, this is not where we want to be. We do not welcome the decision taken by the United Kingdom. We want to mitigate as much as possible in the Irish context the serious consequences it will have. We will focus on the economic implications of Brexit because we want to reinforce the ongoing competitiveness of the economy and protect it from the negative impact of Brexit. We will pursue every possible opportunity to ensure that will happen. A further paper on the economic implications of the Brexit challenge is being prepared by the Government. It will draw on all of the work done across Departments and reflect the core economic themes outlined by the Taoiseach and others. We need sustainable fiscal policies that will ensure we will have the capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit. We must have policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns and to strengthen competitiveness. All of the Government's recent actions and decisions have been taken in support of these goals. Priority is being given to policy measures that dedicate resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions that will be most affected by Brexit. As I said, we must take the economic opportunities arising from Brexit and help businesses to adjust to new logistical or trade barriers. All of these issues are priorities. The Deputy mentioned an announcement made by a UK retailer, the Co-op. It is important to note that the Co-op chain in Britain is not currently a customer of Irish meat exporters. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia are very conscious of the need to ensure ongoing engagement with customers of Irish products in the United Kingdom. That engagement is continuing at the highest levels.

The Tánaiste has not dealt with the core issue I put to her. Today's report provides a stark illustration of the lack of preparedness of Irish businesses for the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the customs union. Such an eventuality would lead to increased costs, regulation, compliance requirements, complexity and, potentially, barriers to trade in the day-to-day operations of Irish businesses. What is the Government doing in practical terms to help businesses to prepare for these challenges? My real concern is that the focus of the negotiations in the next 18 months or so will be on the terms of the exit and that trade will come after this. Such an approach would be of no comfort to the tens of thousands of Irish workers who depend on trade with the United Kingdom on a day-to-day basis. What is being done in practical terms to help Irish businesses to make the preparations they need to make? I refer, for example, to the inclusion of the common transit area in the negotiations that are about to get under way.

There is a Brexit response committee comprising different departmental divisions. As recently as 11 April, there was a meeting with all the stakeholders in the agricultural area. Close consultation with Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Enterprise Ireland is ongoing. Additional resources have been given to those bodies to help them work with the stakeholders, explore the issues and prepare for them. Extra supports for dealing with Brexit-related issues have been given to these companies and bodies. These are the practical actions which are happening now.

It is welcome that a senior Minister has publicly backed calls for a referendum to be held as soon as possible. The eighth amendment and its consequences impact on thousands of women. It affects women and their families in every corner of this State. For far too long, women have been denied dignity, respect and basic services. They had their voices silenced and their rights denied. We cannot be silent any longer. Up to ten women and girls leave this State every day to avail of terminations abroad. That is the reality. These are not just women on a spreadsheet or in a news report. They are our sisters, our mothers and our friends. We cannot continue to fail them. The eighth amendment is a relic of the past. It has to go and be replaced with compassion. A recent report published by the UN Human Rights Committee found that the constitutional clause, which bans abortion for women carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality, subjects women to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Sinn Féin, for its part, supports the right of a woman to seek termination of pregnancy where her life or mental health is at risk or in grave danger. We also support the choice to terminate pregnancy in the cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest. This requires a referendum and a repeal of the eighth amendment. It would also require the enactment of new legislation to allow for terminations in these cases. By establishing the Citizens’ Assembly, the Government attempted to shirk its responsibility to address this most important matter. It was an attempt to block the Dáil from dealing with the eighth amendment and to stifle the obvious demand for a referendum as soon as possible. The Government’s political interests were placed ahead of the needs of women. Now that the assembly has concluded its deliberations on the eighth amendment, it is clear that people are not willing to stand for this treatment any longer. The assembly’s recommendations demonstrate a clear appetite for reform and change of the current situation regarding access to terminations. What is also clear is that there cannot be any further delay and any more kicking the can down the road on the part of the Government. The Oireachtas needs to do its job. We need to debate the issues and put the issue of the eighth amendment to the people in a referendum. The women of Ireland need to know when this issue will be put. They need to know the Government’s mindset on the timing. Does the Tánaiste agree that a referendum should be held in the earliest possible timeframe? When will the Government allow for a referendum to be held? When will the people finally have their say on the eighth amendment?

I was proud to be a member of the Government which dealt with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. The issues addressed in that Act had not been on the floor of this House, or had not been dealt with, until the previous Government decided to deal with them, as had been recommended by the Supreme Court many years previously. This is a delicate and difficult issue for every individual and society as to what exactly the legislative framework ought to be. What we have had is a helpful and an important Citizens’ Assembly which addressed this issue and arrived at certain conclusions. That is the opinion of the Citizens’ Assembly. It is important we listen and examine carefully and await the final report in June on its deliberations. We will all learn quite a lot from reading the detail of its deliberations, once we receive the report. That was an important procedure with which Deputy will agree. Where to from there? The Government has been clear that a committee will be established with all parties and Independents represented on it. That will take place over the next several months. Then the Dáil has to take decisions. I expect there will be a referendum after that. A clear process has been laid out in terms of the deliberations of this House. It is a different procedure to decide on legislation as opposed to hearing the opinions of the Citizens’ Assembly. No doubt, we will all take that into account. Framing legislation in this area and what might replace the amendment is a complex issue. It demands the kind of approach the Government has laid out which involves the Dáil committee specifically examining it, and then the Dáil deciding where to go after that. There are timeframes laid out for that.

It is 25 years since the X case when a raped and traumatised child was dragged through our courts. Since then, as the Tánaiste knows, we have had an alphabet soup of tragedy and maltreatment of women, story after story piled high. Yet the political system stood still and looked the other way. This politics of delay cannot be tolerated any longer. The Citizens’ Assembly was intended as a vehicle of political management rather than attaining any real clarity or result. The committee will be established but that too must work expeditiously. We must have a clear sense of when the referendum will be put and when people will have the opportunity to repeal the eighth amendment. The Tánaiste’s colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has no difficulty in stating her preference for an early referendum. Simply, will the Tánaiste confirm and clarify that this is a view shared by the Government?

We have a bad history when it comes to women's reproductive rights. Quite clearly, we are at a point where further and detailed discussion is needed. As I said, no country in the world finds it easy to decide on the exact parameters around this issue or how it should be approached. Clearly, the Government has set in motion an approach which involves a Dáil committee and will involve representatives of every Member across the House. It behoves every Member on this committee to come back to the Dáil, so decisions can be taken. There is a timeframe of a number of months for this committee. At that point then, the Government will take an overall approach. My own belief, as I have often stated, is that the Constitution is not the place to deal with these complex issues. I believe a referendum should be held as early as possible.

The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, informed Deputy Pringle and me on 5 April that his Department is undertaking what he termed "a technical evaluation" of how income-contingent loans would work. He seems to have pushed ahead with this study without consulting the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills. When will the technical evaluation be published and will it include a full cost-benefit analysis? Before the Minister gave this reply last month I chaired a meeting with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, attended by a cross-section of Deputies. The union leaders, Ms Annie Hoey, Mr. Michael Kerrigan and their colleagues outlined powerful arguments against proceeding with student income-contingent loans. Internationally, where student loan schemes have been introduced, there are large-scale debt default rates. In Australia, for example, outstanding debt is over 35 billion Australian dollars, with average student debt at almost 40,000 Australian dollars per graduate. In England, the poorest 40% of students will graduate with debts of nearly £44,000 and the "financialisation" or sale of student debt to the private sector is another reprehensible feature of the English system. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I represent a constituency with districts where third level access is below 20%, and in many parishes it is just 35% or under that level. The introduction of student loans would have a further damaging impact on progression and access to third level education, especially for important sectors of society, including students with a disability, lone parents, first-time mature students, part-time and flexible learners, students from a farming background and students on grants. One insuperable argument against income-contingent loans is the Irish tradition of emigration and the fact we are an emigrant nation. The Higher Education Authority recently indicated that 12% of graduates emigrate for a first job. The USI estimates that nearly 4,000 additional graduates will emigrate to avoid repayment of large graduate loans. Does the Tánaiste agree that one fundamental reason for not proceeding with income-contingent loans would be the major ongoing cost to the State as outlined at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills last Tuesday by Dr. Charles Larkin of Trinity College Dublin and Dr. Shaen Corbet of Dublin City University? They oppose income-contingent loans and characterise them as a very risky course of action for the Exchequer, with complex legislative set-up, administration and loan recovery systems, costing the State €10 billion over the first ten years. Is Fine Gael still determined to introduce income-contingent loans given the party's opposition to treating third level education as a critical public good in the 2016 general election? The party's partners in Fianna Fáil are of course sitting on the fence with this, despite 2017 being the 50th anniversary of the great Donogh O'Malley introducing free second level education.

The package of measures announced for the sector in the budget reflects this priority, which will help all students. To recap, we are providing an initial investment of €36.5 million in the sector this year and €160 million over the next three years. It is the first significant investment in the sector for nine years and we are in a position to do this because of the improving economy. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has made it very clear he intends to continue that support. It is the first significant investment in nine years, a period in which State investment in higher education fell by 33%, or €463 million. We are now keeping pace with the demographic increases and there are also targeted initiatives in priority areas, particularly in trying to ensure there is more focus on research, flexible learning and dealing with thousands of students benefitting from initiatives. There is a multi-year spending plan for the sector and we want to ensure we have a sustainable system of funding going forward. As the Deputy knows, in 2016 the Minister published the Cassells report and, as committed to in the programme for Government, the report is currently with the Oireachtas committee. The Minister has said this is an area where it would be preferable to have broad political consensus and he is working to build that here. The Oireachtas committee is examining the option mentioned by the Deputy as well as other options. The consultation paper on the introduction of the Exchequer mechanism was published in March and it stated that technical work will be undertaken on an income-contingent student loan scheme by an interdepartmental group in order to inform future policy options, including in light of the recommendations that will come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills. The work is of an administrative and technical nature and it will ensure the Department is in a position to respond once the committee has completed its work and published its recommendations. These issues are under ongoing consideration by the Department. The Minister will examine the final report and he is also doing some background work. No decision has been taken in this regard but the issues are being examined. Further work will be completed in order to ensure we have all the information we need.

There must still be a fundamental and early decision on this and the Tánaiste did not reply to the central question of when the evaluation report will be produced and if there is an implementation plan for what I would regard as a very regressive proposal. It was her Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Government that slashed third level funding over the past eight or nine years, from almost €1.5 billion to under €1 billion. If the Government proceeds with this, it may as well tear up the national plan for equity of access to higher education for 2015 to 2018. With 45% of our workforce now being graduates, with education playing a primary role in Ireland's growth and recovery since the early 1990s, should the Government not look positively to the long-term earning power and taxes of graduates to fund a free third level system rather than embarking on a regressive, unwieldy and dangerous system of student loans? It should in this case follow the good example of Scotland, Germany and France.

I will point out a couple of facts about the equity issue. Over 3,000 students from disadvantaged groups will benefit from the additional package of €8.5 million to support more disadvantaged students, including lone parents and Travellers, in attending higher level education. This includes the introduction of the full maintenance grant worth almost €6,000 from September 2017 for 1,100 postgraduate students in the lowest income category. That is absolutely targeted at equity issues that have been correctly raised by the Deputy. I can also speak about other initiatives for support, including the new frontier research programme, with work being done to cover increasing enrolments. There is also provision for expansion of apprenticeships and so on. There are quite a number of issues in addition to the Deputy's point on grants, with actions being taken to achieve equity in access to education.

In that country of approximately 23 million, 500,000 have died, with 2 million people disabled because of lost limbs or other disabilities. There are 6 million people displaced internally and there are now over 5 million displaced refugees outside their own country. It has not gone away as an issue, despite going off the news cycle. Almost 250,000 people in the first three months of the year were added to that list. Turkey has taken some 3 million refugees.Lebanon has taken approximately 1 million, Jordan has taken approximately 700,000, the rest of Europe is taking 900,000 and we have committed to taking 4,000. We set a timeline of two years from the introduction of the programme. How many refugees from Syria have we accepted to date? How many does the Tánaiste expect us to have received by the deadline we have set? The people of Ballaghaderreen and those at other emergency reception centres have shown real strength and done us proud with the welcome they have given the refugees. However, from what I hear from the people involved, the State, unfortunately, is not doing enough. We are not getting the welcome right. We are not engaging local communities. Additional resources and additional community officers must be provided to help with the integration of these people. We could learn from the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland, which has a far better record in terms of involving non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and other outside bodies to be part of the welcome. What changes in resources will the Tánaiste make in her Department? I hear that there is a lack of resources in respect of translation facilities and administrative and other staff and that this is part of the reason we are behind our target for welcoming people. Finally, we hear that since the introduction of the new international refugee process which was put in place early last January Ireland is still operating one of the least humane systems for asylum seekers. Next to Lithuania Ireland is the least progressive in terms of allowing refugees in asylum centres to work. I received a telephone call in my house during the week through some contacts in the Syrian refugee movement from a young man who told me, "I am going to the city of Ballaghaderreen". God bless us, that is great. It could be great for the town of Ballaghaderreen, but we must get the refugees working. We must not have that young man losing his spirit, confidence or mental health further by leaving him to languish there. We must get such people working. What will the Tánaiste do to allow that to become part of the welcome for the 4,000 people we have committed to take?

Most countries in Europe agreed to accept certain numbers based on criteria that were established by the European Union, but we proactively agreed to do it. Since then, huge resources have been put in place to ensure that we will meet our commitment. Refugees are arriving almost every three weeks at present. As I have often said, there was a slow start to the programme not just in Ireland but also across Europe. The reason is that the systems in Greece and Italy were chaotic for registration. As we saw, refugees moving throughout Europe were not being registered. That situation has changed dramatically and the refugees who arrive in Greece are all being registered, given accommodation and arrangements are made for them to be relocated to other countries. Once that system was up and running Ireland was in a position to receive the refugees it had indicated it would receive. My Department has been sending teams to both Lebanon and Greece regularly over the last 18 months to ensure the programme works and proceeds. I agree with what the Deputy said about community responses in this country. We are fortunate to see the responses given by communities to refugees in need both in Ballaghaderreen and in other places. We have not experienced some of the attitudes and reactions to refugees that have occurred in other countries. Of course, Ireland is not a front-line state and is not dealing with the numbers that there are in other countries. However, the programme is under way. We are also working on the motion passed by the Dáil in respect of taking minors from Calais. That programme has started and young people have already arrived in this country. We have sent teams to France on a number of occasions to ensure that the commitment is being met. However, it takes time. Over 1,000 refugees have arrived under the commitment we made. They are primarily from Greece and Lebanon. There have been delays in Italy because Italy wants us to accept the security it carries out and will not let An Garda Síochána carry out the vetting there. We are not prepared to accept that. We have had detailed discussions with the people concerned to try to resolve that, but we have not been able to resolve it for security reasons. We will have to take more people from Greece to fulfil the numbers to which we have committed.

However, nobody believes that we will reach our commitment if it has taken 18 months for just 1,000 refugees out of 4,000 to arrive. I would welcome the possibility of taking in the additional 3,000 within the next few months but I do not believe it will be possible. However, let us make an effort and see if it can be done. Will the Tánaiste commit to making that possible, to ensure we maintain public confidence and maintain the welcome given not just in Ballaghaderreen but also in Dungarvan and other centres? We must put more resources in the Tánaiste's Department. The problems do not all lie with the Italian civil service. We must examine what resources we are deploying, including within the Department, given that we are so far behind in what we said we would do. The Tánaiste must deploy additional resources and part of those resources must tap into community resources to achieve a multiplier. Finally, what comes next after the autumn? What comes next in our commitment? Where do we go from here? This is 4,000 out 5 million or 6 million refugees and 11 million displaced people in the country, so it is only a drop. What is our policy on what comes next after this original commitment?

We took 520 extra. Due to the slowdown on the other area of relocation we took more people from the refugee camps to increase the numbers. We continue to be flexible in terms of trying to respond to the need that exists and to meet our commitment on the numbers. The Deputy referred to resources. All Departments have committed personnel resources. A stakeholder meeting is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, on a regular basis to ensure we respond to the needs of the refugees who are arriving, be they in respect of social protection, health or education. They have complex needs and these must be met. They demand a response not only from the Department of Justice and Equality, and we have put in extra resources, but from all Departments. That is essential. The current commitment in the resettlement and relocation programme finishes in September or October this year. At that point the European Union will examine the situation again.

It is the Government's intention to use the proceeds from the sale of AIB to pay down debt. Is that because the Government believes it is the right thing to do or is it because it believes it must do so under the fiscal rules?

Four days after the shooting Deputy Gerry Adams was in receipt of disturbing information as regards this individual and his relationship with An Garda Síochána. He wrote to the Tánaiste eight times and to the Taoiseach four times. The Tánaiste did nothing on the case. He then made a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.It falls very short of the kind of investigation this very disturbing and serious case demands. So far, the Taoiseach has given a deaf ear to the family of Siobhán Phillips who called for a public inquiry. When will the Tánaiste give an account of these events to the Dáil and answer questions about this serious turn of events? I believe that needs to happen without delay and should happen next week when the Dáil is in session.

She is seeking a meeting with the Minister for Health, which he promised, regarding gaining access for her daughter to medicinal cannabis. I appeal to the Government on this issue. We have had mixed and worrying signals that perhaps the reason the Minister does not want to meet Vera Twomey is because he is trying to severely restrict access to medicinal cannabis for people like Ava Barry and others who are suffering and need this product. In the past ten days the medical profession of this country voted that people like Vera Twomey, who have a prescription from a general practitioner, should have access to this product. Why is the Minister and Government second guessing the medical profession in this country and leaving people like Vera Twomey suffering outside the gates?

In an answer to a question some weeks ago the Taoiseach said that for the medication to be legalised in this country it would have to be done through legislation which, in his view, would take some time. He also said a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children could result in a licence being given on compassionate grounds. This meeting took place but, unfortunately, further hurdles have now appeared and Vera is unable to access the medication on compassionate grounds. This lady wants to go home to her child and we have to have some compassion. She had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Harris, who promised a follow-up meeting which has not taken place.

I draw the attention of the Tánaiste to the severe shortage and pressure on Garda numbers in Donegal. A recent reply to a parliamentary question indicated that the number of full-time community gardaí in the county has been reduced from 21 to two, because Donegal only received 13 of the 815 new recruits from Templemore. Does that concern the Tánaiste? It should. I ask that the Tánaiste and Government liaise with the Garda Commissioner to ensure the shortage in Garda resources in the county is addressed.

That is an operational decision for the Commissioner. I have no doubt she will bear in mind the points the Deputy has made. The allocation is based on the need in different counties. It is an independent decision that is made by the Commissioner. It is an operational decision.

Unfortunately, a young Palestinian, Mazan al Maghrebi, has become the first to die on that hunger strike.

In fact, the detail of the cost rental model was to be rolled out in the third quarter of 2016. Unfortunately, we have yet to see it. With tens of thousands of individuals and families who are ineligible for social housing increasingly locked out of the private rental and home purchase markets, when will the model of affordable rental be introduced?

The finalisation of the draft is being settled between the officials of both Departments involved and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and I have signed off on the principles relating to it. The delay was related to the expectation that the World Health Organization would provide revised figures on noise, in particular from wind farms, at a meeting last Monday week in Brussels. The organisation has now informed us that the figures will not be available until the summer and we are not prepared to hold off on providing the draft regulations for consultation in the interim. We will make provision for that. The drafting must be completed before we bring the memorandum to Government.

We saw the great benefit of having Deputy Naughten present for questions on promised legislation today. At the start of this Dáil, most Ministers were in attendance as part of what was an effective reform. That there are only two Cabinet Ministers here now really undermines that. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to remind the Cabinet of the reform we expected.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Diplomatic Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was published on 5 April. The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the efficiency, efficacy and clarity of various arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions and international organisations. To this end, the Bill proposes various amendments to the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, as well as to citizenship, immigration and employment permits legislation, which have been developed in consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The amendments are largely of a minor and technical nature. I will briefly outline the contents of the Bill which contains three Parts with 11 sections. Part 1 concerns preliminary and general matters. Section 1 provides for the Short Title of the Bill, while section 2 is a technical clause.  Section 3 repeals section 49 of the 1967 Act which requires the Government's consent to be obtained before an Irish citizen can be appointed to serve in the State with an international organisation covered by the Act. This provision which is now 50 years old is no longer in line with contemporary practice in international relations.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	164	I am sure we can supply it. Another concern with section 49 is that it may be construed as interfering with an international organisation's right to freely appoint its own staff. Only a small number of Irish nationals serve in the State with international organisations covered by the 1967 Act. Furthermore, privileges and immunities enjoyed by officials of international organisations are of a much lesser and more functional nature in comparison with the wide-ranging privileges and immunities that apply to diplomats attached to foreign embassies. For these reasons, it is considered appropriate to repeal this provision. Part 2 of the Bill amends the Government's powers to make certain orders under the 1967 Act. Pursuant to powers set out in Part 8 of that Act, the Government may make orders extending privileges and immunities to an organisation, body or individual. For shorthand purposes, I will refer to these as "Part 8 organisations". Such a procedure is considered desirable in order to extend routine privileges and immunities, as required, to give effect to the State's international obligations and to do so expeditiously without the need for primary legislation but in accordance with the principles and policies established by the Oireachtas. Some 60 orders have been made pursuant to Part 8 since the mechanism was established under the 1967 Act. In 2006 amendments were introduced to Part 8 to clarify the parameters within which the Government may make an order, enabling the Government to confer on Part 8 organisations privileges and immunities similar to those conferred on diplomatic missions. However, in practice the nature of Part 8 organisations is likely to be more similar to that of the United Nations or other international organisations dealt with in the Act. Therefore, it would be preferable to enable the Government to confer privileges and immunities on Part 8 organisations comparable to those enjoyed by the United Nations or other international organisations. Part 2 of the Bill aims to enable this by broadening slightly the parameters of the order making power. It is intended that any such amendment would provide the flexibility required under the Government order procedure, while respecting constitutional limitations regarding the separation of powers. No Part 8 organisation could be given privileges or immunities unless they are equivalent or have like effect to what has already been conferred by the 1967 Act. Part 2 of the Bill will also permit the making of a Government order under section 42A of the 1967 Act in respect of arrangements with international bodies that do not, as a matter of law, constitute international agreements, for example, because the body is not an intergovernmental organisation. An example of such a body is the International Committee of the Red Cross, with which it is expected the Government will in the near future enter into a status arrangement which will include provisions on privileges and immunities.To give effect to such an arrangement, Part 2 of the Bill further permits the Government to make an order to provide for the confidentiality of ICRC communications. Ensuring the confidentiality of its communications is considered crucial for the ICRC in light of its unique role and mandate. Finally, Part 2 of the Bill contains a saver clause designed to ensure the validity of any orders made under Part 8 of the 1967 Act to date. This saver clause is modelled on section 50 of the 1967 Act, as inserted by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Act 2006. Part 3 of the Bill concerns citizenship, immigration and employment matters. The State's long-standing policy in respect of staff attached to diplomatic missions has been to exclude them from mainstream immigration controls and thus from entitlements to citizenship flowing therefrom. However, in its judgment of 24 June 2016 in the Rodis and Tolentino case, the High Court determined that two members of staff of diplomatic missions were entitled to have their residence in the State deemed reckonable for the purposes of naturalisation. The court noted that a specific statutory exception would be necessary to provide otherwise. This Bill provides for such an exception in section 9. Section 9 also clarifies the position in regard to citizenship by birth, making it clear that a child born in Ireland to a parent exempt from immigration controls under diplomatic arrangements will not acquire Irish citizenship unless they are entitled to acquire citizenship through another parent, such as where that other parent is an Irish citizen. The amendment provided for in section 9 will only apply prospectively and will be without prejudice to any period of residence accumulated prior to the entry into force of the Act. Section 10 complements section 9 by clarifying the relationship between immigration and citizenship legislation. It inserts a new provision into the Immigration Act 2004 listing specific categories of individuals who are exempt from the terms of that Act. Of particular significance is the fact that family members of domestic workers in diplomatic missions or diplomatic households will be expressly exempt from immigration controls for the first time. This means that those domestic workers will be permitted to be accompanied by their immediate family members for the duration of their posting in the State. This change is considered important in the first instance in order to respect such workers' right to a family life. There is also some concern that the lack of a family support network may increase a domestic worker's risk of exposure to isolation, exploitation and even abuse. A number of alleged instances of abuse of domestic staff in diplomatic missions and households have arisen over the years, which has led to the recent adoption by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of procedures and guidelines for missions. Facilitating the residence of family members of domestic workers will complement the safeguards introduced by these procedures and guidelines. The final section of the Bill, section 11, amends the Employment Permits Act 2003. The 2003 Act, as previously amended, permits the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to issue a certificate to permit a foreign national family member of a foreign government employee on posting to the State, who falls within the terms of a bilateral arrangement entered into with another government, to access the labour market without the need for an employment permit. These arrangements, known as working dependants agreements, are not typically entered into between countries within the European Economic Area because they are seen as inappropriate in the context of freedom of movement rules. This means that a third country national family member of an EEA diplomat in Ireland must apply for a mainstream immigration permission in order to avail of the right to work under European freedom of movement rules. In doing so, that family member effectively relinquishes their status as a family member under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Section 11 aims to regularise this situation, by permitting such family members to retain their status under the Vienna convention, including their exemption from mainstream immigration controls, but to be able to work through the issuing of a certificate by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Making this amendment will only affect a handful of people, but nonetheless it is considered a useful tidying-up exercise in the context of a miscellaneous provisions Bill. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies. With that, I commend the Bill to the House.

I want to talk about certain aspects of it. It is imperative that as a country we ensure there is legal clarity in regard to our diplomatic missions and that we address any ambiguities that currently exist. State-to-state relations among nations, under the guise of diplomatic missions, are essential for the conduct of international relations, and I will return to that towards the end of my contribution. Diplomatic missions are essential for maintaining diplomacy, forging common bonds, achieving foreign policy goals, expanding political, economic, social and cultural ties and the strengthening of relationships between nations. This Bill is welcome as it will enhance the efficiency and transparency of arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions. The Bill will make clear citizenship and immigration rules for foreign diplomatic staff, consular staff and their private staff by amending the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. Amending that Act, as the Minister mentioned, will address a gap in the existing legislation which was exposed in the case of Rodis and Tolentino v. the Minister for Justice and Equality in June 2016 in which the High Court determined that two members of staff of diplomatic missions were entitled to have their residence in the State deemed reckonable for the purposes of naturalisation. The court noted that a specific statutory exception would be necessary to provide otherwise. The Bill will close this loophole. It also makes it clear that the amendment will apply prospectively only and will not prejudice any period of residence that would have been deemed reckonable for naturalisation purposes prior to the passing of the present Act. Amending the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 in this manner should also reduce the State’s exposure to further litigation, which is to be welcomed. Furthermore, the Bill will also provide greater protection for domestic workers in diplomatic missions and households by amending the Immigration Act 2004. While I acknowledge the Minister introduced guidelines regarding the employment of private domestic staff in missions in 2014, this amendment will permit service staff to be allowed to be accompanied by their immediate family members for the duration of their posting and exempting them from mainstream immigration controls. As a consequence of this amendment, the State will be honouring workers' right to a family life and will also ensure service staff in diplomatic missions have a family support network that will diminish their chances of being exposed to isolation, exploitation and abuse. This is particularly welcome following a small number of reported incidences, as documented in a paper by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland in 2011, of personal and domestic staff in diplomatic households being subject to abuse and exploitation. I call on the Minister to make known to all missions in Ireland their legal obligations in regard to their private and domestic staff. It is imperative they are made aware of these changes and that we ensure all missions are fully compliant in this regard. The amendment to the Employment Permits Act 2003 to permit non-EU, EEA and Swiss family members of an EU, EEA or Swiss diplomat or other foreign government officials to engage in employment without an employment permit is also a welcome move as it aligns Ireland's position with the main EU member states' practice. While this Bill is not thought to have any cost implications, are there any implications for the issuing of diplomatic passports? Perhaps we could address that. The Minister in his response might also comment on the process in existing embassies and offices as to how diplomatic passports are actually granted for travel between countries. As I said, this Bill is a technical one and my party and I support its passage through the House. It is important this Bill streamlines diplomatic relations, as the Minister outlined in his speech. While we are talking about diplomatic relations, will the Minister advise the House on how Ireland voted on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women? Did Ireland support Saudi Arabia in its ascension to that committee? I do not accept the responses that have come from the Minister's Department. The Dáil is entitled to know, and I am certain the Irish people are entitled to know. I find it incredible that Saudi Arabia, with its track record on women's rights and equal rights should be sitting on a commission in the UN looking at the future status of women. I hope Ireland played no part in facilitating that position. The Minister mentioned it has been practice that these votes are not made public, which may be the reason why conspiracy theories abound about bodies like the United Nations. This is not a policy issue; it was a vote about the composition of a committee. The Minister, on behalf of Ireland, abstained in a UN vote on a commission of inquiry into Gaza and that was made public. I have been looking through UN documents and websites today and in particular, the 61st session on women's economic empowerment in the changing world of work. One can see all the contributions from the various countries. Why is it we in Ireland are not trusted with that information? It is fundamental. Does our Government, through the Minister, deem it appropriate that Saudi Arabia should sit on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women? I do not. Is it a question of trade ahead of human rights? Is that the decision that was made? I have proposed a debate in the foreign affairs committee on the operation of voting at the UN and when it is appropriate for those to be made public. I am not being irresponsible about votes being kept private because of national security or other reasons like that. This is about a composition of a commission on human rights, effectively. How can people understand there is an issue in letting the Irish people know how our Government voted?  From reports, it appears five European states supported Saudi Arabia and were part of the 47 votes it received. Belgium was one of those five. The Belgian Prime Minister has already apologised and said it will not happen again. I want to know what our Government did. What did our officials do in the UN? Did they support Saudi Arabia in getting a position on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women? We deserve that answer. While it is fine to pass technical legislation on improving diplomatic relations, I do not accept the statements that have come from the Department since early this morning that we have no right to know. We have a right to know. We live in a republic. We live in a modern democracy. While people can hide behind statements and say it is not normal diplomatic practice, people are very concerned about this. Did the Department believe this would just go away with a hope no one would notice? If Ireland did not support Saudi Arabia, the Minister should say so. He should answer people. I am suspicious of the fact the Minister will not give an answer. It leads me and many others to believe we supported the Saudis. If we did, it is reprehensible. It is akin to letting the fox into the hen house.  Any person in their right mind who looks at the track record of how women are treated in Saudi Arabia would find it disgusting that the Irish State would support Saudi Arabia in its endeavour to sit on a UN commission on the rights of women. They would find it reprehensible. If the Minister did, will he explain why he supported it? If he did not, he should tell us that. Perhaps there is a reason I cannot think of. Perhaps it is purely because of trade we can set aside our morals and human rights. I do not think we should. I hope the Minister will use the time in this debate to answer those questions. I have also tabled it at the foreign affairs committee. I want to use this opportunity and this Bill to put those points to the Minister. People deserve to know. They have a right to know. We do not live in Soviet Russia. The Minister can trust the people with the truth. He should tell the people and me, as an elected representative to the Dáil, what our Government and representatives at the United Nations did in that vote. How did they vote and why? We deserve to know that. I implore the Minister to stop hiding behind statements from Iveagh House and answer the questions. The Minister is answerable to the Dáil. He should answer those questions.

I am conscious we do not normally get legislation before us on it. I welcome the Bill, which is very technical in nature. I might be in error in some of the points I pick out of it. If the Minister had sent us his speech we might have gotten a better sense of the errors we have made in our speeches on the Bill. I welcome that the Bill will improve and formalise procedures for the operation of Ireland’s diplomatic relations. I have one concern, which I will come to later. First, in general, I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which will enhance the efficiency and clarity of arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions and international organisations. The lack of clarity has been commented on in the courts. The Bill will hopefully strengthen the rights of workers and their families. It is a positive development.  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 codify what is perhaps one of the oldest and most accepted fields of international law, namely the formal relations between states and their official representatives. To facilitate the peaceful and efficient conduct of these relations, these treaties grant diplomats certain privileges and immunity, including immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state and immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction. While this is an important aspect to the functioning of peaceful international relations, granting such immunity has been abused by a small number of diplomats in Ireland and abroad. It is important we state that from the outset. I welcome that Part 1 section 3 of the Bill repeals section 49 of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 which requires Government approval for Irish citizens to be appointed to international organisations serving in Ireland. Having such a requirement seems unnecessary and archaic and I welcome it will be repealed. I do not fully understand why it was there in the first place. I am sure there was a rational reason behind it at the time. It is outdated and is being removed.  Part 2 of the Bill includes some simple technical amendments to sections 39, 40, 42A, 43 and 50 of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. I welcome that it does not include an amendment to section 47 of the 1967 Act which was originally included in the heads of the Bill. Head 5 of the Bill wanted to amend section 47 by inserting "tribunal or other adjudicatory body or administrative authority," after "In proceedings in any court". In a positive development during the pre-legislative scrutiny work, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland pointed out this would extend immunity to the workplace relations bodies on matters of employment, which would be problematic and reduce workers’ rights and possible entitlements. It is critically important that employers, including embassies, are held to account by the employment laws of the State by the workplace relations bodies. While the issue of diplomatic immunity is contested in these settings, the Migrants Rights Centre has been able to file claims on behalf of domestic workers employed by diplomats and has had successful claims heard in the labour courts and other courts. While the original proposed amendment relies on the bodies to decide if immunity extends as a matter of law, the granting of certification in the first instance muddies the water by asserting that immunity does apply as a matter of policy. The impact of such a provision could disproportionately impact on the rights of workers to due process where their employment rights were deemed to have been breached.It would have also acted contrary to the guidelines relating to the employment of private domestic employees by accredited members of the mission which were introduced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2015. I welcome the fact such a provision has not been included in this Bill. We all know that with the vast majority of embassies there is no problem, but in a few well documented and controversial cases, major issues have arisen. Between 2008 and 2014, the Migrant Rights Centre referred nine cases of alleged human trafficking for the purposes of forced labour involving domestic workers employed in embassies and diplomatic households to An Garda Síochána. In one of the more prominent cases, a 17-year-old girl travelled to Ireland to work for a diplomat’s family, having been told she would be allowed to work part time and pursue her studies. However, on arrival she found she would be required to be the sole carer of a child with severe special needs. Her day apparently started at 5.30 a.m. and her employer assaulted her when she asked to use the phone to call her family. This was all documented. She was not paid for her three years of work and, worryingly, she still has not been compensated. Another case involved three Asian women who were brought to Dublin as domestic workers for a diplomat and his family. They worked for an average of 108 hours a week. Two of them were paid €134 per month and the third was paid around €160 per month as she had been working for the family for longer. Anyone reading the details of these cases in the newspapers would be shocked and horrified that this could go on in Ireland in the 21st century. Human rights workers in this area have said that because such domestic workers lose their visa status when they leave the employ of the embassy staff member, many feel bound to their employer and may be forced to stay in exploitative situations as a result. This is an anomaly that needs to be addressed. I thank the Domestic Workers Action Group which has done so much work in this area to highlight these difficulties. Under the Department's new guidelines, diplomats have to sign a contract agreeing to pay minimum wages, link workers with the Migrant Rights Centre and allow for labour inspections. This is significant and extremely welcome. However, we know that enforcement remains problematic due to the protections provided by diplomatic immunity under the 1961 Vienna Convention so it is important we remain vigilant in this area. I support my colleague's suggestion that the Minister would write to the diplomatic missions outlining the rules and regulations that operate in Ireland. This could be done in a diplomatic way, pointing out that issues that have arisen in the past should not arise in the future. Section 9 of Part 3 of this Bill is problematic and I am concerned over its inclusion. The section seeks to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 to provide that any period of time spent in the State while exempt from immigration controls, as workers in embassies are, is not reckonable for residency in the context of naturalisation. I believe that this is an important right that should not be undermined or interfered with in any way. I am also concerned that the section states that children born to diplomats and associated persons who are exempt from immigration controls do not, except in certain circumstances, qualify for Irish citizenship by birth. I would appreciate it if someone from the Department could explain that to me. I cannot understand the purpose of excluding what would be a very small group of people in this way and to write that exclusion into the legislation. The section does not seem necessary or proportional. I ask the Minister to explain why it is included and why these workers should be treated differently from other workers. I ask him to provide details on how many people have applied for naturalisation or citizenship in this way in recent years. Such information is important and might explain the inclusion of this provision. Why is this something that must be changed now? What is the policy goal of such a change? This is extremely concerning for me and it needs much more detailed discussion. I intend to raise this again on Committee Stage, where my party will seek to remove or amend it. Otherwise we will be voting against this Bill, which we do not want to do because there are many positive elements to it. Section 10 of Part 3 amends the Immigration Act 2004 in order to specify particular categories of diplomatic and associated persons who are exempt from mainstream immigration controls. This is welcome because it allows domestic workers in diplomatic missions or diplomatic households to be accompanied by their immediate family members during their posting in the State, which is a positive step. During the pre-legislative scrutiny stage of this Bill, representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre pointed out that the explanatory note defines domestic workers as inclusive of service staff but that subsections of the legislation were actually unclear as to whether service staff were included. They requested a subsection to specify that a member of the private staff is inclusive of service staff. I welcome that subsection (b) of section 10 of this Bill expressly specifies that private servants are included. I welcome the fact officials in the Department are listening as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of legislation and are taking ideas on board. Section 11 of Part 3 amends the Employment Permits Act 2003 to permit a foreign national family member of a foreign government employee on posting to the State who falls within the terms of a bilateral agreement entered into with another government to access the labour market without the need for an employment permit. This is a sensible and welcome amendment. It makes Ireland a much more welcoming place. However, we must ask about the situation regarding domestic workers in embassies and diplomatic households who are currently bound to their employers. If they try to leave, they lose their legal right to reside and work in this State. Should they not be included in an amendment to the Employment Permits 2003 Act and be allowed to apply for other jobs in the State? I am interested to hear the Minister's views in that regard. This is something I will also propose that we examine in more detail on Committee Stage. I welcome the fact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is updating and improving arrangements with respect to international organisations and the staff of diplomatic missions in Ireland. Some of the changes are very welcome but I am hugely concerned over section 9 of Part 3 of the Bill. I am not opposing the Bill at this Stage as much of it is very positive. I would like to have a more detailed and robust discussion about section 9 in Part 3. I particularly seek further information on why the Department has included it and unless I can be convinced of its merits and workers’ rights organisation in this area can support it, then I will have huge difficulty in supporting the Bill as a whole. I hope we can amend the legislation. I welcome the fact it has been brought before the House. Indeed, it is unusual these days for us to be dealing with legislation. The more information we get from the Department, the more we can interact in this process and improve this and future legislation.

The Diplomatic Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 amends a number of Acts, namely, the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, as amended, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, the Immigration Act 2004 and the Employment Permits Act 2003, as amended.The main purpose of this legislation is to enhance the efficiency and clarity of arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions and international organisations. It will do this in a number of ways, for example by removing the requirement for Government approval if Irish citizens are to be appointed to international organisations serving in Ireland; by revising the statutory provisions enabling the making of a Government order affording privileges and immunities; by providing that a period of residence in the State as a member of staff of a diplomatic mission, or as a family member of such a member of staff, is not reckonable for the purposes of naturalisation as an Irish citizen; and by clarifying the rules concerning entitlement to citizenship by birth of children born to members of staff of diplomatic missions. The Bill will also clarify the immigration status of staff of diplomatic missions, including family members, thereby strengthening the safeguards for the protection of domestic workers in foreign missions and diplomatic households and permit certain family members of employees of foreign Governments to access the labour market in this State while retaining their status under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In essence, this legislation will improve the overall operation of Ireland's diplomatic relations. I would like to look in more detail at the benefits that will be provided by this Bill. It will introduce more efficient procedures for legislating the conferring of privileges and immunities. It will improve the protections for domestic workers of diplomatic and consular missions and households. It will introduce much clearer immigration and citizenship rules. One of the main impacts of this Bill, when it is enacted, will be to enhance and enforce the ability of the State to meet its international requirements by transposing privileges and immunities into national legislation. This will result in less pressure on human resources in Government Departments. I am sure everybody agrees this will be welcome. The Bill will also provide clarity with regard to the State's immigration and citizenship rules. This should reduce the State's risk of exposure to further litigation. This legislation will align the State's position with the practices of the main EU member states regarding the status of foreign family members of diplomatic and consular staff appointed by those member states. As I have said, I believe this Bill will enhance the efficiency and clarity of arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions and international organisations. When we are speaking about international relations, it is important to comment on the upcoming Brexit talks. I commend the Taoiseach on his efforts to date in clarifying this country's concerns about Brexit. His efforts have already reaped success, with the EU Brexit team confirming that an open Border between the UK and Ireland has to be maintained. As a native of County Louth, a Border county, I know more than most about the effects of a hard Border on trade and on the day-to-day lives of those who live near the Border. We must never go back to the Border of the past. It is unhelpful for other political parties to scaremonger on this issue by suggesting we might go back to the days of old when we had a hard Border with terrorists running amok. We must be clear that the UK made its own decision to leave the EU and must bear responsibility for its own actions. While I agree that Brexit will be an enormous challenge for us in Ireland, I suggest we must also look at the positives. David McWilliams said shortly after the Brexit vote that the UK had handed Ireland one of its biggest opportunities ever. I tend to agree with him because I see opportunities for Ireland. Yesterday, a major financial services firm announced its plans to relocate 500 high-paid jobs from London to Dublin as a direct result of Brexit. Many Irish companies see the opportunities that exist. When the Taoiseach visited Dundalk recently, I brought him to meet the management team of Horseware Ireland, one of the real success stories of Irish business and which exports its products throughout the world. Since the Brexit vote, it has acquired British firms as part of its ongoing expansion plans. I agree that there are major challenges ahead, particularly for industries like agriculture, but every industry faces challenges. It is possible that in the long term, it will be better that our main industries are not so dependent on the UK market. We now have an opportunity to explore new markets. Surely this is an opportunity to make Brexit work for us. I hear a lot of people in Dundalk saying that the currency fluctuation will be a disaster. I agree that it is not helpful, but we should not forget that people along the Border have been living with the fluctuating value of sterling for years. This challenge did not start with Brexit - it has been here for years. Dundalk has had particular success in overcoming these challenges. I welcome the agreement on Second Stage of the Diplomatic Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017. As I have said, this Bill will enhance the efficiency and clarity of arrangements with respect to the staff of diplomatic missions and international organisations. It will clarify the immigration status of diplomatic staff and will improve the protections for domestic workers of diplomatic and consular missions and households. I commend the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on the hard work he has done in his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, including in respect of Brexit.

As I said at the outset, this largely technical Bill is designed to bring a greater element of clarity and efficiency to the arrangements that are in place for diplomatic missions and international organisations operating within the State. It also aims to strengthen further the safeguards for domestic workers in diplomatic missions and households. I would like to pick up on the points made by Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Seán Crowe, in particular. I thank Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick for his positive comments. Deputy O'Brien spoke about the communication of guidelines to embassies. I remind the House that I publicly announced the introduction of these guidelines in September 2014. Some of the groups that have been mentioned, including Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, welcomed my public announcement at that time. In addition, I invited the diplomatic missions to a briefing by my officials, who are continuing to engage at all levels with missions and their staff to ensure they are very clear on their responsibilities. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to inform the heads of diplomatic missions of any changes in legislation, particularly as provided for in this Bill. I compliment my officials for their unstinting work on behalf of Ireland at home and abroad. I would like to respond to Deputy O'Brien's point about the issuing of diplomatic passports. I remind the Deputy and the House that this Bill has no particular relevance to diplomatic passports which may be issued in certain circumstances to people who are not hosted abroad. The holding of a diplomatic passport does not confer any immunity or privileges. If the Deputy has particular concerns about such passports, I ask him to convey the nature of such concerns to me and I will be very happy to respond to him.

I thank the Deputy, and indeed Deputy O'Brien, for supporting this Bill. At all times, my departmental officials and I are determined to ensure privileges and immunities are not used as a cover for failing to comply with requirements under the Irish code of law. I referred earlier to the guidelines that have been introduced with the aim of minimising this abuse should it ever occur. I am very conscious of this issue. It is great that we have an opportunity to discuss it. If Deputies wish to highlight issues of a more detailed nature, I will be happy to engage with them on such issues on Committee Stage. When Deputy Crowe spoke about the position of embassy workers in the context of our immigration laws, he made the point that they are excluded from citizenship. Exemption from immigration controls is required by international law, including the Vienna Convention, which is an important international convention. Citizenship remains a matter for each state to decide on individually. Ireland would share the view, which is common to many countries, that the spirit of the Vienna Convention envisages people coming to this State as employees of a foreign Government for a particular period of time and then returning to that country, or indeed moving on to another country if a further international assignment is made, which is what usually happens.In these circumstances, it is considered appropriate to exclude them from mainstream citizen arrangements, just as they are exempt from immigration controls, one being something of a logical corollary of the other. In effect, employees of foreign governments are deemed to be their responsibility. In that regard, it is worth noting that Irish citizenship legislation which comes within the responsibility of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality makes provision for Irish public servants serving abroad to ensure their children, spouses or civil partners are effectively deemed to be present in Ireland so as to be able to benefit from Irish citizenship and Irish naturalisation rules. These are issues of a technical nature which we will have an opportunity to discuss in greater detail on Committee Stage. I welcome Deputy Seán Crowe's comments on the need for clarity on this issue and to ensure that what we enshrine in legislation will conform to best practice for everybody involved. Deputy Seán Crowe also made a further point on whether staff of diplomatic missions should be given the option of remaining in the State long term through an arrangement involving, for example, a work permit. Excluding mission staff from mainstream immigration citizenship arrangements has been long-standing, not only in terms of practice but also policy. It also reflects common international practice. It is considered that such a policy is consistent with the spirit of the Vienna Convention, whereby individuals are typically posted to a mission for a specific period. I understand, however, that there have been instances where former staff of diplomatic missions have been permitted to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds following the completion of their posting. Again, if there is a specific example or an issue on which the House considers an improvement could be made, I will be happy to consider it on Committee Stage. I thank Deputies for their contributions and commend the Bill to the House.

Do the reports that the scheme review will be delayed at European level have substance and will the Minister update the House on that?

The ANC scheme replaces the previous disadvantaged areas scheme and less favoured areas scheme. The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors. Under the new rural development regulation, eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria. In cases where a member state does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. A proposal to introduce an optional extension to the 2018 deadline is currently under discussion at European Union level. The bio-physical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are low temperature, dryness, excess soil moisture, limited soil drainage, unfavourable texture and stoniness, shallow rooting depth, poor chemical properties and steep slopes. My Department has commenced work on this project and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data for the new criteria. Department officials have also been in contact with the Joint Research Centre and DG Agri in the EU Commission about technical issues arising. This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process. It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.

It was reported that the Minister and Austria sought this extension. Will he confirm that is the case and why this is so? He indicates that people in the EU are currently considering that request but will the Minister give an update on when they will make a decision? Will it come at an upcoming Council of Ministers meeting or will it be communicated to the Minister?It sounds as if this is a matter of kicking for touch by the Minister and that he does not really wish to deal with the issue. That is my suspicion, so will he deal with it? If an extension is being considered and if it is granted, will it still be the case that the maps must be submitted by the end of this year? If so, will there be proper consultation with farmers in advance? It is crucial that fairness is brought to the scheme and that we ensure payment levels reflect the constraints on the land for which they are paid.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	178	The areas of natural constraints or disadvantaged areas payment is enormously significant for almost 100,000 farmers and I or any incumbent in my office would be obliged to take every step possible to protect the payment against anything that threatens it. When there is a review there is a question over what the outcome of the review will be. It would be preferable if we could seek and secure a continuation of the existing arrangements for a period of time, and it is undefined at this stage how long that might be. It would be incumbent on me to pursue that option. What arose in the context of the refinement of EU regulations dealing with the rural development programme was a request proposed by Austria, which we supported, that this particular proposal would be deferred for a period of time. It is likely to be at least 12 months. The Commission has yet to finalise that. It is part of what is called an omnibus regulation. To the best of my recollection, it was raised at last month's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting and we supported the Austrian proposal, as did a number of other member states. It is not certain yet whether the Commission will acquiesce in that request, but I believe it would be a good development. It would secure the status quo for a period of time that has yet to be defined. The reason an extension of time for the current scheme is being sought is that various member states are struggling to have the necessary work completed. Some members states have it completed and can opt into the new regime as soon as they are ready, but the Austrian position arose because it is not ready. We are not ready either and if this gives us more time to prepare, that is well and good. A consultation with the stakeholders will be critical to the preparations at any stage. I have given a commitment to that in the House previously when the Deputy and others have raised this matter. That will continue to be the case.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	179	The Minister indicated that we are not ready, but previously he indicated that he expected to be in a position to come forward with the maps in spring of this year. Certainly, that was indicated last year. Then it was changed to early summer. It is now early summer and the Minister has indicated that he is not ready. Can he elaborate on the state of his unreadiness and on the exact position in that regard? There has been no consultation with the farming community yet in terms of the current position of that mapping exercise, nor have any maps been provided. If an extension is granted at European level, and the Minister indicated that it could be for an indefinite period, will the Minister still have to submit the maps by the end of the year? Also, with regard to the €25 million that is committed for next year, will the Minister give a commitment that it will be allocated in a way that reflects the constraints on the lands for which it is being paid? A reform of the current payment system is required to ensure that there are increased payments in cases where lands have more constraints while at the same time ensuring that the valuable role of the ANC payment in the income of up to 100,000 farmers is protected.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	180	On the latter point, the €25 million commitment in the programme for Government is an endeavour to restore payments which were previously withdrawn. Obviously that payment commitment remains, but that is a matter for the budget later this year. It is certainly my intention to deliver on that commitment. It is unclear what the Commission's requirement would be if it amends the regulations in this area. I suspect it would then give member states more time to comply with the regulations. We had hoped that we would have been in a position to publish maps in the summer of this year, as I indicated at all stages. We are not in that space yet. If we get an extension of time it will enable us to meet with the new deadline at greater ease in completing that job of work. At all stages it will involve consultation with the farming organisations. I appreciate that meetings are being organised the length and breadth of the country by concerned farmers, including farmers who are within the disadvantaged area who fear that they may be excluded under the new bio-physical criteria and farmers who are excluded under the old socio-economic criteria who have an ambition to be included. Obviously the consultation process and the information that will be contained in the Department's analysis in due course will be communicated to farmers at the appropriate time. They will be given an opportunity to engage with officials and myself and my colleague, the Minister of State, at that stage. The process will be the same, but I suspect that if the Commission amends the regulation it will extend the timeline for preparation of the maps.

Many farmers are very concerned that if the category of mountain type land were removed they would be at a severe disadvantage. Perhaps the Minister could give me an assurance on that.

Is that because there was a view that they would not be able to meet the deadline and there was a delay in trying to get the mapping done and over the line? Ultimately, we are dealing with farmers' money and many farmers are very concerned that they are being kept in the dark on this. I am sure the Minister has been lobbied about this as well. The various farm organisations and individual farmers are anxious to know when the maps will be done, when they will be able to see them and when they will get some certainty as to where all of this is going. Places such as Leitrim, Sligo and west Cavan in my constituency are mountainous areas and they have a serious natural constraint. The hill farmers in particular are concerned about where this is going. Can the Minister give an assurance that this mountain type land will be retained within the scheme? Also, will he respond with regard to the delay that was expected and on why the Minister and the Department considered it necessary to seek an extension?

It would be wrong of me to give a guarantee on what areas will and will not be included because I cannot. I would be surprised if, in respect of the aforementioned areas, there was any significant change. It is because of the importance of the payment that we took the opportunity to support the Austrian request. We were not alone. I recall that France and a number of other member states were also supportive of the proposal. In the context of the uncertainty around this debate, it allows us to say that for the period of time the extension will be secured the status quo will remain. That is in itself a reassurance. At this stage, we do not have a guarantee the extension will be granted. The Commission is considering the request that was made and supported by a number of member states, including Ireland. As I said, we will remain committed to the ANC system, the commitment in the programme for Government in respect of additional payments in 2018 and consultation with farmers in due course where the information is available.

The point he made that he cannot guarantee he will get the extension, and that nobody else can, raises the question as to how far down the road he is of getting the maps prepared. How close to completion is the work? If we are in a situation where within a short period of time the Commission says there cannot be an extension, what will the position be? Have the Department and its officials reached a stage where they are ready to produce the maps? Are they finding it difficult to try to set out the new criteria and map it out? It is important people know the level of preparedness if we do not get an extension.

It is 15 May this year and I think it will be around the same date next year. I am sure if the deadline remained we would have met it. As I said, in respect of the uncertainty around this, if it was possible at a European level to have an extension of the current regime for any period of time, be it a year or whatever, that would be preferable to the uncertainty that would have faced some farmers in respect of the current process. That is why we supported the current regime. As I said, if it was the case that we were obliged to have this process concluded I am sure we would have met that deadline. It would have been reckless of us not to because not meeting it at that stage would have meant that we would have been obliged to phase out the payments on a digressive basis. We certainly were not going to go down that road. The judgment call I had to make was whether it was desirable to have an extension of the status quo. My judgment call was that for the almost 100,000 farmers who were in receipt of the payment it was preferable to the risks associated with the entire review process.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	188	GLAS and AEOS provide valuable support to farmers to deliver environmental benefits and public goods which will enhance Ireland's sustainability credentials into the future. They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancing biodiversity, water quality and the mitigation of the future impacts of climate change, while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices. The GLAS scheme is the latest agri-environment scheme available to farmers. It forms part of Ireland’s rural development plan 2014-2020. To date, in excess of 50,000 farmers have had applications approved into the scheme under three different tranches over a 14-month period. The approval of these farmers into the scheme has been achieved a year ahead of the original target set when the scheme was launched. The first full year of payments to participants in the first two tranches of the scheme is 2016. To date, over 91% of these participants have received their 2016 GLAS advance payment, which represents 85% of the total 2016 payment due. There are some 3,000 applicants who have not yet received this payment as their applications have not passed all the regulatory cross-checks of Department databases and validation checks required to support these EU co-funded payments. As the Deputy is aware, this is a complex scheme with over 30 different actions available which allows farmers a choice of environmental actions to suit their farms. However, with this flexibility of choice for farmers comes increased complexity in administrating the scheme. My Department has committed significant resources in developing systems, including IT systems, to support this level of complexity, with the system required to support multiple changes in land parcel details and multiple combinations of actions across holdings and parcels. Outstanding 2016 payments under GLAS 1 and 2 have been delayed due to a variety of issues, including the declaration of incompatible parcel usage on the basic payment scheme, BPS, application for a selected GLAS action, changes in parcel boundaries in respect of parcels selected for GLAS actions, an applicant no longer claiming a parcel on his or her 2016 BPS and incomplete documentation, such as an incorrect or incomplete low-emission slurry declaration form or interim commonage management plan. All cases which have passed all the required checks have been paid and cases continue to be paid as they are cleared. In addition, I want reassure the Deputy that my Department is continuing to review outstanding applications on a case-by-case basis, including contacting farmers directly by telephone, e-mail or letter with a view to resolving all issues with outstanding cases as soon as possible. In respect of the AEOS scheme, there were 8,640 valid AEOS applications due a payment for the 2016 scheme year. Of these, 7,436 have been paid, leaving 1,204 outstanding. Under the EU regulations governing the scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, must take place. As 2016 is the final scheme year of payment for the AEOS 2 scheme, rechecks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payments can be processed. This work is ongoing and payments for valid checked files are and will continue to be released on a weekly basis. A number of payments under both schemes continue to be held up due to incomplete documentation and all participants are reminded to respond to any correspondence and submit any outstanding documentation as soon as possible to facilitate payment. Payments under both schemes will continue on an ongoing basis as issues are resolved and cases are cleared for payment.

The Minister and Department made a commitment that they would be paid in October 2016. Then another commitment was made that they would be paid in December 2016. At a recent farmer's charter of rights meeting, the Minister and Department committed that all payments would be made by the end of April. On three occasions deadlines were set and promises made and on three occasions they have been not been met and have been broken. As a result, over 4,000 farmers across the country are waiting on GLAS and AEOS payments. On a county basis, 200 farmers in Donegal and as many as 400 in Galway are waiting on GLAS payments. The situation is totally unacceptable and it is a political failure on the part of the Minister to manage the issue and ensure farmers are paid on time. If it was the other way around and farmers were not compliant with the scheme, the Department would come down on them and would not be behind the door in terms of applying penalties. Yet, whenever the problem is at the Minister's end and he fails to live up to his responsibilities and promises, he expects a free pass. I know it is probably a fruitless exercise to ask the Minister to set another deadline and make another promise but can he tell us when the outstanding payments will be made? Can tell us how many GLAS 1 and 2 farmers are on the Department's system? How many have withdrawn from the scheme and how many will be ineligible for payments as per the Department's calculations?

It is an embarrassment to me and the Department that this issue continues.We have no vested interest in holding onto moneys that are due. It is an extraordinarily complex scheme with more than 30 individual actions into which a farmer can opt under GLAS. When one cross references that with basic payment applications and individual plots, it becomes a very complex scheme to administer from an IT point of view. We have applied additional resources but it is taking a great deal longer than we had hoped to resolve the matter. I was not at the farmers' charter meeting recently but for clarity I note that I understand that the commitment that was given was that all approved applicants would be paid by the end of April. I emphasise "approved". We continue to engage with a number of farmers in respect of outstanding documentation which is an issue on their side. I would have preferred to have been able to identify and correspond with those farmers earlier. I appreciate the financial consequences for those individual holdings and the fact that it makes budgeting difficult if one is expecting every week that a cheque for up to €5,000 will arrive. I assure farmers that we are doing everything possible. We have written to 1,500 of the 3,000 farmers in GLAS who are waiting and I hope we will have corresponded by the end of the week with the overwhelming majority of the remaining 1,500. On the Deputy's specific question, the number of farmers currently active in GLAS I is 25,460 and in GLAS II is 11,345. The number of farmers approved in the most recent GLAS tranche is 13,600.

Last December, farmers were waiting for a payment of up to €4,500 which they had factored into their financial year last year and their income plans for Christmas. It was one thing to be embarrassed that it was not paid then, but the Minister is still embarrassed in May with over 4,000 farmers continuing to wait for payments. It is a political failure to allocate sufficient resources to deal with the issue and to ensure that farmers were not left in the lurch, which is what has happened. That is down to how it was handled by the Minister and the Department. In the coming year and the current budget, €214 million is allocated for GLAS. There was a commitment that when the scheme was up and running at the maximum of 50,000, there would be a €250 million per year spend. What the Minister has in the budget for this year's payments is €36 million less than was initially indicated would be required. That is the Minister stoking up a situation where there will be insufficient funds to pay all of those who will be expecting payments at the back end of this year. Can the Minister comment on that? It behoves him, considering what happened last year, to make every effort and adopt every measure to ensure a similar scenario does not emerge at the end of this year. First and foremost, those who are still awaiting payment should be paid promptly and as a matter of priority. Efforts to do that must be made by the Minister.

It is not a question of resources from either an IT or staffing perspective, it is simply the volume and complexity of applications and having to walk through each application individually across parcels of land and up to 30 different options. When one is explaining, one is losing. I appreciate that. For farmers who have not been paid yet, it is cold comfort. As this is the last year of AEOS, there is an obligation to sign off on the full period of the scheme. That is why there is a more onerous duty on us in respect of the final payments on AEOS. Equally, we are working through that obligation. Deputy McConalogue has raised his point before about our commitments under the rural development programme generally and specifically in respect of the funding under this scheme. We will spend every penny of that funding and pay out. I suspect it will be like this year's basic payment scheme. Once we got through the teething problems associated with the first run of that last year, most people accepted that the initial payments ran through much more efficiently last October. I hope that what we are seeing now with GLAS I and GLAS II will not be replicated in future.

For those of us who live in rural Ireland and who are familiar with what has happened, it is very sad to see the level of disunity and rancour that exists. The industry is tearing itself apart and there are no winners in this situation. Everybody loses, in particular the owners and trainers of greyhounds who cannot run them at the high end of the market. Harold's Cross has been a bone of contention. As the Minister is aware, an agreement was concluded with the Department of Education and Skills to purchase Harold's Cross last week. Does the Minister intend to approve the sale of Harold's Cross? We have not had racing at Shelbourne Park for 12 weeks with the result that owners and trainers have lost prize money in the region of €300,000. As a result of Shelbourne Park not being available, we also have a situation in which trainers are running dogs down the country which is putting pressure on local tracks. I ask the Minister of State to outline his view and the view of the senior Minister and the Government.

Bord na gCon  has faced very difficult financial challenges in recent years and continues to operate in a difficult financial environment. Through the period of the recession, a significant reduction in commercial income from attendances at stadia, tote receipts and other sources coincided with a reduction in State funding for the sector.  The impact of these pressures has been  exacerbated by a significant debt burden. The Government has worked to restore State funding to its previous levels, but the challenges of reducing the debt and increasing commercial incomes remain significant. These matters  have been of significant concern for my Department for some time and it was against this background that Indecon Economic Consultants were asked to conduct an objective assessment of the board's activities. Indecon made a number of recommendations to improve the financial position of the board, including measures to reduce costs at loss making tracks, the development of new co-mingling and fixed odds betting opportunities and the development of television rights and other commercial opportunities at stadia. While all of these recommendations are important, Indecon also recommended that the board actively engage in a programme of asset disposals in order to reduce the debt in a meaningful way and in this regard referred to a number of specific assets, including Harold's Cross greyhound racing stadium. Bord na gCon has been working its way through the Indecon recommendations, but progress on the development of commercial income has been difficult. In particular, a significant burden of debt remains and inhibits the scope for investment in the sector.  Against this background, the board took the difficult decision in February to close Harold's Cross to prepare it for sale, in part because of its very close proximity to the Shelbourne Park stadium.  I understand that on 2 May the board received an offer from the Department of Education and Skills for the purchase of Harold's Cross stadium for the construction of a school or schools and has decided to accept it subject to obtaining the necessary approvals. To respond to one of the Deputy's questions directly, the Minister, Deputy Creed, and I expect to receive a proposal for the sale of the stadium from the board shortly and will give it due consideration it, taking into account the need to develop the sector.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 There is no doubt that the sector faces a number of significant challenges. It is widely acknowledged that there is a need for improvements in finance, governance and regulation. The Government has restored the Exchequer provision for the sector in recent years and brought forward the heads of a Bill to improve governance, strengthen regulatory controls, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. This is a sector that can make a significant contribution to the rural and urban economy and which enjoys widespread support from many sincere and passionate participants around the country.  If it is to reach its potential, it is essential that it develops a solid financial platform, reduces its debt and builds a reputation for regulatory best practice and integrity.

We need an answer on the Department's position on Harold's Cross. My understanding is that it is being sold, an agreement almost having been reached for moneys in excess of €20 million.We have been told consistently by the former chairman of the board that it is worth €4 million to €6 million and that it should not be sold because we would not get value for it. I would like a straight answer from the Minister of State to my next question because there will be no progress until we know where we stand. I have attended several meetings with groups and individuals and a question I am asked all the time is whether the Minister and the Government are considering sacking the board. Will the board be sacked? Do the Minister and the Government have confidence in it to lead and administer the Irish Greyhound Board? This question needs to be answered. Is there confidence in the board? Will it remain in position? If we had answers to these questions, perhaps we might get down to negotiations on the reopening of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium.

The approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must also be obtained. We are not at liberty because the Department of Education and Skills has requested that full details of the sale not be disclosed because of market sensitivities. There has been due process in a transparent way. Sacking the board is a very simple populist notion. No current member was a member of the board when the decision was taken to develop the new stadium in Limerick, which marked the beginning of the legacy debt. Indecon recommended that the board be strengthened with certain skill levels and that has happened. This is a thankless job and the board has progressed to work down the debt. It is a commercial semi-State company with a duty to manage the greyhound industry. We can play our part with new legislation to try to underpin it, but essentially we have to have confidence in the board to do its job. That is what it is there for. All appointments since 2015 have been made through the independent appointments service. We have not engaged or interfered with it. In line with Indecon's recommendations, those appointed have legal, veterinary, financial and banking skills. People speak about the board, but its membership has changed fundamentally.

Other public representatives and I have been lambasted, but my theory is very simple. The board needs to spend its money. It is servicing a debt and paying an interest bill of €1.15 million. As a consequence, there is no money left for marketing or the promotion of the industry and breeders and trainers are suffering as a result. The debt issue needs to be resolved. The Minister should ask the board for its solutions urgently. Does the Minister of State have confidence in the board? Will it be sacked or not? We need to know the answer to this question before we can make progress.

It is as simple as that. We have confidence in it. In its strategic investment business plan it envisaged necessary receipts of €12 million from the sale of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium to work down its debt. While, regrettably, I am not at liberty to disclose the actual sale value, it is substantial enough to deal with the debt significantly. The Deputy is dead right; money needs to be put into the industry in prize money, for promotion and marketing and the upgrading of some stadia that are beginning to look a bit dated, in the same way as horse racing stadia. We need to underpin it with new legislation in order to restore confidence. The Deputy made a point in his opening comments about the industry and sector being very divided. I appeal to everybody to avail of the mediation process available to see if we can have racing again in Dublin. It is very important that this happen without delay.

There was a massive increase in afforestation to meet our climate change targets. We need to learn from what has happened in the past 50 years and move to what I believe is a form of forestry with a higher value, with a higher value product, with far more jobs and where we protect biodiversity and the long-term quality of soil. It should be in the form of continuous cover forestry as in Germany, Switzerland and many other countries. Does the Minister of State have such a plan? Will he implement a plan to move from clear felling to continuous cover forestry? If so, how will it be done?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	200	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Continuous cover forestry, CCF, is a silvicultural system option in which the aim is to keep the overall forest canopy in place continuously, with low levels of soil exposure and any regeneration gap confined to about one third of a hectare in area. Sites suited to CCF are those where the crop is conducive to seeding, thereby facilitating natural regeneration, and where the risk of windblow is moderate to low following the felling of small regeneration areas or coupes. This silvicultural system is not so much an alternative to afforestation, as the forest must generally be planted in the first instance; instead on suitable sites it may be an option for forest owners where income can be generated from successive thinning operations as an alternative to clearfelling at the end of a rotation. In the Department's forestry programme, 2014 to 2020, continuous cover forestry is encouraged for new and existing native woodlands under both the afforestation and native woodlands conservation scheme. CCF principles and close to nature silvicultural techniques must also be applied to forests funded under the new agriforestry planting category. Supporting actions for CCF are also included in the targeted training submeasure of the forestry programme. My Department has supported research on CCF under COFORD's low impact silvicultural systems project from 2009 to 2014 and also in the more recent translation from French into English of the guidelines on continuous cover forestry which I will launch tomorrow at the Irish Forestry, Woodland and Bioenergy show at Stradbally Hall Estate, County Laois. I also launched Broadleaf Forestry in Ireland at Avondale in October last year. This COFORD publication provides extensive guidance on the use of silvicultural systems based on natural regeneration and continuous cover forestry. It took approximately 15 years to get the book ready.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
Furthermore, as part of the Department’s mid-term review of its forestry programme submissions have been called for to examine the possibilities to support forest owners in transitioning to continuous cover forestry under the woodland improvement scheme. With regard to a review of potential higher value outputs from CCF, they would include continuity of income from ongoing thinning operations as opposed to the lump sum at clearfell stage, with a consequent replanting cost. Non-wood benefits include the potential for greater forest resilience and habitat diversity. Under the COFORD's low impact silvicultural systems project mentioned, an economic study of CCF was carried out. The study examined factors affecting economic returns from CCF compared with a clearfelling system. The work will help to inform forest owners on the decision to move to a CCF system. Also funded under the COFORD project was the establishment of six research plots throughout Ireland, with five in Coillte forests and one in a private forest. The purpose is to have demonstration and research areas in different woodland types in Ireland so as to be able to demonstrate the timber and non-timber outputs over time. All management inputs which are time and expense and outputs which are timber volumes and revenues are being recorded. As data are collected from sites, knowledge of the application of CCF systems can be improved.

I wish the Minister of State the best of luck in that regard. What I hear is recognition of the fact that continuous cover forestry has a real role to play, but in marginal conservative research on native forestry and not necessarily on the scale in respect of which I believe there is potential. This is a moment of real change. We should surely have learned in the past 30 or 40 years that much of the forestry we had planted - it is nothing against the people involved - was on the wrong land and in the wrong location. Minimum services were provided. Effectively, we were foresting to receive grants rather than thinking long-term, which is what one must do in forestry. At a time when the level of afforestation must jump, we need to change. It is important that the Government give a clear sense that the mainstay approach will be towards continuous cover forestry and that the entire support system will work to that end. When we look at such continuous cover forests in Germany or Switzerland - I have seen examples in Ireland where Sitka spruce forests have been planted in this way - they end up with an incredibly vibrant and valuable forest where the value of the output is ten times what we are getting from lower grade fast growth wood. Will the Minister of State make the big strategic leap tomorrow and state we will go with this scale rather than just a research project?

The Deputy is right in that it is necessary to do research and trialling. There are sites that will be supported as part of ongoing research. There are disadvantages from the perspective of the whole economic prospect of the industry if one is going to develop a whole forest sector at national level. Some 12,000 jobs are supported by the industry. We have some significant investment from the processors. The size of the product that comes out of a continuous cover forest is not attractive to them. It is not something they can use significantly. It has a place, but I do not think it is it going to replace the existing afforestation programme. People would not have seen any role for agroforestry a few years ago. Native woodlands schemes were on somebody's wish list, but now they have come to be. We have to look at it as part of the overall afforestation landscape, but not as an either-or.

The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has opposed my view of economics in his climate paper. I fundamentally challenge his economics and one of the ways in which I would challenge it is that we are not thinking long term. If we go the direction the Minister of State is suggesting, where this is just a minor research project and a couple of sites will do and where we are going to massively increase our afforestation, then we are committing for the next 40 years to another whole round of clear-felling, where we are just taking land, pumping up the forest as best we can, clear-felling it and starting again. We will end up with soil degradation and it will have an effect on our water supply. It is not a viable long-term project. One has to think long-term in forestry. It is right for us to think long-term now and say we will think of the world in 30 or 40 years' time. The Minister of State said people involved in the lumber industry do not like the forest project because it is too big and not easy to do for the low-cost forestry outputs they are currently processing. Think differently and of what we are going to be looking for in 30 or 40 years' time. We will be using wood in a completely different way. It will be a highly valuable. It is right for us to plant now with a view to what the world will be like in 2060, 2070, 2080 and 2090. That is the economic vision we have to come to if we are going to manage climate change. It has to be a long-term vision, not a short-term business as usual approach, which is what we are going to do in forestry and is not the right business approach.

C16 is the structural grade standard that is needed for the construction sector. That is structural timber, which is renewable and an alternative to concrete and steel. New, advanced cross-lamination and other technologies are being developed to strengthen such structures so buildings of a higher height and with greater load-bearing can be constructed from timber. There is the forest floor, with the brash and everything else, being used in biomass. There is a renewable source. It is like saying a cow produces milk every day. She also produces calves and, at the end of her time, she produces some leather. It is renewable, and there is a commercial aspect to it. That is not a sin. It is part and parcel of any system we try to make. We are going to use 2.7 megatonnes in land-use options as part of the EU Effort Sharing Decision with regard to our carbon mitigation. That is a percentage of what our 2005 emissions were on new plantations. I think 3.5 million or 4.5 million tonnes of carbon a year can be sequestered and stored in our post-1990 plantations. There is much going on there, and continuous cover forestry is part of it, but it is not at the expense of it either. We are trying to get 18% and we want another 45,000 ha in the next five years.

According to kildarestreet.com, he has used the word sustainable 328 times in the Dáil in the last year alone, surpassed only by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, is in third place for the use of the phrase "carbon neutrality". He is doing well. In December, I asked the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, to define both terms, and he could not. The definition ultimately approved for carbon neutrality with regard to agriculture will have to be robust on scientific, technical and environmental grounds. In his explanation of the phrase "sustainable food production means", he used the word sustainable to define it. I would appreciate it if the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, could answer my question without using either of the terms this time.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	206	If I use the term as frequently as the Deputy attributes it to me, and I do not doubt that - I have no doubt his researchers do great work, and kildarestreet.com is such a reputable source of information - I would say to the farming industry outside to take a bow, because it very seldom gets the credit for the work that it puts in and its commitment to reaching the new standards and measures that will be required of it in delivering a more sustainable agricultural product. My Department is committed to ensuring that the agriculture sector continues to grow sustainably so that Ireland can play its part in meeting the increasing global food demand while having regard to Ireland’s environmental obligations. It is independently and internationally recognised that Ireland’s grass-based systems are very resource-efficient food production systems. As our largest indigenous industry, it is hugely important that we ensure the continued development of our agrifood sector. Notwithstanding, there are background challenges to producing more sustainably while safeguarding our biodiversity, maintaining water quality and mitigating our emissions. Food Wise 2025, which has superseded Food Harvest 2020, sets out a cohesive, strategic plan for the sustainable development of the agrifood sector over the next decade. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  Sustainability was the brief for one of the five core subgroups of the Food Wise 2025 committee. The projections in the report focus on the value of exports and production, rather than simply production increases and were developed giving full recognition that there is increasing pressure on global agricultural resources and the environment.  Food Wise 2025 includes clear and comprehensive commitments to managing the projected growth in the sector in a sustainable way. There are 60 individual actions related to sustainability which aim to allow the sector to reach its growth potential, while protecting and improving the environment, by managing finite resources in the most efficient and effective manner. In order to ensure that environmental considerations were at the heart of Food Wise 2025, an environmental analysis, which represented both a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment, was conducted in tandem with the development of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. This analysis was carried out by an independent team of consultants and involved stakeholder and public consultation throughout the process and my Department chaired a steering group with representatives from Teagasc, the EPA and Bord Bia to oversee the process.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The analysis included a particular focus on environmental parameters, biodiversity, climate change and water quality and sets out a range of mitigating actions. There is a strong commitment in the report to measurement and monitoring the sustainability credentials of the sector. As part of the implementation phase of Food Wise, the environmental sustainability committee was established. My Department is working closely with relevant actors to ensure appropriate monitoring across all sectors of the agrifood industry on the environmental impacts of the strategy. This implementation process includes evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and the mitigation actions. Meeting annual mitigation targets in the second half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision, which does not take into account the limited cost-effective mitigation options available in the sector, will be one of the more significant challenges for the sector. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has projected that Ireland will fall short of its 2020 target. The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 and the national mitigation plan, which is currently being prepared. Ireland has adopted a whole of Government approach to developing climate policy. Officials from my Department continue to work with other Departments and have extensively engaged with the Commission in order to ensure that EU climate and food policies to 2030 and beyond recognise the reality of these global challenges.

He used the words "sustainable" and "carbon neutral", even though he never defined them with regard food production. He regularly uses the words "sustainable growth" but this is not defined either. A chapter of the national mitigation plan, entitled An Approach to Carbon Neutrality for Agriculture, Forest and Land Use Sectors, refers to the need to focus on balancing the control of agricultural emissions with the economic and social objective of promoting the sustainable development of a rural economy. It states also that in aiming to achieve this balance, and in keeping with the high level objective set out in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, sustainable food production should not be compromised. In plain English, does this not mean that the Minister knows that emissions will increase but that he is putting short-term economic objectives before the preservation of the future of the human race? Is that not true?

We have few natural resources and one of the great natural resources we have is grass. A grass-based production system is the most carbon-efficient way to produce dairy or beef. If one looks at those two sectors in particular, we are the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy on the planet. New Zealand and Ireland are the most carbon-efficient. In the European Union, we are the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef. The logic of what the Deputy is saying is that we should dismantle our natural advantages in having a sustainable production system, and bear this in mind with regard to our competitor countries on the market. I know the Deputy has a jaundiced view of the market but he was in it himself once upon a time. In the Netherlands, for example, a premium is paid for cows that are outside for a couple of hours a day. Ours are outside 24-7, for almost 365 days a year.That is because our system is sustainable. Deputy Wallace made reference to Food Wise 2025. I chair the implementation committee of that on a monthly basis, and in fact I chaired a session of it today, when we had the dairy industry in to discuss the area of infant formula. One of the critical elements of that industry is its badge of sustainability. It is fully signed up members of the orange and green project, for example, which is committed to meeting the highest standards of sustainability because that is what the consumer and retailers want and what Irish farmers are responding to. I appreciate that Deputy Wallace and I engage in what may be called a "dialogue of the deaf" but I am anxious that people know the bone fides
of Irish agriculture, what it has achieved to date and what it is committed to achieving. It is unfair to our agricultural industry to repeatedly, and without foundation, point the finger at it as if it was a blackguard in terms of the environmental challenge we face. It is up for the battle. It has done an awful lot to date and is committed to meeting the requirements that we face. The challenges that we face are two-fold, as recognised in the Paris Accord. They include a growing global population and climate change and reducing our carbon. We have a food production system that is carbon efficient and will become more efficient.

Methane from cows and other animals is problematic. I do not want to demolish farming in Ireland.

I come from a farming background, in case it is forgotten, and I know a bit about farming.

We have a problem in the area. I disagree with serious expansion, and I do not agree with increasing the dairy herd by 50%, which will lead to an increase in the beef herd. We cannot have milk without calves. Forgetting about the environment for a moment, from an economic point of view we know for a fact that Britain will import more cheap beef from Brazil. It is not as good as ours but it will be very cheap. The harvest will be gone. We are looking for trouble in over producing beef. I am not seeking to diminish, but I want us to stop increasing production and causing extra problems, especially around emissions. What is the Minister's response to An Taisce's statement on this? It states:Like Food Wise 2025, the strategic environmental assessment is extremely lacking in quantification of baseline data or of any projections compared to a baseline. Specifically, no baseline emission data to air or water was provided for the agricultural sector, which would be essential for proper assessment of the cumulative pollutant impacts on the atmosphere and waterways resulting from the greatly increased ruminant production and fertilizer use.

Can the Minister update the House on those increased restrictions? Does the Minister accept that it has been having an impact on live exports of cattle to Northern Ireland, particularly in border marts? Can the Minister update us on whether or not the Department has resolved IT issues which meant that the data on display in marts did not properly reflect whether or not an animal had been at a mart within the previous 29 days and therefore was ineligible for live export to Northern Ireland?

I would like to wish him well during his presidency. It is a requirement under EU law that cattle exported from Ireland within the EU (including to Northern Ireland) must complete a residency period on a holding prior to export.  The animal must have been resident on this holding within 29 days of moving to an assembly centre for export.  Subsequent to moving from the holding, an animal may move one time through a mart and-or one time through a dealer’s holding, in that order.  No further moves are permitted.  The Department’s AIM computer system carries out verification checks on compliance with the residency requirement.  Cattle presented for export that do not meet the eligibility requirements are rejected by the system.  A small number of minor technical and other anomalies that were highlighted by exporters in relation to the operation of the AIM verification have been addressed, and the new arrangements are operating with minimal disruption. I called a meeting with live exporters last month at which I stressed that my Department considers the live export sector to be of great importance, particularly given Brexit and the expansion of the dairy herd. Earlier this year, I reduced the veterinary inspection fees payable on live exports of younger bovines in order to remove the disproportionate impact of these fees on exports of calves relative to older animals.   The ongoing search for new third country markets is a priority for my Department, and last month I outlined a plan to increase international market access for Irish food and drink exports. I welcome the fact that exports of live cattle to date in 2017 have increased by 40% compared to the same period last year.

It was a competitive election, fought by Ms Odile Evans as well. I wish Mr. Healy very well for his term ahead, and I have no doubt it will be successful. I also commend his predecessor, Mr. Seán Finan, for his term as well. I ask the Minister to be absolutely clear as to whether the data on recent movements and on whether an animal is eligible for live exports is available on mart boards from the Department. There has been an issue for farmers who were buying animals in marts after this restriction was brought in where the information available from the Department to the mart was not showing the fact that an animal may have been in another mart within the previous 30 days. It was only after those animals were bought and went through the veterinary checks that it was discovered that they were not eligible. That was creating a real difficulty. Can the Minister please clarify if that has now been resolved?

The issues were rectified and, following the issue of new trader notices, the check was switched on again on AIM on 3 April. Apart from some complaints in January, from some marts and some dealers and exporters about lack of notice, little feedback has been received from the industry regarding any negative effect of the new check on the 30-day requirements on exports to Northern Ireland since then. Last month, I met people involved in live exports to Northern Ireland and further afield and we had a very useful and frank discussion. This issue came up and I understood that, while it had caused problems in the past, the issues were now substantially resolved and I have not had any further contact on the matter. The level of exports, and the substantial increase in exports of both calves and older animals, are to be welcomed.

I welcome the fact that live exports are up this year and I welcome the reduction by the Minister of veterinary fees on calves. Given the success of that, I suggest the Minister look at removing the veterinary fee altogether as it is a barrier and an additional cost to live exports. It is important that live exports are there as an alternative and to ensure there is competition in the market and such a move would encourage it. It is in the Minister's power to do this. As regards movements through marts, to qualify for the quality assurance bonus under the QPS system in factories, animals have had to spend a minimum of 70 days on the most recent farm and are restricted to a maximum of four movements. That has impacted on mart trade so could the Minister look at the issue? It is not a necessary requirement but it does make it more difficult for cattle going through marts, as well as ruling them out of the QPS bonus.

A review has been carried out recently by Bord Bia of the eligibility criteria for quality assurance payments and this should make it administratively easier for farmers but a lot of quality assurance payments are driven by retail and consumer demands over food safety. I do not have any plans to revisit the fees on exports. It is reasonable that the Department should seek to recover its veterinary costs by way of a fee. We have an avenue for consultation with live exporters and it is an industry in regard to which we are obliged, for many reasons such as animal welfare and market demands, to operate to the highest standards. I am pleased to say that those involved in the live export trade do not just meet EU requirements but EU-plus requirements.

We never needed the quality assurance scheme as much as we need it now. To encourage farmers to participate fully in the scheme, all animals which come from a quality assured farm should receive some level of bonus. At the moment the scheme is restricted to certain grades of animals that are slaughtered. McDonalds uses the quality assurance scheme to advertise its food and it creates a huge boost to its sales but the farmer who sells that quality assured beef receives no bonus. It is time all animals from a quality assured farm qualified for some bonus under the scheme.

I take note of what the Deputy says, however, and I will bear it in mind.

I have spoken to the Minister on several occasions on this. I reckon money will be left over from Pillar 2 that will not be spent on other schemes so, if there is a surplus, will the Minister consider €300 per cow up to the first 30 cows, in line with our policy of at least €200 per cow up to the same limit?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	239	Ireland has supported the greater market orientation of the CAP over recent reforms, including by the decoupling of payments from production, because farmers' freedom to respond to the demands of the market is vital for the long-term development of the sector, as set out in Food Wise 2025. This approach to the reform of the CAP was recognised as being the most suitable approach to take, on the basis that the best interests of farmers were served by allowing them the flexibility to calibrate production to market demand without compromising income from the basic payment scheme.  Any provision of coupled support for suckler farmers under Pillar 1 would require a redistribution of direct payments between farmers and this would involve a linear cut across payment to all BPS beneficiaries. It would also require beneficiaries to maintain animals in order to obtain the premium, even in circumstances where supply and demand factors were exerting downward pressure on prices. There is also some evidence to suggest that the necessity to keep animals to obtain a premium had a negative impact on quality, with the focus turning to farming the premium.  These are issues that were well rehearsed in the run-up to the last and previous CAP reforms, and while there are counter arguments, on balance the judgment was that payments should be decoupled from production.  In relation to funding under Pillar 2 of the CAP, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is the current main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some €300 million of funding over the next six years. I will continue to support this programme through the lifetime of the current rural development programme, RDP. However, any increase in the payment under the BDGP would require approval from the European Commission. This would be extremely difficult in the context of an innovative scheme which has undergone an approval process relatively recently. Even if it were possible to obtain such approval, it would be necessary to require farmers to undertake additional actions to justify any additional payment, and it would make the scheme more complex and compliance more difficult. On 13 April, I announced that the beef data and genomics programme will be reopened to beef suckler farmers who are not already part of the scheme. This scheme, BDGP II, will also provide for six years of payments to farmers for completion of actions which deliver accelerated genetic improvement in the Irish national herd and improvement of its environmental sustainability.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Payment rates and actions for participants in BDGP II will be the same as those in the original scheme, with the exception that the training and carbon navigator actions must be completed by 31 October 2017.  I am delighted to say that provision has been made for new entrants to suckler farming in the scheme and it is these farmers who will drive the future of the national herd. Suckler farmers also receive support from a variety of other supports under the RDP, notably GLAS, ANCs and knowledge transfer groups.

The original target was 35,000 but fewer than 24,500 have signed up. Does the Minister agree that the 35,000 farmers' enrolment target is not attainable and an underspend is going to happen? This is the money which I reckon will be left over. The beef industry is the cornerstone of Irish agriculture. It employs more people than any other sector and is worth over €2 billion a year. Ireland's best asset for beef production is our 1.1 million beef cow herd, kept on approximately 75,000 farms. The genomics money is not going to be used as it is not reaching its target.The Minister is going to open it again; it is still not reaching it. I gave the figures, showing that it is behind. I believe money will be left over. We want to use up all this money and we want to keep this vital industry alive. The only way we can keep it alive is by direct payments. The average beef suckler herd would be 22. If the Minister looked at providing €200 for the first 30 cows with the money that is left over, it would go a long way to help the beef farmer and keep the beef industry alive.

Virtually every week I meet suckler farmers who tell me they will not be able to keep going. Veterinary costs have risen considerably, and red tape and regulations are affecting them. Those people are producing top-class stock and we need to keep them. Considering the good work the Minister is doing on the export trade, we need all those cattle, but they need to be of good quality. Deputy Aylward's question is very relevant. We do not want to lose those good breeders from the system.

However, unfortunately there are no easy answers. Under the rural development programme, while we have reopened BDGP, we will spend all of the €300 million. Not only will we spend all the €300 million under BDGP, we will spend the entire envelope under the rural development programme. That gives rise to very interesting challenges in the context of the Deputies' proposal. There is no easy way out of this. Irrespective of whether it is €200 for every cow or the tapered programme involving the first 30 cows, it has to come from some other area of funding. If they are serious about this, they need to either identify the schemes they want to close off in order to fund it or they need to come out straight and say they want to take from the basic payments of hill sheep farmers, organic farmers-----

I would not lightly propose such a linear cut. The Deputy knows the difficulty we face in getting a linear cut in respect of the national reserve for new entrants.

Alternatively the Deputy may be proposing an Exchequer-funded scheme. That funding is not there but we then run into state-aid rules.

The negotiations may take a year or two years and the beef sector will be hardest hit, especially the suckler herd. Teagasc has advised that €4.50 per kg is needed for the survival of the beef industry here. At the moment one would be lucky to get €4 for top quality beef - €3.80 or €3.75 is typical - leaving us short. The beef industry will not survive without some direct payments for it. The genomics programme is not working. It is half way there but it is not achieving the target the Minister is setting. The Minister has to look at this other thing.

However, by and large people who might know better than both of us would not support a coupled payment that would incentivise numbers rather than incentivise quality. I am serious about this. If the Deputy is proposing this in a rational economic way, he has to face up to the fact that there is no headroom in the rural development programme and the only way to fund it is by cutting the basic payment of other farmers and that is not feasible.

There is no point in incentivising overproduction. The definition of sustainable is "able to be maintained at a particular level without causing damage to the environment". In 2013 the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made efforts to block a ban on pesticides within the EU, linked to the collapse in the bee population in Europe. After a meeting with a delegation from Monsanto was arranged in September 2016 at Monsanto's request, the Minister also reversed his Department's July 2016 decision that Ireland would prohibit all pre-harvest use of glyphosate on food crops and allow it only for weed control in non-food crops. Has the Department carried out any environmental impact assessments to support these decisions?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	258	A delegated Act has been recently adopted by the EU Commission which proposes 14 changes pertaining to the basic payment and greening schemes. This Act is currently with the European Parliament for review. This legislative process was commenced to try to reduce the complexity of regulations for farmers and to make schemes less bureaucratic and more streamlined to administer. As part of this Act the Commission has introduced a proposal to ban the use of plant-protection products on ecological focus areas. In Ireland this proposed ban would relate to land lying fallow, catch crops and nitrogen-fixing crops. This ban has been opposed by Ireland along with 18 other member states. For my Department, the main concern relates to nitrogen-fixing crops and specifically beans, a substantial number of which are grown in the Deputy's constituency. In effect, the proposed ban would make it more difficult for growers to produce an economically viable crop of beans. In addition, farmers growing beans but not using beans as part of their ecological focus area would not be subject to this proposed ban. Potentially we could therefore have two standards for growing the crop within the State with attendant issues relating to scheme controls. Fundamentally, the simplification process was not intended to place an increased burden on farmers and administrators. My Department's view is that this proposal would lead to such an increased burden. It is important to clarify that the current cross-compliance rules that relate to the use of plant-protection products ensure that such products are used correctly on all crops. My Department ensures compliance with these regulations by means of regular notifications to farmers, such as the recently published cross-compliance booklet, and by means of on-farm inspection.

He is making Monsanto's argument there. He can do it any way he likes, but we are reneging on our environmental responsibilities. The scale and intensity of fertiliser, herbicide and pesticide use in the EU's arable farming sector has resulted in extensive biodiversity loss, water pollution and soil degradation in many parts of Europe. Under the ecological focus area scheme, Europe's farmers were obliged to dedicate a minimum of 5% of their arable space to EFAs. The Minister is now arguing nonsensically that these areas may be sprayed with pesticides and herbicides even though the whole point of the EFA scheme was to ensure that at least some area of land was free of these intensive farming practices and chemicals. I do not know how the Minister can make that argument. Why did they come up with the 5% scheme in the first place, if we are going to ignore it? We are not putting by 5% of land that is free of these chemicals. At the behest of Monsanto, we are saying, "Ah, we'll ignore it and keep going. As long as Monsanto keeps making money, sure it'll be all grand."

The Deputy should bear this in mind given what he said about sustainability.We are a net importer of protein crops and beans are one of the areas in which we can cultivate a protein crop as an import substitute. Bear in mind that we import very substantial amounts because we are a net importer, particularly for the ruminant feed business. What this proposal would result in is an undermining of the commercial viability of our own protein crops and a situation whereby two sets of regulations would apply, one for ecologically-focused areas and a different set for the non-ecologically-focused area. It is nonsensical. For that reason, it has been opposed by not just Ireland but by 18 other member states. There is a certain logic to it.

The Minister is moving the goalposts and defining the rules drawn up by the EU. Putting aside protecting even 5% of our land, is it a fact that according to the 2016 assessment of the EPA, agriculture was responsible for 53% of river pollution. That is mostly due to chemicals and fertilisers. We can ignore this and ignore what is coming down the tracks. We can ask what is economically viable and what is good for us economically, see where the money is, all get richer and all be grand. However, there is another day and a future ahead of us which we are ignoring. I do not describe myself as a mad green. I am at least as interested in farming as the Minister. I believe we should make sure that farming will be a powerful industry in this country in the years ahead. I want to enhance it and strengthen it in a way that will not damage the environment at the same time. That is all.

I have dealt with that issue. It is illogical to go about the objective they seek to pursue here in the manner they are pursuing it. What it would mean is that our protein crops would be made so unmanageable that we would effectively have to get out of that area. We would be then more dependent on imported proteins with a far higher carbon footprint.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	268	Free trade agreements are very important to Ireland, given our status as a small, open exporting economy. The negotiation of access to new markets historically has been a big driver of economic development, particularly in the food sector. I believe that this will continue to be the case in the future, and will be crucial to the achievement of the objectives outlined in Food Wise 2025. Canada is a sizeable market with high purchasing power and is the most developed economy with which the EU has negotiated a free trade agreement so far. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada will restore the level playing field for European businesses in Canada in comparison to Canada’s North American Free Trade Agreement partners, who have benefitted from preferential treatment in Canada since 1994. In relation to seafood, I am satisfied that CETA represents an overall balanced agreement.  Both the EU and Canada will fully eliminate all tariffs on seafood products. Some 76.4% of Canada’s imports from the EU already enjoy a most favoured nation tariff of 0%, and Canada agreed to eliminate the remaining tariffs upon entry into force of CETA. The EU agreed to eliminate 95.5% of its tariffs on these products upon entry into force of CETA and 4.5% of the tariffs within three, five or seven years. In 2016, Ireland exported €4.2 million worth of seafood to Canada, while we imported €2.5 million.  With the elimination of tariffs, there is an opportunity for Ireland’s seafood producers to further develop exports to Canada.  In relation to lobster, I understand almost all lobster caught by Ireland’s inshore fishermen are exported to EU markets.  The market price is thus likely to continue to be determined by EU markets.  I understand that buyers recognise lobster of EU origin as a separate and higher-value seafood product than Canadian or US lobster.  CETA is unlikely to affect this price differential.  In relation to scallop, I understand that prices vary from one year to the next depending on world production.  World demand has been growing in recent years, particularly in Asia, and that growth has been forecast to continue.  In those circumstances, market prices for scallop should remain healthy.

A zero-tariff regime on the importation of lobster from Canada will directly impact Irish fisherman in terms of the prices they can achieve for lobster. If the amount of lobster being imported into the EU increases significantly because the price is reduced, it will have an effect on the prices fishermen can achieve for their catches. I would love to see how the Minister can justify the assertion that it will not have any impact on prices when the logic is that it will increase supply from that market. Currently, Canada does not import lobster into the EU because of the tariffs. With the removal of the tariffs, a huge market will open up for Canada. In many cases, given that the purchase of food is price-driven, the market share that Canada will achieve will be driven by price. I would love to see what the Minister's justification is for it not having any impact.

Balanced and negotiated trade agreements have benefitted us enormously. The market access we have got as part of EU membership has been enormously beneficial to us. Therefore, I am in favour of trade agreements in principle. The devil is in the detail. The global demand for seafood is almost insatiable. Market demand for the high-quality seafood that our industry is capable of meeting will always deliver a reasonable price. Obviously, trade is a two-way street. There are opportunities in the context of any trade agreement for the trade partner also. There is already trade between Ireland and Canada and there are opportunities for us now in the context of that trade agreement to increase our foothold in Canadian markets. There are also opportunities for Canadians to come in this direction. I have no doubt, given our marketing operations, the commitment of our industry to a high-quality product and the commitment of organisations like Bord Bia, that we can navigate a successful outcome to this. In the context of trade agreements, as part of the continuing efforts of my Department in terms of market access opportunities, I will be going on a trade mission to the US and Canada next month. I have no doubt that seafood will be an important element of that. We cannot say we are in favour of all of the things we get in other markets but that we do not want anybody coming into our market. That is contrary to the spirit of trade agreements.

Like everyone else, I was taken aback by the announcement at the weekend that the remaining 16 beds would be closed at the unit as a result of staff shortages. The way it was announced on the eve of a bank holiday weekend was an attempt to bury the story in the hope it might just go away. Families were contacted last Thursday and Friday and told the unit was closing with immediate effect. The 16 beds closed comprised 11 rehab beds, three long-stay beds and two respite beds. This unit provides vital rehab services and physiotherapy for people recovering from stroke and accident, allowing patients to convalesce on a short-term basis. The importance of the two respite beds cannot be underestimated with families availing of these vital services two weeks of the year when their loved ones get excellent care and the carers get a much needed break. These facilities are a key factor in dealing with overcrowding in our acute hospitals. If we see further reduction in capacity in places such as Dungarvan, how can we possibly deal with the overcrowding in UHW and our other acute hospitals? The hospital in Dungarvan is a vital step-down unit. In January 2017, seven beds were closed in the unit and the closure of the 16 remaining beds is a major blow to Dungarvan and west Waterford. Family members of patients contacted me at the weekend because they are deeply concerned about where their loved ones will be moved to. The unit allowed people from the west Waterford area to stay close to their families. One of the issues cited was a shortage of nurses, which is now at critical stage. There are issues with nursing recruitment and retention but not letting those who will be directly affected by a decision to close know in advance has resulted in serious disturbance and upset among patients, families, staff and the wider community.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	279	Ar an gcéad dul síos, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this Topical Issue this evening. It is a very important issue. The Minister has been down to Cashel in Tipperary. He saw the wonderful unit in the old Our Lady's which is lying idle; €23 million was spent on it and there is not a bed inside it. There are managers galore but not a bed. The Minister told me he would do something, yet he has done nothing. Deputy Butler lives in Dungarvan and I am 20 miles away in Newcastle. South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel is in the middle of the two, about 20 miles from each place. It is unbelievable. There is bedlam every day of the week on the corridors. It is a retrograde step. It is only an excuse for the HSE to say it cannot get nurses. There are plenty of managers there to get nurses. They have had plenty of time to get them. The HSE is telling us this is only temporary in the Sacred Heart in Dungarvan and in Cashel. We lost a ward in Cashel already when it was transferred to the back of Our Lady's. We lost 12 respite beds for women when that transfer occurred. We hoped it would be a modern, new facility, which it is, but we lost 12 respite beds in the system in south Tipperary. Many of the people in west Waterford come to Clonmel and Ardkeen. They get their procedures in Clonmel under awful pressure. They cannot be released because there is no place to which to be discharged. This is total madness. Is the Minister going to allow himself to be captured by the officials? I do not say that lightly. I wished the Minister well in his position but the officials are ruling the roost and doing a damn bad job of it. The Minister can smile all he likes. Closing respite beds is madness; it contributes to the problem. There is a wonderful facility in the Sacred Heart in Dungarvan and a wonderful facility in St Patrick's in Cashel under Mary Prendergast, who is doing her best. Officialdom is ruling the roost. There are dozens of officials in the new hospital where €21 million was spent but not a bed. It is a bed-free zone and a patient-free zone. The Minister said he would do something about it but he has done nothing. It will cause chaos coming into summer. It will cause absolute chaos when it comes to the winter because these beds in Dungarvan have been lost and we will lose 15 to 18 further respite beds on top of the 12 we have lost already in St Patrick's in Cashel. Where have people to go? Will they go on the streets or the roads? This is pathetic. It is ineptitude by the HSE. It is scandalous. Temporary measures will not work because they are not temporary. Nothing is temporary with the HSE. The only thing permanent with the HSE are the managers and lazy bureaucracy.

The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This is clearly what older people and everybody in this House wants. We also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care either on a long-stay or short-stay basis. The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Dungarvan Community Hospital and St Patrick's community nursing unit in Cashel. Both hospitals provide long-stay residential, respite, palliative care and rehabilitation services for older people. As with the health service In general, Dungarvan Community Hospital and St. Patrick’s, Cashel are experiencing significant challenges with recruiting and retaining nursing staff. Dungarvan has 16 whole-time equivalent vacancies, eight of which are required for the Sacred Heart ward. St. Patrick's has vacancies for ten whole-time equivalents. While there have been a number of national recruitment campaigns for nurses, unfortunately a serious challenge has arisen in recruiting nurses to fill vacancies in these facilities. These two examples in Dungarvan and Cashel highlight the absolute importance of ensuring we hire the 1,208 more nurses we are fully funded to hire this year. Nurses, through their representative bodies, the INMO and SIPTU, voted overwhelmingly a number of weeks ago to accept the proposals we put in place. I will be talking to the INMO at its annual conference tomorrow about how we turn the plan into absolute action so that facilities like this can be adequately staffed because this is a very acute problem. As a result of the nurse recruitment shortages, in order to maintain the delivery of safe, high quality services in compliance with standards and the laws of the land to look after people, which is what is most important, the HSE has decided to move residents internally from the Sacred Heart ward to alternative accommodation within Dungarvan Community Hospital and to amalgamate wards within St. Patrick's. This is a temporary measure and staff will be reorganised to optimise patient safety. Long-stay and short-stay care, including palliative and dementia care all continue to be provided. I assure Deputies Butler and McGrath there is no decision in any way, shape or form to close these facilities or beds. It is a short-term measure whilst recruitment is under way. I say that on the record of the House to give assurances to the people of Dungarvan and the people of Cashel and beyond on this. It is a staffing shortage that we are determined to fix so these beds can reopen. I understand the decision has caused a great deal of upset for residents, families and the local community. I hope further clarity has been and will continue to be brought to the situation by the HSE. I fully accept the point made by Deputies Butler and McGrath about the panic, upset and confusion it caused over the bank holiday weekend.

Both of these facilities are held in high esteem. The HSE acknowledges the concerns expressed on this subject in recent days and apologises to residents and their families for any inconvenience and will work to ensure there is minimum disruption to normal services during this interim arrangement. It is important to note there is no negative impact on existing staffing numbers whilst this interim safety arrangement is in place at both hospitals. Representatives of hospital management are available at all times to residents and their families to discuss any matters of concern to them. They assure me they will continue to work closely with staff representatives to bring both units back to full operating capacity. My Department will monitor the situation carefully and I have asked the HSE to keep me directly updated on progress. Another factor that has contributed to the temporary closure in St. Patrick's is the structural issues associated with the building, which I acknowledge do not meet the standards one would expect to find in a modem nursing home. Deputy McGrath and I have discussed this before. A replacement for St. Patrick's is, like Dungarvan, included in the five-year capital investment programme for public nursing homes announced last year.

The trend of nurses leaving Ireland has become very worrying. Terms and conditions for new graduates must be improved to ensure that they stay here. The Minister mentioned that he will be attending an INMO conference tomorrow. Last week, that organisation published research showing that upwards of 85% of all soon-to-graduate nursing students are contemplating going overseas to work rather than staying in the Irish health system. Coupled with that is the length of time it takes for nurses who return home to work to be registered with An Bord Altranais, an issue I have raised with the Minister previously. Such registration can take up to 90 days and I know of one nurse who actually gave up and went back to England. I am glad that the Minister has asserted that this is a temporary rather than a permanent measure and I will be holding him to account on that. This is a vital service for the people of Dungarvan and west Waterford.

He has said that this is temporary but nobody trusts the HSE. This is a case of sheer ineptitude on the part of senior management in the HSE. A blind woman or man could see that this was coming. The services did not have enough staff and were under chronic pressure. I want to pay tribute to the staff in both facilities for the fabulous work they do and for the excellent treatment they give to patients. Nobody told me, as a public representative, about this. A patient's family phoned me and when I phoned the HSE, they said that they were going to tell me. This is nothing but subterfuge and deceit on the part of senior HSE management who do not care. They do not care about the patients. I know that the Minister means what he says but the HSE managers do not mean it. They go off on their holidays, tours and trips. They saw this coming and now the hospital in Clonmel will be totally swamped, as will University Hospital Waterford. Clonmel will be totally swamped and when winter comes, God help us. The Minister was there, he saw the facilities and rubbed his hands. He is still rubbing his hands but nothing has been done; rather, this is going to make a bad situation worse. I am glad that the Minister has said that money will be invested as part of the five-year programme because we need new beds in St. Patrick's. Will it happen, though? We will hold the Minister to account. Finally, I ask the Minister to receive Ms Twomey at his office this evening to bring the current stand-off to an end. I asked him to do so earlier today, as did many other Deputies. The Minister should meet her for five minutes. He should have the good grace to inform her of the current situation.

I want to begin by letting both Deputies and all Oireachtas Members and public representatives in Waterford and Tipperary know that I am not satisfied with the lack of communication by the HSE on this issue.

Patients are of paramount importance. It is very important that the truth is put out there in a factual way. I know that there was a concern in both communities that these facilities were shutting but this is only a temporary measure. It makes sense to brief people and keep them factually aware of the situation so that myths and misinformation do not spread. In terms of nurses, I fully agree with Deputy Butler. Obviously, we will have the public service pay commission report shortly. That is a broader process and one for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but that will provide an avenue for discussion. We have just agreed a number of exciting proposals with the INMO and SIPTU to help to recruit and retain nurses, including under the Bring Them Home campaign. Nurses were offered €1,500 to move back from the UK to Ireland and that sum has now been doubled to €3,000 and it does not just apply to the UK anymore. We also have a number of pre-retirement initiatives to enable older nurses who may wish to stay on and work part time rather than full time to do so without negatively impacting their pension entitlements. Deputy Butler is right about the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, registration process. I recently visited the NMBI's offices. The board is about to go fully digital which should help in making sure that the organisation is not swamped. It is quite busy in terms of receiving applications but digitisation should lead to a more streamlined process. The beds provided by public nursing homes like Dungarvan Community Hospital and St. Patrick's in Cashel are an essential part of our health care infrastructure. Without them, many older people would not have access to the care that they need. However, as I said already, quality care and patient safety are priorities and all decisions must be made in the interests of patient safety. At present, these two units do not have sufficient nursing staff to safely maintain the full range of services. Therefore, the HSE is obliged to take the appropriate steps for the management of the patient profile and the staffing resources available. I reiterate that I am assured that these are temporary measures. Any decisions to close beds are taken in the interest-----

It is common practice. It happened last week and the unit could very well be closed right now, as I speak. Perhaps the Minister can understand this but I cannot. The unit was opened to alleviate pressure on the very busy emergency department in the hospital. The HSE says that the hospital is very busy so it closes the medical assessment unit and sends patients back into the emergency department. One could not make it up. Last Tuesday there were 217 patients in the emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. This was an unprecedented number but the medical assessment unit was closed. I contacted the HSE by e-mail on the Monday before last. My email was very straightforward - I asked the HSE to confirm that the medical assessment unit had been closed and to give me a reassurance that it would reopen on the following day. I got no response. I emailed the HSE again on Tuesday and Wednesday but got no response. I emailed again on Thursday but, to date, nobody has bother his or her backside to respond. That is a very serious issue and raises a number of questions. First, it raises the question of a lack of accountability within the HSE. It also raises the question of mismanagement in the context of the closure of a medical assessment unit which was opened in the first instance to alleviate pressure on the emergency department. The fact that the HSE did not respond to my emails leads me to believe that it did not want the public to know what is going on in the hospital. First, there is the issue of the medical assessment unit. Second, there is the fact that the HSE did not respond to an elected representative on four different occasions. HSE senior managers seem to believe that they are answerable to nobody and are a law unto themselves. I ask the Minister to give his opinion on that. Will the Minister be holding them to account? I want to find out who made the decision not to respond to four separate emails on a matter of great concern to patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. I also want to know why the medical assessment unit was closed given that the reason it was opened in the first place was to alleviate the pressure on the emergency department. Why is it that droves of patients are now being sent back to the emergency department?

I received an email from the Deputy earlier this week regarding the lack of a response to her queries, which is not acceptable for any public representative or citizen of this country. I will get back to the Deputy directly regarding that matter. I wish to take this opportunity to address the performance of the emergency department and the medical assessment unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. While recognising the pressures our emergency departments face, it is worth pointing out that recent data from the HSE indicates that, despite an increase of over 3% in attendances for the first quarter of 2017, the situation at the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has been improving, with 42% fewer patients waiting on a trolley compared to the same period this year. It is easy to get lost in percentages but that equates to 850 fewer patients on trolleys so far this year in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in County Louth. While there are still too many patients on trolleys, I want to acknowledge the Trojan work being undertaken by staff. Despite the fact that additional patients have attended the emergency department, 850 fewer people in that hospital have experienced being on a trolley this year as compared with last year. We need to build on that progress and I am confident that the staff there will do that. The emergency department has also seen a sustained improvement in patient experience times during this period. I am sure Deputy Munster will join me in acknowledging the great work of front-line staff and managers in driving this improved performance. I want to thank everybody at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for that.Notwithstanding this, under the framework of the HSE's full capacity protocol, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has an agreed escalation plan in place in line with national practice. This plan comes into operation during periods of emergency department overcrowding. I think this is the issue the Deputy is getting to. The plan sets out a range of special measures which can be activated through the escalation process as a last resort. These measures aim to improve the flow of admitted patients through unscheduled care pathways. As part of this, a medical assessment unit may temporarily be used to accommodate a locally agreed number of extra patients to address overcrowding. This is often referred to as surge capacity. At these times, patients are seen in the medical assessment unit rather than in the emergency department. While this temporary change of use may not be ideal in terms of the utilisation of medical assessment units, it enables hospitals to alleviate overcrowding in emergency departments and, most importantly, affords patients a greater degree of dignity. When patients are in a very overcrowded emergency department, it is important to afford them a little more dignity and privacy where possible. That is why decisions of this nature are taken. I accept that it might not always be ideal to use such additional space for these purposes. I have been advised that management in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has used the medical assessment unit facility in full accordance with the standard operating procedures as set out in the HSE's full capacity framework. I assure the Deputy that there will continue to be a strong focus on reducing overcrowding. This should result in medical assessment units being used less frequently for surge capacity purposes. My Department and the HSE are already engaged in a process of commencing planning for next year's winter period. We are continuing to build on and improve trajectory in emergency department performance. In parallel with this process, the HSE's special delivery unit continues to work closely with hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, to identify improvements that can be made to support patient flow, reduce trolley numbers and improve patients' emergency department experience. The programme for Government includes a commitment to build on the capacity for our emergency and acute services. This Government has agreed to review the management, operation and funding of medical assessment units with a view to extending their hours of opening and providing for weekend opening. My Department is in the scoping phase of this review. I hope hospitals like Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital can benefit from it. A number of major capital projects are under way to increase overall capacity in our hospitals. One such project at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital will see the construction of a ward block to accommodate a clinical decision unit. This ward block is expected to be completed later this year. I expect that this increased capacity will further reduce the need to initiate the full capacity protocol.

First, it contradicts itself. As I said, the medical assessment unit was provided to alleviate the pressures on the emergency department. The HSE has pretty much said in its response that the medical assessment unit was closed because the hospital was so busy. What sort of chaos or mismanagement is that? If it was provided to alleviate pressure on the emergency department, but management is deciding to shut it as soon as the hospital is busy, common sense will dictate that this must lead to overcrowding in the accident and emergency department. Last Tuesday week, 217 patients had to wait all day and through the night. The medical assessment unit was closed. I cannot make up my mind about whether this is happening because of chaos, mismanagement, or both. I would be interested to know whether the Minister thinks it is either or both. We have been discussing the crisis at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital for many years. This problem has been further compounded by the decision of the previous Government to remove services from the minor injuries unit of Louth County Hospital, which currently has two registrars who cannot see children under the age of 14 to deal with minor ailments they might have. The Minister has previously given us a commitment to restore those services. Can he tell us when that will happen? All of these cutbacks are compounding the crisis at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Will the Minister ask the HSE or the senior management at the hospital to give a commitment not to shut down the medical assessment unit again, as such a closure would result in a repeat of the crisis we have seen in the emergency department this week?

These are not just figures; they are real people. Compared with last year, 850 fewer of Deputy Munster's constituents have had to experience a period of time on a trolley in the hospital this year. I want to make it clear that the number of people who have had such an experience this year is still too large, but it is worth noting that there has been a reduction of 850 in that number to date this year. The figures, which are there for all to see, show that people have been able to get in and out of the hospital more quickly because of an improvement in patient experience times. There are still many challenges in our health service. If we do not stop to acknowledge instances of significant progress being made by the staff of our hospitals, what are we actually at? We need to acknowledge it when people make progress. We are making progress in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is the Deputy's local hospital. I am going to acknowledge that even if she chooses not to do so. Decisions on how best to utilise space in the medical assessment unit are best made by staff. We have a procedure in place to be followed by a clinical nurse manager, a clinical director, a doctor, a nurse or a manager who is running a hospital with a crowded emergency department. Under the procedure in question, which has been agreed with the INMO, if extra surge capacity is available to afford additional dignity and privacy to patients, that space should be used, even if it is not an ideal situation. We want to minimise the need for such arrangements by tackling overcrowding. We are going to do that by opening a new clinical decision unit. This is a tangible example of how capacity can be increased in hospitals. We are going to recruit more nurses. We have agreed with the INMO and SIPTU that an additional 1,208 nurses will be recruited this year. We will ensure there are more staff back in our hospitals. The bed capacity review will enable us to look at exactly how many beds we need. I am the first person to admit we need more beds in the Irish health service. However, beds are only good when personnel are available to staff them. I will ask the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the issue she raised with regard to Louth County Hospital, or else I will come back to her directly on the matter. I will follow up directly with the HSE to ensure the Deputy's correspondence is answered.

In fairness, the Minister responded to Deputy McGuinness and me when we raised this matter as a Topical Issue in this Chamber last year. We invited him to come down and look at the Piltown bypass, which is a section of the N24 route between Waterford city and Carrick-on-Suir, and he said he would do so. As the Minister probably knows at this stage, 15 lives have been lost on this disastrous stretch of road since it was built over a decade ago. As a member of Kilkenny County Council at the time, I told representatives of the National Roads Authority that the road was badly designed. The 2+1 design of the N24 near Piltown means there is one lane for 3 km, then it goes into two lanes and then it goes back into one lane. There is confusion. There is a wire dividing the two sides of the road. When people come to junctions, they do not know where they are. The proof of that is that there have been 15 deaths on this road since it was built. If one goes down to the Piltown bypass, one will see 15 big crosses that have been erected by local people on the side of the road to commemorate the deaths that have taken place and to mark the worst piece of engineering they have ever seen. Local people are now calling this area the "valley of death". I have raised this issue previously on Topical Issues. I have submitted written questions to the county council, the Minister and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to ask them to expedite this matter as quickly as possible. I was told that those who were carrying out a safety audit on the road would come back with a report in early 2017, but we are now into May. The last time I made a request in this regard, I was told that the report might not be available until the end of the year. This matter is dragging on and on. After a man was killed in an accident at the water tower junction near Piltown last year, 500 people turned up at the local hall for a meeting that was called by the parish priest. Since then, there have been four more non-fatal accidents at the same junction. The people of the area have come together and said that enough is enough. Between 200 and 300 people, many of them in tractors and cars, held up the traffic in the area for two hours as part of a protest that was held a fortnight ago. This shows how seriously the people of Piltown and the local area are taking this issue. I ask the Minister to expedite this matter by contacting Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the local council to try to get a result in this regard. The answer is to build an overpass that would take out the two most dangerous junctions. That would provide interim relief of the problems that exist in this locality. I hope that interconnectors will be provided in the long term as part of the development of the N24 route between Limerick and Waterford, which we were promised would be done after the motorways were completed. I ask the Minister to expedite the provision of an overpass at this dangerous junction in the interim. I will hand over to my colleagues who want to say a few words on this issue.

I live two miles from the Piltown bypass but avoid it like the plague, tending to drive the back road to Carrick-on-Suir. I am nervous of it. It is an unusual road using a two-plus-one design which makes it dangerous. When a car is overtaking, before the driver knows it, he or she will be back in a one-way scenario. I would appreciate it if the Minister could expedite the proposed safety works.

A group of Members from Kilkenny and I have already met the Minister on this and I know he is committed to visiting the road in question. It is a treacherous and exceptionally dangerous stretch of road because of the spacing between the junctions. The road barrier is a steel rope and would be lethal if one hit it. There have been 15 deaths on this road. The parish priest, members of the local community and people who have used the road to travel to Waterford have been in touch with me about it. I hope the Minister can address this issue.

I have already addressed this issue and it has been brought to the attention of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. It is aware of this issue and it is attending to it, but it is probably not fast enough for the Deputies. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network. The maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer. Due to the national financial position, there were significant reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past several years. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. The Government’s capital investment plan, Building on Recovery - Infrastructure and Capital Investment, provides the strategic and financial framework for TII’s national roads programme from 2016 to 2022. As Minister, I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan. In turn, TII has to prioritise works on the basis of the funding available to it. TII allocates funding specifically for safety works based on its analysis of the network. This year it has allocated approximately €17 million for such works. Under its HD15 programme, safety works are based on an analysis of accident density across the network. Those sections of the network with considerably higher than average accident densities are selected for analysis. Sections of road which are amenable to engineering solutions are prioritised for treatment. In addition, TII operates a HD17 programme based on road safety inspection reports. These reports indicate which issues, for example signing, lining or safety barriers, need to be addressed on different sections of road and programmes are drawn up to deal with the priority issues. It should be noted that good pavements also contribute to road safety. TII has allocated approximately €50 million for pavements in 2017. Kilkenny County Council, the road authority for the area, appointed consultants to undertake a review of the Tower Road-Piltown junction on the N24. The latest update from TII is that an allocation was approved to Kilkenny County Council for a signing and lining scheme to address issues identified by the council’s consultant in the performance of Piltown junction. In parallel, Waterford County Council’s road design office, on behalf of Kilkenny County Council, is currently preparing a preliminary appraisal examining options to close the median crossing at Tower Road junction and the possibility of providing an overbridge at this location. I am aware of the safety issues which the Deputies have raised. I am particularly anxious that safety should be the top priority in my time in this particular portfolio. I cannot emphasise more the fact that I have told TII that this is a priority. It has responded in a positive way, not necessarily to this particular junction, but to this issue in the future.

People in this area will not let go of this issue. Last Saturday week, they stopped the road for two hours. That was not done lightly as we are peaceful people in Kilkenny. We tend not to block roads unless there is a reason for it. It is welcome that signage and lining will be addressed but that will not save lives. This is a more serious problem with a small stretch of road with nine junctions off it and a two-plus-one layout. It is completely confusing. Any tourists who have passed this road have said they cannot understand how the road was designed. It was a bad design from the word go and the whole system was wrong. The overbridge with relief roads on each side to take out the two junctions where most of these 15 deaths occurred is the long-term answer. I am delighted some funding has been allocated and the Minister reminded TII that this is a priority. Life is the most important thing of all. I know there is a priority where road safety is involved. This is one of these cases where life is at risk which has been proved by the statistics to date. Road safety and saving lives is most important, a point which must be emphasised to TII. An overpass is needed for a satisfactory outcome. Paint and lining will not save lives. It may help but it is an overbridge that is needed until the new road from Limerick to Waterford is done in 15 years’ time.

This is tragic and so nakedly awful. The figure of 15 deaths is a figure upon which any Government or State agency must act. TII funding of €17 million must be spread around the network. The relative dangers of various junctions must be taken into account. It still is not acceptable that this area should go unaddressed. If the Deputies believe it would be helpful, I will visit the road. I promised Deputy Mattie McGrath to come down but I apologise for not doing so yet as it is difficult. If it is acceptable, I can meet a cross-party group from the area.

The UN describes this commission as the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. The executive director of Geneva-based UN Watch has stated that electing Saudi Arabia to protect women's rights is like making an arsonist the town fire chief. It called the appointment "absurd". We know five European countries voted for Saudi Arabia and we specifically know Belgium voted for Saudi Arabia due to a leaked cable. In the Minister's statement today, he indicated that Ireland has a very strong record in promoting the rights of women and girls at the United Nations, commanding trust and respect across the UN membership. It is an interesting statement given that last year the UN Human Rights Committee ruled that Ireland's laws prohibiting and criminalising abortion violated the human rights of Ms Amanda Mellet. The committee ruled that Ms Mellet was subjected to discrimination and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment due to Ireland's abortion laws. The same committee on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women has called for an independent investigation into Ireland's mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries, saying that victims should get appropriate compensation and official apologies. We are probably not the best to be throwing stones at anyone but Saudi Arabia is in a different league to all of us. One would struggle to find any country in the world where women are treated so poorly. Given the Minister's statement, the majority of people in Ireland would believe that diplomacy and trade interests have won out and human rights have lost. Perhaps that is not true but it would be good if the Minister could clarify the issue so we could know the truth.

It is utterly shocking if a Cabinet colleague does not know. In whose name and on whose authority was Ireland's vote made? As Deputy Wallace states, the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women. A decision has been taken to allow Saudi Arabia to sit on that body. It is a country based on male guardianship that forbids women from obtaining a passport, marrying and travelling without the approval of a male relative; if they try to do so without approval, women can end up in prison and they cannot get out without permission from the same person. In 2002, Saudi morality police blocked a rescue in a girls' school that was on fire because the girls were not wearing headscarves and black robes; 15 young women died. The Saudi Government enforces sex segregation in virtually all workplaces except hospitals and it fines businesses that do not comply. In food outlets men and women stand in separate lines and in many public buildings women are not even allowed to enter. In most places where there is segregation, women must sit down the back. As one Saudi woman has stated:the decision to allow this oppressive regime to join a commission designed to empower women makes me feel personally violated and invisible. It is demoralising for us and sends a message that for the international community, Saudi wealth and power are more important than women's lives.The Minister cannot hide behind a spurious precedent. This issue is outrageous and people have a right to know how Ireland voted.

I am a strong believer in the equal rights of women and support the role of the commission in addressing questions of gender equality. As set out in our foreign policy review, The Global Island, Ireland is committed to advancing gender equality. We played a key role in the establishment of UN Women, the UN body which promotes gender equality and which provides administrative support for the Commission on the Status of Women. Ireland took up a seat on the commission at the conclusion of this year's session for a four-year period to 2021 and we will chair the annual sessions in 2018 and 2019. During its term on the commission, Ireland has pledged to work to strengthen the voice and functioning of the commission. Next year, the commission, under our leadership, will attach particular priority to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls in particular. In 2019 our priority will be to advance equality of access to public services. I want to secure agreement on these critical issues under the Irish chairmanship. To do this we will have to work closely with all UN member states and civil society to deliver the strongest possible outcome for women and girls. I also point out that Ireland has strongly supported equal opportunity across the United Nations. In this regard, the Government was very pleased that a member of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Mary Carroll, was last year appointed the first Irish woman in command of an Irish contingent in the UN Disengagement Force in the Golan Heights. With respect to UN elections, Ireland's approach very much reflects those of other countries at the United Nations and it is an important part of how international relations are conducted. Since 1947, at the United Nations, the rules of procedure for general assembly elections provide that they are held by secret ballot. We do not publicly disclose our voting intentions or decisions. That is normal diplomatic practice and it is widely considered a fundamental aspect of the conduct of sensitive international relations. It would be very damaging to Ireland's ability to conduct international relations successfully if we were to move away unilaterally from this established practice. It would be irresponsible to abandon a practice that has been in place for over six decades, observed by all previous Governments and that is grounded on protecting and promoting the values of small countries on the world stage. This is not a practice that is specific to Ireland or to elections for the UN Commission on the Status of Women. It relates to elections to any UN body and I am not aware of any member state which, as a matter of practice, publicly reveals how it votes. It allows for the good functioning of the United Nations, which is made up of member states of very different views and political backgrounds. There are many countries in the world with which we have important policy differences, including in the area of human rights. The United Nations provides us with an important forum to discuss these differences. Our membership and leadership of the UN Commission on the Status of Women will provide us with such an opportunity. We will take that opportunity to very good effect. Ireland's engagement on human rights at international level enables us to reaffirm our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses and to the protection of those, including women and girls, who are most vulnerable and marginalised.

Only two weeks before the Irish trade delegation landed in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Ambassador to the US, Prince Abdullah bin Faisal al Saud, was asked if Saudi Arabia would continue to use cluster bombs in Yemen. His answer was short but conveyed quite a bit about the Saudi Administration. His response was, "This is like the question, will you stop beating your wife?", before he let out a big belly laugh. Prince Abdullah compared Yemen to the wife of a Saudi man and seemed to find the idea preposterous that either should stop being punished. He was referring to physical abuse in the case of women and cluster bombs in the case of the people of Yemen. The Minister states that Ireland supports equality of opportunity but the people of Ireland would like to know if we supported the opposite on this occasion. Until the Minister tells us and there is openness about the decision making - this is not a normal issue - the people will like to know the truth.

Irish people are absolutely outraged at a country that is infamous for the subjugation of women being given a position on this body. The Minister has history in this as he told us last year that he was delighted to go to Saudi Arabia to strengthen our economic, political and cultural ties with this "key" and "priority" market. It would appear from the Minister's response that markets are more important than human rights. There was no precedent in Belgium's case, and it is a small country that was able to acknowledge how it voted. The Minister's remarks today tally with those of the Taoiseach when he spoke of this State applying "moderation" in the Gulf.It is a matter of public record that Saudi Arabia has committed war crimes in Yemen, where it has dropped cluster bombs. Some 4 million Yemeni women and children are in a state of malnutrition. Saudi Arabia is a country in which there are public beheadings and floggings for crimes such as blasphemy or losing the faith. It funnels billions to ISIS. People have a right to know and the truth will out on this matter, sooner or later. The Minister might as well come clean. What way did Ireland vote?

I availed of that opportunity to raise human rights issues and, in particular, the status of women, women's rights and the importance of equality in society. The United Nations at all levels, including the Security Council and the Offices of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, conducts its most sensitive work in confidentiality. This is fundamental to the effective operation of an institution which we uphold and support. I believe in dialogue in the conduct of international relations. That is the reason I visited Saudi Arabia. It is fundamental to the effective operation of an institution such as the United Nations that matters of sensitivity are conducted in confidence. Indeed, it is fundamental to the operation of relations between states. Ireland does not propose to turn on its head a convention that has been in place since 1947. Again, I acknowledge the strong support in this House for gender equality and the protection of women's rights, two matters which lie at the root of this discussion. In fact, I am a former vice chairman of the Oireachtas women's rights committee, the only man to hold such an office. I have a strong record of promoting women's rights. Ireland has a strong a record of promoting the rights of women and girls at the United Nations. It is widely accepted that ours is a leading voice in this area. As I mentioned earlier, we will chair the UN Commission on the Status of Women over the next two years. The outcomes from that commission carry considerable moral force. Reaching consensus on subjects related to gender equality empowers advocates for the human rights of women and girls globally. It gives them a voice and a tool to hold governments to account nationally on commitments made globally. In this way the commission has an important role in achieving global gender equality. Ireland will take the opportunity to forward the gender equality agenda during our term on the commission. As she prepares to assume her role as chair of the UN Commission on the Status of Women, I am happy to ask our incoming ambassador to the UN in New York, Geraldine Byrne Nason, to engage with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence regarding Ireland's ongoing work at the United Nations on the specific matter of promoting the rights of women and girls.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	319	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." This Bill seeks to ensure that regard be had by public bodies to the desirability of reducing socioeconomic and other inequalities suffered by those in rural Ireland, to provide for the carrying out of rural impact assessments in respect of measures that are likely to have a significant socioeconomic impact or effect on rural Ireland and to provide for related matters. It is designed to ensure that the decline of rural Ireland cannot continue unabated and that any measure undertaken by a public body will have to be vetted to ensure it does not discriminate against rural areas. The programme for Government states, and it is mentioned in the Government's amendment to the Bill, that the Action Plan for Rural Development takes a whole-of-Government approach to "Develop a new and effective rural proofing model which would ensure that rural development issues are considered in the decision-making processes of all Government Departments". That is the intent behind the Bill. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, tell us how much they care about rural communities, how the recovery is going and how things are progressing. The lip-service might be very good but there is little action on the ground. Many Deputies talk about Ireland in a post-boom context, but the so-called Celtic tiger never stalked the rural land of this nation or roared in the hills and valleys of the parts of the island far removed from the big cities. A prime example of the problem is the latest proposal from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to roll out rural broadband. Nobody in country areas believes that broadband will be delivered. They simply do not believe it because of the failures and repeated broken promises of the past. The latest proposal allows the commercial service providers to cherry-pick the most desirable, accessible and thus the most profitable areas of the country to provide a service. For the rest of us, it is a case of "live horse and you'll get grass". That is the reality for most people in rural Ireland. The rural school bus service is another example. The rule introduced to provide that school bus services are to the nearest school totally disrupted a system that was working fine. It denied bus services to children all over the country. People in the Department have told me that they did not anticipate the effects this would have on rural schools and rural areas. Some children in families get the bus and others are refused because of the poorly devised rules. That is the reality for families living in rural Ireland. Another example is the ambulance service. In many rural areas the service is scant, if it is there at all. In addition, the time an ambulance has to get to an accident or incident is well outside the 19 minute target. For many it is an hour at best due to the location of the ambulance centres and the bad roads the ambulances must travel. As a result, some people with medical conditions have moved to bigger towns to be close to hospitals. That is the reality for sick people living in rural Ireland. The decision to remove cancer services from Sligo has had an impact on thousands of families. For years they have been travelling to Galway from across the north west, over long distances and on poor roads, in order to attend appointments. This health policy decision took no account of the trauma and distress its implementation would have on people living a long distance from Galway in rural areas with already poor medical services and infrastructure. The Bill would force such a policy change to be assessed against the impact it would have on people living in rural Ireland. The Government's proposed amendment seeks to block the Bill and revert to the status quo. The status quo is simply not working, as can be seen with the continual withdrawal of services, as well as post offices, hospitals and so forth. The complaint in the Government's amendment regarding the implications it would have for a money Bill is quite strange, as my proposal is to monitor the impact of existing budgets on rural areas. There was no boom in many rural areas except in property prices, which brought its own legacy of misery to many parts of the country and certainly to my native County Leitrim, which had the distinction of having more ghost estates than any other county in proportion to its size and population. It is ironic to hear people in Fianna Fáil, the overseers of the building boom, talk about Government inaction on rural Ireland. I hope the Fianna Fáil Deputies will support this Bill to ensure that the neglect they complain about so eloquently can be halted for once and for all. Yesterday, I attended the meeting of the transport committee where representatives of chambers of commerce from across the midlands and the west lobbied to have the N4 and N5 roads upgraded to motorways. The economy in that region is suffering and potential is being lost due to the disadvantage of single lane roads on these national routes. Parts of them are very dangerous. The road between Castlebaldwin and Collooney features dozens of white crosses to represent the road deaths on that stretch of narrow road. That is the reality. Another issue is the work activation schemes that are brought forward by the Government. They do not take account of people living in rural areas who have to travel long distances and the costs involved in that. The JobPath programme, which already has many problems, is a typical example. People in rural areas are expected to travel three and four times a week to JobPath centres and get no expenses for doing so. If they do not turn up, their benefits are cut. It is a process that simply does not work for people living in rural Ireland. Rural areas have been ignored for long enough. It is time to deal with this issue. During the boom, work in agriculture was regarded as a Cinderella option. It was the last option for many people when things were good. Young people left rural areas to seek high technology jobs in cities or abroad. There are very few such jobs for graduates in rural areas because businesses do not have the infrastructure to locate outside the big cities. The farming community has seen the cycle of boom and bust previously and is experienced, over generations of resilience on the land, in persevering through tough times and coming out the other side. The policy of afforestation in rural Ireland is destroying rural communities because when large tracts of land are planted it is a permanent change of land use which requires no labour input bar a week or two every few years. With no work involved, communities die. The farming community is fighting the closure of veterinary laboratories in Sligo, Kilkenny, Limerick and other areas. This is in the context of the Government talking about maintaining rural services. None of it makes sense, and that is why we are here today. Rural Ireland cannot be neglected until it turns into a theme park to be visited by tourists who can marvel at the greatness of old Ireland. Rural Ireland is not an area that can be covered by forestry in order to provide some kind of green lung for western Europe. Rural Ireland is a potentially rich and healthy environment in which to live and raise children and make a living. That is what we need to see happen. Our agrifood sector is still the backbone of the economy, even with the lack of support which should by now have made it a foundation on which to build a vibrant and thriving rural economy. Rural Ireland is not just about farmers. The social fabric of Ireland is still tightly woven around agriculture and its auxiliary activities. People who live in rural areas, even if they are not engaged in farming, like to live near where farming is taking place around them. It is part of what we are in a real and present sense. This is the lifestyle that most of us know or are just one generation removed from.  That is not to say we are romanticising the hard graft and hardship that goes along with life in farming, the land or working with livestock. Country people are far from romantic when dealing with the realities of their lives. They and I know, as does the Government, that without the necessary infrastructure, technology, investment and transport given the decline in its population poverty will increase all over rural Ireland. The Government is not supporting rural Ireland. Instead, it is eroding the infrastructure, services and commerce which existed in the past. It goes against every tenet of progressive and environmental policy in a world running out of fossil fuels to cut back on public transport. That is happening everywhere. Such a policy forces everyone who needs mobility to work or study to own a car.  The closure of post offices, small rural schools, Garda stations and libraries and the withdrawal of public services and transport are the death knell for some areas. These are the kind of measures that the Rural Equality Bill will ensure could not happen without proper scrutiny of the effects and the justification of its implications in all rural areas. We want to ensure any policy that comes from any Department is rural-proofed to ensure rural Ireland does not suffer as a result. It is not about adding extra costs. Rather, it is simply ensuring that there is scrutiny.

We all want a better deal for rural Ireland and to ensure rural issues are to the forefront of policy-making. The Government is making a concerted effort to make this a reality through more co-ordinated policy-making for rural Ireland and the establishment of a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for rural affairs. The Government is supporting rural Ireland and I want to outline a number of things that have happened recently. I launched the €20 million town and village renewal scheme. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, launched the CLÁR and rural recreation programmes. Those schemes will provide a vital support to rural communities right across the country. In February, I announced the successful applications under the arts and culture capital scheme, which was the largest investment in our regional arts facilities in a decade with over 85% of the funding going to protect projects outside of Dublin. We are investing in rural Ireland right across Government. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, increase the budget for local and regional roads by 9% this year. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has provided an additional 500 places on the rural social scheme. I met the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Canney, today. He is investing €430 million in flood relief measures right across the country between now and 2021. The Minister for Justice and Equality has introduced a new grant scheme to help communities to provide CCTV systems, which will help to combat rural crime. We have an ambitious target to create 135,000 jobs outside of Dublin between now and 2020. The unemployment figures released yesterday show that the unemployment rate now stands at 6.2%, down from a peak of over 15.2%, which is very encouraging. Those jobs are being created in all regions. There is a lot to be positive about when it comes to rural Ireland. We need to move away from the constant narrative that rural Ireland is dying on its feet because that does a disservice to all of those people who are proud to live in our rural communities. Rural Ireland is resilient and fighting back. Deputy Kenny mentioned broadband. The recent announcement from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, on the agreement with Eir means that 300,000 more premises, most of which are located in rural Ireland, will have access to high speed quality broadband within the next 90 weeks. A lot of things are happening in rural Ireland. Rural-proofing of Government policy is a key commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government and the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development. I have no doubt about the good intentions behind the Bill, but the fact is that it is flawed in many respects. The Bill provides for the preparation of rural impact schemes by public bodies. These schemes would set out the arrangements to be put in place by public bodies for assessing and consulting on the likely socioeconomic impact of measures introduced by them in rural Ireland. The Bill also provides for the monitoring of such impacts, the publication of results in regard to this monitoring process, the training of staff and ensuring public access to information and services provided by the public body. The Bill, in essence, wants public policy makers to ensure that issues affecting rural Ireland are considered in full before any policy or initiative is agreed nationally and locally. For a number of reasons I believe this will, in fact, create the opposite effect and will, by the nature of the various provisions set out in the Bill, impose such a burden on public bodies that it will in effect lead to public bodies engaging in a box-ticking exercise. Rural Ireland would be seen as an encumbrance, an administrative shackle and something to mitigate against, not as the vibrant economic force it has the potential to be. The scope envisaged by the Bill is so wide that it envisages that assessment will be carried out in respect of any enactment, executive or other decision, determination or policy of a public body and it would seem it is intended to apply to all public bodies regardless of their function. This is simply not practical. It would, in effect, bring policy-making and decision-making at all levels to a halt. The Bill specifically states that enactments in a money Bill would also be covered by its provisions, thereby applying it to enactments such as a finance Bill. This could have serious implications for the timely passing of legislation to give effect to the annual budget. It would also be unreasonable to apply a rural impact assessment to legislation or policy which has no bearing on rural communities such as legislation governing purely technical matters. It would be a waste of time and resources. The Bill, as drafted, can be interpreted as requiring all public bodies to prepare a rural impact scheme. However, there are likely to be a significant number of public bodies for which such a scheme is not relevant or material because of the nature of their work or geographical remit. Why would we seek to impose this on bodies and agencies when we will not see any real benefits for rural Ireland? I referred to the administrative burden that this Bill would impose on policy-makers at national and local level. I accept the need for better rural-proofing of policies across national and local government systems, but putting in place a statutory requirement to rural-proof every measure of every single body, as foreseen in the Bill, is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It will impose a set of obligations on policy-makers across the public service which will have little or no meaning to many. We have to accept the likelihood that every policy and enactment would claim to be rural friendly, without us necessarily seeing a genuine advancement in or engagement with rural progress. Those policies that genuinely need to be considered more closely in the context of rural impacts will be lost in a sea of meaningless administration. I also have concerns about the Bill from a legal perspective in that it suffers from a number of technical and administrative flaws. For example, it envisages the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the responsible Minister. While we all acknowledge the vital importance of the agriculture sector to the rural economy, rural Ireland does not stop at the farm gate. Indeed, that is a point that was reiterated to me on a number of occasions during our consultations on the Action Plan for Rural Development. What we all want is for rural Ireland to be treated fairly in decision making locally and nationally but what we need is genuine and meaningful engagement on rural issues with policy makers at both national and local level. We need to work collaboratively with people to get the best results. We do not want to be in the position of dictating a one-size-fits-all approach. We do not need an overly complicated and burdensome set of legislative proposals which will have us all tied up in administrative knots for the foreseeable future with no real or tangible benefit for rural Ireland. We need a flexible, common-sense approach. I accept fully that the current arrangements for rural-proofing of public policies and legislation could be improved. The Government's Action Plan for Rural Development, "Realising our Rural Potential", which I launched earlier this year, takes a whole-of-Government approach to both the economic and social development of rural communities across Ireland. The Action Plan includes a firm commitment by my Department to develop a rural-proofing model by the end of this year. However, we need to look at all the options open to us. It is premature to go straight down the legislative route before examining all the ways and means by which we can bring about improvements to the current arrangements. The rural-proofing model will be developed through consultation with key experts in rural development. My officials have already begun examining the various examples of rural proofing that are currently operational in other jurisdictions and how we might best develop our own model. I am determined that whatever model we ultimately develop, rural-proofing should start at the earliest possible stage of policy development. It should also apply only to those bodies where such proofing is relevant and where it will lead to real impacts in rural communities. The model needs to be flexible, practical and, above all, effective. It should allow relevant bodies, agencies and Departments to engage in a meaningful way with policies and initiatives that impact on rural Ireland. I am proposing today that the Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs be part of this process. It would be very helpful if the committee could examine the issue and recommend whether rural-proofing would be best achieved by non-legislative actions, by more targeted legislative actions or by a mixture of both. A report on the matter could then be presented to the Dáil. In its submission to the consultation process on the Action Plan for Rural Development, the joint committee expressed concern that rural-proofing requirements could be at risk of becoming a box-ticking exercise. As such, I hope the joint committee will share my view that it is in all of our interests to take a more detailed look at the various options open to us to achieve the maximum benefit for rural communities. I am convinced that this Bill would not have the desired effect of ensuring rural Ireland remains at the forefront of policy-making but would rather have the opposite effect. This legislation would lead to rural Ireland being seen as a problem to be overcome and a box to tick, which is something none of us wants to see. As I have said many times before, we must focus on the positives in rural Ireland. We must change the narrative and develop the potential of our rural communities to contribute to our economy and recognise them as part of our identity.

That said, it is a very positive starting point from which to focus on where the inequalities lie and, thereafter, how they can be addressed. I welcome the Rural Equality Bill, which proposes to look at the impact of all legislation which comes before the House in respect of the social and economic status of people in rural areas. As we know, there are currently huge inequalities between those living in rural and urban areas. The Bill seeks to address them. The Rural Equality Bill attempts to ensure that the laws we pass in this Parliament give people in rural areas equal access to everything. First and foremost, a robust roads budget must be put in place to ensure there is a proper road network, including an annual repairs and maintenance programme. Effective mobile phone coverage throughout all rural areas is a matter that must be addressed. Nationally, high-speed broadband must be rolled out as a matter of priority if we are to bridge the blatant inequalities that exist between urban and rural Ireland. It would provide a level playing field for businesses which might be contemplating a move to rural Ireland. The Bill will rural-proof major Government policies and strategies by taking into account how rural communities are impacted upon by Government decisions and, where appropriate, ensuring that adjustments are made. The awareness that policy adjustments must be made for urban and rural areas to coexist and thrive will, hopefully, address the differences in rural and urban services and the need to make provision for both. We must be aware that it is vital for rural communities to retain their small schools, shops, Garda stations, post offices, banks, community hospitals, rural transport and other vital services. I envisage that the Bill will look at ways to secure the future of these services and ensure the sustainability of rural communities. It is essential to give our fishing industry a high level of support as an important source of economic activity in remote coastal regions. Farmers are the backbone of rural communities and every measure should be taken to protect their futures, in particular those of farming families in disadvantaged areas on our islands and peninsulas. The lack of public transport in rural Ireland is an issue the Bill must address as a matter of urgency. Adequate public transport is particularly important for older people to ensure access to services and facilities and their engagement in social activities. Proper transport links would provide economic and social benefits. A large percentage of our rural population does not live in towns or villages. People are dispersed in townlands, which means they have to travel long distances to the nearest hospitals. This is particularly evident in west Cork where Bantry General Hospital, the only remote rural hospital in Ireland, serves a population of 82,000 people, many of whom live on the three remote peninsulas and islands along the Cork coastline. In July 2013, as part of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in Cork and Kerry, the casualty department of Bantry General Hospital was closed between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. As a result, casualty patients have to travel long journeys of sometimes up to three hours by ambulance to Cork University Hospital, CUH. We are all aware of the overcrowding problem which continues to get worse in CUH. I propose that the Rural Equality Bill will encourage the Department of Health to review the reconfiguration plan and, perhaps, make suitable adjustments which mean the reopening of the casualty department at Bantry General Hospital. The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report of April 2014 recommends a series of actions by Government Departments to support the long-term sustainable development of rural Ireland. Along with the Action Plan for Rural Development, the report could form the blueprint for realising the potential of resources of our rural communities.

I compliment Deputy Martin Kenny on the work and research he has done in order to put down the legislation. I welcome the Minister to the House. Deputy Michael Collins will be aware that in the long negotiations concluded this time 12 months ago, the Rural Independent Group insisted on a Minister for rural affairs. I do not want in any way to condescend to or disparage the Minister. She certainly understands rural Ireland but her portfolio was linked with arts, heritage, regional and Gaeltacht affairs. Rural affairs deserve a full Department of their own and would have it if we were serious about this. We thought the Taoiseach and Fine Gael were serious about it in the negotiations but it is obvious they were not. They merely stuck it on like a hind tit. I apologise for the expression but that is what it is. It is the poor relation.

I am not saying a word to the Minister. She has the task and she is doing her best. I am saying that rural affairs deserved a full ministry. In rejecting Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill, the Minister is the one who introduced topics to the discussion, including with regard to public bodies engaging in box-ticking exercises. She also stated that rural Ireland does not stop at the farm gate. We all know that. We do not need lecture on that. Perhaps some of the Deputies who have never left the Pale might not know it. The farm gates are vital. Look at the pressure on agriculture. Look at the inspection rates. We have a huge issue with a lack of gardaí throughout the country. We have one garda for every 370 people. We have one agriculture inspector for every 39 people. Think of this: last night, people here said farmers are not regulated enough and that there are not enough farm visits. They are riddled with farm visits - they are terrorised. The Government also promised us that it would desist from unannounced inspections and at least give people some bit of notice that the inspectors are coming, particularly as 99.9% of farmers want to be compliant and want to protect the environment, heritage and everything else. There is a small minority and they must be rooted out. Nobody supports them. I can list all of the issues, including rural roads, broadband, post offices, small schools and community hospitals, which I raised during a Topical Issue debate 30 minutes ago with Deputy Butler from Waterford about to step-down facilities in Dungarvan, County Waterford and Cashel. The beds were pulled without notice. The Minister for Health was annoyed that we were not notified. Nobody told us last Friday evening - the beginning of a bank holiday weekend - and they were moved on Monday morning. The number of beds and services are being cut but the Government tells us it wants to improve services. Mobile phone coverage has become a pure disaster during the past 12 months. It has got worse and worse. With regard to public transport, when there were strikes in Dublin huge energy was put into fixing them, and rightly so. When Bus Éireann workers went on strike, what happened? They were left out. What happened at the depot in Clonmel, one of the biggest inland towns in the country? In the middle of the strike, the buses were removed from Clonmel and now we have no public bus services provided by Bus Éireann. There are only private contractors. Is this what the Government means by rural services and rural support? It would not happen in Dublin or anywhere else. At midnight on a Saturday night, the depot was closed down, buses were stood down and drivers were either moved to a depot at 20 miles away or further or else they were retired. The to-hell-or-to-Connacht approach still applies in many of these quangos, such as Bus Éireann, CIE and the HSE, over which Ministers have no control. They are playing havoc with rural Ireland. We have a huge problem with IDA Ireland and I have it from the chief executive himself that it cannot get industries to locate outside Dublin, not even to the other cities. When I speak about rural-proofing, I mean everything below Newlands Cross on the other side of the M50. IDA Ireland cannot get companies to go to Limerick, Cork or even Galway, which is a difficulty. I am not blaming anyone for this but it is bad planning. They want everything in Dublin, which is congested and where people are falling over taxis and buses and falling onto Luas lines. I walked from here last night at midnight, and three or four taxi drivers were calling me into their taxis and dozens of them were lined up. One would be waiting two hours for a taxi where I live and one which not get one. That is a fact. All of this lip-service is no good. The Bill is a decent effort towards starting to do some rural-proofing and I do not think the Government will oppose it. The Minister said there is too much box-ticking and too many flaws in the Bill but it can undergo to legislative scrutiny. The Government can work with Sinn Féin and all of us who want to work on the Bill if it is serious about rural Ireland. I honestly believe that it is not. The lights are being turned out on a gradual basis. We have bad planning in the whole area of the regional strategies and the spatial strategy. We have companies such as EirGrid and what happened today with the Bord na Móna factory in Littleton, County Tipperary. It has been there for 60 years with a workforce of 87 people and 57 people out on the bog. The lights were turned off again. The staff were told they can go into arbitration tomorrow and they can go to speak to their unions, which can represent them, and they might be able to get alternative employment. To hell or to Connacht is back with the Government. It is always the way with Fine Gael. This is its policy. I am not surprised by it. The party does not care about the ordinary people of Ireland. That is so sad. We had the spectacle of the Taoiseach going to Glenamaddy - with its four country roads - or was it Edgeworthstown in County Longford? He announced whatever way he would go this week - with roads this way, that way and the other way. Two miles out from Edgeworthstown, one would drive into a pothole and lose the car. There is no broadband and no services for anything else. It is lip-service. Over the past 11 years we have roll-out after roll-out from successive Governments - I was in one Administration myself. I am sick of roll-outs. It is like the churn rolling in Tipperary Town, which is a festival that takes place in July. It is a wonderful festival. We are rolling out broadband and we are giving countless millions to consultants and big companies, who are milking the system and there is no service. I know a young man who lives two miles from a particular town. He applied to join the Army approximately three years ago but was unsuccessful. He got a second chance approximately one year ago. He has very poor broadband at his house in Faugheen, County Tipperary, and he decided to go to Carrick-on-Suir to an Internet cafe to be sure to be sure for an interview online. Halfway through the interview - bang - he was disqualified and it was not his fault. People try to fill out CEO forms. Farmers try to apply online to the Department and it punishes them for not doing so. They do not have the broadband to allow them to apply online. People who want to study are not treated equally. They travel to colleges in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Clonmel but they are totally disadvantaged compared to people in towns with broadband because they cannot do it. We speak about equality. We have some equality. We have second-class citizens and no better. Post offices are under savage attack. What did the Fine Gael Minister of State do? I told him here three weeks before Holy Week he had done the greatest Pontius Pilate job that was ever done. He said he had nothing more to do with it and that it was the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Naughten. This is the greatest charade that ever happened. He is from Mayo and claims to be looking after the people of rural Ireland. He just dumped it on the Minister, Deputy Naughten. It was the greatest weakest meanest act. The Pontius Pilate job happened on Holy Thursday. This was two weeks before that. He wanted a very early Easter. I hope he got his Easter eggs. He will get them if he does not retire because the people are sick and tired of it in Mayo and everywhere else. The Government is paying lip service. I am surprised at the Minister because she is from the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan which is a very rural part of the country. It had huge industry, with very ordinary people who had cottage industries with poultry and mushrooms and everything else, but they are all gone.

She has been removed with her State car and she does not understand what is going on. Rural people will work for themselves. They are not looking for handouts, they are looking for fair play and equity. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, tells me €130 million has been applied for under the sports capital grants programme. I assure the Minister that more than half of this is from country clubs and ordinary people who do their day's work and go out and get involved in voluntary work in communities. The country would stop, particularly rural Ireland and the cities, if volunteers withdrew. What do we have here? The Government is blackguarding them day and night with more regulations from the EU and statutory instruments. I was here with the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, last night and he accused me of raising my voice. I was furious. He brought a Bill to the House relating to people who were prosecuted by public officials when the latter did not have the legal right to do so. That was wrong and the law was defunct.

One cannot make a wrong right, and one cannot make rural Ireland right unless the Government gets serious about it and tears out the officials and gets them down and dirty, and down behind the shopkeepers and to the post offices so they understand how hard it is to keep the doors open. I am not saying rural Ireland wants anything special. It wants fair treatment. If the people only have fair treatment they will do the rest themselves. They will not depend on the Government and the Dublin brigade for the sops. They will do it themselves.

As a rural Deputy, rural Ireland is obviously very important to me. Before I get onto the specifics of the Bill itself, it seems to be a habit of successive Ministers, when in government, to look at situations and try to gloss over the reality.I will stand up for rural Ireland every day of the week. We talk about broadband. There is broadband in rural Ireland. It is possible to set up a small business in rural Ireland, but the service is sporadic and not comprehensive enough. The current plan is to have a comprehensive service by 2023. That simply is not soon enough. We have to be realistic. If we want to put rural Ireland on a par with the east coast, we have to do so in a manner that is comprehensive and quick. These are very simple issues. Look at local GAA clubs across every county. They cannot field under-age teams. They have to combine with other clubs to put forward under-12, under-14 and under-16 teams. That is the reality. That is not something we are making up. We have seen four action plans for rural Ireland in the last two years. We do not need plans any more; we need action. We need those plans to be acted on and delivered. Deputies have spoken about roads. From 1999 to 2007, there was substantial investment into local, rural and tertiary roads. Now in 2017, that investment is literally falling apart. The investment in roads in 2008 was 50% higher than what it is in 2017. Let us not fool ourselves. Unless we put the investment and money in, then all the plans in the world are not going to work. We had local development agencies delivering Leader programme funding successfully, providing huge supports to all sorts of communities and agencies across rural Ireland. Mr. Phil Hogan, in his wisdom, decided to end that particular service and to bring the local development agencies into the local community development committees, LCDC, and into the local councils, which he thought was a great concept. That happened in 2014. It is now 2017, and in my county - I do not know if every other county is the same - not one cent of Leader funding has been spent since then. Something that was working efficiently and providing a great service was stopped and replaced but the reality is that nothing has happened. I would love to stand up here and say the LCDC was working. I would love to be able to say some of millions of euro was spent in my county because of the advent of this organisation, but the reality is that it has not been, and we have to stop fooling ourselves. We need action and spending but we do not need any more plans. The Wild Atlantic Way was a fantastic concept and hugely successful. How much money has been invested on the way itself, specifically on the roads on the Wild Atlantic Way? Again, if my county is anything to go by, not a cent. All those issues need to be addressed and, in my opinion, what we are doing is producing reports which are great in content but very light on action. On the Bill before us today, Fianna Fáil obviously appreciates the concept of rural-proofing, and it is essential to consider it in the development of rural areas. Unfortunately, the Bill contains many weaknesses that need to be looked at. The weaknesses I refer to are that the Bill proposes that rural impact assessments be applied to legislative proposals, which would include money Bills. If this was to be transposed into law, it could impede the passing of the finance and social welfare Bills each year. It would also not be practical to carry out rural impact assessments on all policy proposals, including where proposals have no direct impact on rural communities. The Bill would obligate all public bodies in the State to prepare a rural impact assessment. It would seem to be a retrograde step for public bodies which do work that does not impinge on what is desired in the Bill, or with a certain geographical remit - for example, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority - to have to carry out such an assessment. Hollowing out rural areas the length and breadth of Ireland would not help. We would be carrying out unnecessary work which would not serve rural Ireland. We will support the amendment put forward by the Government. However, I ask that the issues this Bill raises with regard to support for rural Ireland be addressed properly. Forget about glossy reports and glossy announcements and put in real investment.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-04 00:00:00	Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]	338	I am glad to speak on this important Bill this evening. There has been a growing divide between urban and rural regions which has been ignored by successive Governments or, at best, we have not had effective measures to deal with it. We have regulatory impact assessments and social impact assessments and other legislation already in place. This Bill proposes a similar process and would have the same effect, potentially protecting rural communities. Mention has been made of the fact the Bill may not be perfect. We have Committee and Report Stages where Bills can be changed and amendments can be put. I ask that the Bill go forward, and I know Deputy Martin Kenny will speak more on this as the man who put it forward and I want to compliment him on that. The Bill will put a statutory obligation on public bodies to adopt an impact assessment aimed at reducing inequalities for rural Ireland, which will show a clear commitment to the future of our rural communities. People are being forced out of communities. People may be living in rural Ireland, but are being forced out of it to find work and to suffer long daily commutes. We meet them every day on our way to Leinster House. This is because of the lack of employment, services and basic infrastructure. We need to put in proper infrastructure in the regions, whether it is mobile phone coverage, broadband coverage or rural post offices. This is every bit as important as the rural electrification scheme was in the last century. The threats to rural Ireland are very real, and there are many examples of how they have been disregarded in various Government policies going back over the last number of decades, which seem to ignore the uncertain future of many rural communities. Coming on the back of the closure of many rural banks, we now have the threat of the closure of rural post offices. The potential closures will have a serious impact on community life. Following years of neglect, the Government now needs to look at the impact that this will have. It must develop other options to create a viable post office network by expanding the services. Our party has called for the inclusion of services such as those outlined in the Kerr report, including motor tax, business rates, banking services, collection of rents and various other Government services. We have been proposing that for a number of years. The former Deputy, Michael Colreavy, outlined this a number of years ago. Post offices should also retain existing services such as social welfare payments. The Government's commitment in the action plan for rural development is to ensure that all homes and businesses are connected to broadband, which is good. We want that. The lack of high-speed broadband in rural Ireland is a serious limitation. It is key to helping to breathe life into sustainable rural economies and rural Ireland. There is a huge question mark over 540,000 homes and premises across Ireland that do not have proper coverage. There are a further 200,000 on top of that which will have proper coverage under the scheme announced a month ago. In fact, that is picking the low-hanging fruit. The company involved has had a go at me over it but I stand over what I said. If one picks the richest pickings first, anybody coming in after that will find it more difficult to service the hard to reach homes and premises. Previous commitments from Government on broadband access have failed in many areas and have failed many communities. They have left many communities behind, with no or very poor coverage. The Government needs to have a clear vision for the way ahead for rural Ireland and it needs to take action. We have an opportunity with renewable energy.We have not caught onto this properly at all. There have been some pilot projects but we need to go up a gear on this. There is an opportunity here to create jobs and income in rural Ireland through renewable energy. This would help sustain rural populations. We have options for the expansion of biomass, anaerobic digestion, solar, hydro and various other forms of renewable energy. It would help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and we all know how far behind we are in that regard. It will help both to create a greener economy and to create economic growth within areas where jobs are needed most.  My constituency, comprising Laois and south Kildare, faces a number of problems including threatened post office closures and loss of other services. However, the population has increased by 5% there and there is no case for closing post offices. As we seek sustainable growth in the area, we need diversification of the services offered by the post office and with the increase in population, the post offices can be made sustainable. Utilities are lacking across the board in rural Ireland and for example, some people in Errill, south Laois, do not even have mobile phone coverage. In the townland that I live in, Clonroosk, which is on the edge of Portlaoise, I do not have mobile phone coverage. I have changed provider twice in the hope that I get mobile phone coverage, but in the year 2017, I still lack such coverage in my own house. I am getting high-speed broadband, which is being put in where I live at the moment and that is to be welcomed. However, there are huge tracts of Laois that do not have phone coverage. I believe the mobile phone companies are taking down masts because they do not want to pay rates on them. People are telling us that mobile phone coverage is getting worse. I find that in areas where there was coverage, it is now weakened. On broadband, the latest commitment to roll out broadband to 200,000 homes and premises includes only 5,060 in County Laois. That still leaves 12,845 harder-to-reach premises and homes that will not be serviced and the company that goes in there will have rich pickings. In Kildare, for example, under the scheme recently announced, there will be 8,956 premises serviced. That discounts 13,434 harder-to-reach premises. I highlight that as a typical example of what is going on across the country.  Figures were released in response to a Sinn Féin Member's parliamentary question on IDA jobs showing a net gain of IDA-backed jobs in County Laois in 2015 and 2016 of 28. That is out of a total net gain of just over 39,000 in the State over that period. While there has been a net gain of 39,000 jobs in IDA-backed companies in the Twenty-six Counties, which and my party welcomes, only 28 of them were created in Laois. Somebody needs to catch someone in the IDA and give them a shake. The county councillors of all parties are complaining about it and Deputies are being asked what is happening with the IDA. Rural communities can struggle to have access to vital services and they are struggling to survive. We need firm legislative action to give protection to rural Ireland and that is what this Bill does. I will flag the importance of local government, which is sometimes left out. Local government need to be brought in as central players in this regard. I travelled around rural areas last weekend in my own constituency, as I do most weekends. There are fairly good facilities in some villages, including good sporting facilities and GAA clubs, but there are problems with lack of players. There are good primary schools in the villages but they lack the critical hub. We need to make sure we have post offices, good broadband services and shops. There is an area from Mountrath in County Laois to Kinnitty in County Offaly, where Deputy Nolan lives, in which one cannot buy a sliced pan or a bottle of milk as there is no shop. It is a huge area, a 25-mile strip, where one cannot even buy tea bags. We need to make sure that we have critical hubs.  The population is going to increase in this State. Let us try to build hubs and try to ensure that some of that population increase happens in rural villages. That can be done with good planning in a sustainable way and should be connected to sewerage and water schemes.

This State is rudderless and has been without a spatial plan since 2002. Due to the policies of the Government, the population and economic activity are over-concentrated in an overheating Dublin area. In international comparisons, Dublin's size is far out of kilter. At present, the greater Dublin area accounts for 39% of the population of the State, soon will contain 50% of the population and we are in significant danger of becoming a city state. The decline in rural Ireland is being accelerated under the Minister's watch. Basic services are being downgraded by the Government. According to An Post, approximately 500 post offices are unsustainable. Representatives of Teagasc appeared before the committee I chair a couple of weeks ago and said that 63% of the farmers in this State are economically unsustainable.Per capita growth in the west is quarter of what it is in Dublin and unemployment along the Border is three times higher than it is in Dublin. In some parts of the State, broadband speeds are 36 times slower than in Dublin. The north-west quarter of the country has neither a rail line nor a motorway. The cities of Cork and Limerick are connected with a single-carriageway road. The IDA has for the past ten years pumped approximately 60% of its investment into the Dublin and Cork regions. This is not to mention that the Government has closed 139 Garda stations. It is closing bus routes and has prevented credit unions, which desire to invest their massive amount of capital they have, from so doing in housing and business projects.  This debate is not about being anti-Dublin. It makes no sense to overheat Dublin. Rising house prices, spiralling rents and gridlock on the motorways all make it more difficult to live and survive in Dublin. It is nuts that we are actually talking about taking water from the Parteen basin and bringing it all the way to Dublin because of a lack of water supply there. What about the idea of bringing jobs, housing and people to the Parteen basin instead of spending that level of money on infrastructure? That money would not have to be spent if we had a little bit of balance in our investment here.  This is being driven by emigration and a lack of regional transport and communications infrastructure. The Minister mentioned a heap of different programmes the Government is developing but all the programmes in the world are not worth a damn if a person cannot do business in regional and rural Ireland. The Government can provide all the supports it wants but if people cannot transport their product or staff or cannot communicate with anybody outside of their area, if they cannot get the resources in to create their products and if they are hampered at every turn with regards infrastructure, they simply will not be able to locate in rural areas. That is the most important issue.Another issue, to which Teagasc pointed, is interesting on a demographic basis. More and more young educated people in this State need two incomes to survive and to pay their massive mortgages and massive rents. The only place they can find those two incomes is in large urban areas. They move to those areas, taking the energy of the generation out of the areas and relocating it in urban areas. This also creates a big age gap between the west and east, militating against development in the country. This Government has a really skewed investment programme across the State. Agriculture, the backbone in rural areas, is on its knees. Some 37% of farmers are economically sustainable, a phenomenally low figure. This is at the same time as there is a massive hunger for energy but the Government cannot seem to join the dots on this issue. The Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, has failed to provide any feed-in tariffs to allow farmers to produce small-scale biomass, small-scale solar or wind generation to make sure they can make a profit from the energy that is in their farms. Bord na Móna is importing millions of euro of biomass every year from Madagascar and Mozambique to this country, but we will not provide the supply chains for farmers here to be able to do the same. In the past ten days Paddy McGuinness resigned as the chairperson of the Western Development Commission, an organisation that covers the Minister's county. He is a former Fine Gael councillor but was extremely forthright and brave in detailing the reasons for his resignation citing the lack of Government commitment to the west as one of the reasons. He stated:I believe strongly that there is absolutely no commitment at either political or administrative level to balanced regional development nor is there any worthwhile plan to address rural decline. My experience over the last four years has convinced me that the WDC's potential to initiate and deliver progress within the region is neither understood nor supported. For example, the only contacts with me from my parent Department were on matters relating to governance... never an engagement on what the organisation was doing or how it could achieve more.He said the current programme for Government continued a line of committing to an enhanced role for the Western Development Commission but that, in spite of persistent inquiries at political and administrative levels, the board had not been told exactly what an enhanced role meant or involved. This Government has existed for well over a year and it has not yet told the WDC exactly what it is looking for it to do in the future. Mr. McGuinness's statement cannot have been easy, especially given that he is a friend of the Taoiseach and was appointed by the Taoiseach in 2012. Níl sa phlean gníomhaíochta d'fhorbairt tuaithe a fhoilsíodh ag tús na bliana ach bileog de shean-bheartaithe, gan breis airgid ann le dul i ngleic leis an scoilt idir uirbeach agus tuaithe. In ainneoin moltaí leanúnacha ó shaineolaithe go ndéanfadh an Rialtas plean fhorbairt tuaithe fadtéarmach a sholáthar, ní maireann an plean is déanaí ach le haghaidh trí bliana. Níl aon modhanna ann le fíor-mheastúchán a dhéanamh ar an dul chun cinn sa phlean. Is é oidhreacht Fhine Gael maidir leis an gceantar tuaithe ná rian millteanach a fhágáil ina dhiaidh mar thoradh ar an neamh-aird agus na polasaithe déine a cuireadh i bhfeidhm. Another really important statistic to come out during the week was that 87% of physical exports in this State are from the FDI sector, with only 13% from the indigenous sector. This is shocking as it leaves the country massively exposed to a possible FDI shock. Most of the indigenous exports are better geographically distributed than the FDI exports and are based in the regional and rural areas of which we have been talking. Meat exports make up a significant chunk of these. Indigenous business is still the poor relation of the economic policy of this Government. In most countries FDI is known as a transitional policy and most countries try to build FDI so that they can move towards a good, strong, healthy indigenous sector but not this country. FDI is the final resting place of this Government's policy and, as a result, areas which would benefit far more from indigenous development are being left out. The only thing that matches the lack of political will of this Government is the lack of capital investment. In the last budget it suggested a €300 million increase in capital investment but this is a paltry figure. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was told that €3 billion was needed to get secondary roads up to a safe level but the total increase last year was €300 million. Sinn Féin produced a budget with a €1.2 billion increase in capital investment, all within the unfair EU fiscal rules. I implore the Minister in front of me, who has his heart in the right place but who appears to be on his own in Cabinet, which is deaf to the needs of the people of rural Ireland, to support Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill.

First, I commend my party colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, for bringing forward this Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that public bodies submit policy measures, legislation and regulations for rural proofing. It requires that regard be had by public bodies to the desirability of reducing socio-economic and other inequalities suffered by those in rural Ireland. It provides for the carrying out of rural impact assessments for measures that are likely to have a significant impact on local communities. It is a short, simple Bill designed to deal with the unequal treatment of people in rural areas and to protect rural communities. This measure has been introduced in the North and an enhanced rural proofing process was put on a statutory footing under the leadership of the then Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O’Neill. Rural Ireland and rural communities are the heartbeat of this country. This Government pays a lot of lip service to rural Ireland but the truth is that the lack of investment in rural communities is having a real impact on the lives of many rural communities. People living in rural communities are being treated as second-class citizens. I have always lived in rural Ireland and have witnessed the decimation of rural communities day by day. Outside of the large urban centres, there are no green shoots of economic recovery. Rural communities have witnessed the closure of vital services such as post offices, Garda stations and even banks. In my constituency of Offaly-North Tipperary two banks, in Ferbane and Edenderry, have closed in recent times while in north Tipperary, Garda stations in Lorrha and Terryglass have closed despite local opposition and people pleading for them to be left open. Rural communities have looked on helplessly as young people have been left with no option but to travel to cities or even other countries to find work or to avail of educational opportunities. Rural communities have to wait longer for access to health services due to the lack of investment in ambulances. They have to put up with a lack of effective public transport and huge swathes of rural communities have no access to broadband. In this day and age this is totally unacceptable. Many farmers depend on broadband to file returns and other forms and there is no excuse for not providing access to it. It means that businesses, schools and other bodies located in rural Ireland are at a distinct disadvantage. Under the Fine Gael-Labour Government, local communities were disempowered. Infrastructure has deteriorated as a result of severe cuts to regional and local budgets affecting roads, housing delivery and, most noticeably in recent times, flood protection. I have met with IDA representatives on two occasions in Edenderry, a town in north Offaly with the highest rate of vacant commercial buildings in the country. I wanted to encourage them to secure investment in our towns where it is needed.I was informed they were not looking at Edenderry or many other towns in Offaly because our roads are too poor. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I might as well not have bothered because he lives in a very wealthy urban constituency and is completely out of touch with rural communities. Based on the answer I got back, I would have expected more from a Minister. I again implore him to look at the budget and ensure rural communities are given enough money for the upkeep of roads. The poor roads are resulting in us losing out on jobs and the potential of investment to grow the economy. We are being set back as a result. Towns and villages across the State have become depopulated and many are like ghost towns. Our farming and fishing communities have come under attack and many farmers on poorer quality land struggle to make ends meet. There high level of farm inspections in Tipperary is also an issue of concern for many farmers who are already under tremendous stress living from day to day trying to make an income to support their families. That also needs to be looked at; we have to be fair. More than 40% of people live in urban areas while more than one third of the population of this State live in or near Dublin. This imbalance is unsustainable. Sinn Féin wants to make rural Ireland a sustainable place to live and work, where the quality of life is matched by the quality of public services. It should be a place where young educated graduates have the opportunity to stay and build their future, and a place that welcomes back emigrants, including those forced to leave over recent years. The Bill, if implemented, will provide our rural communities with a fighting chance of survival. It will ensure that the rights of local communities are respected at all levels of policy making. There is a disconnect and lack of respect for rural communities. We will not continue to be treated as second-class citizens. I say that as a rural Deputy. I hope that all Deputies will support this important legislation.

The Minister, Deputy Humphreys said in her speech, "What we all want is for rural Ireland to be treated fairly in decision making locally and nationally but what we need is genuine and meaningful engagement on rural issues with [relevant] policy makers at both national and local level". I will start my 16th year as a Deputy at the end of this month. During that period I was a rapporteur for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I completed a report on the west of Ireland, Awakening the West - Overcoming Social and Economic Inequality. In preparing that report I travelled from Malin Head in Donegal right down to west County Cork. I met fishermen, farmers and their organisations. I met people from family resource centres and small and medium-sized businesses. I met representatives of every sector it was possible to meet and produced this report. That report was accepted and supported unanimously by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It has sat in an office gathering dust since 2004. Deputy Pearse Doherty, Teachta Dála for Donegal, also completed a report on small and medium-sized businesses, which is sitting out there somewhere. I believe that dates back to 2007. The former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan - after pressure from people from rural areas, particularly Pat Spillane who believes passionately in rural Ireland - produced the CEDRA report. That is also sitting out there somewhere gathering dust. I cannot understand how a Minister can stand up here and say, "What we all want is for rural Ireland to be treated fairly in decision making locally and nationally". The four successive governments that have been in power since I was first elected have all said the same thing. I was part of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture which did a report on our offshore oilfields. That report is also sitting out there even though supported unanimously by the committee. While Ministers might say that is what they want to see, what the hell are they doing about it? The reality is that nothing has changed and it has got worse. There is a decline in the numbers of young people in rural Ireland. I come from a coastal county. Right across the west and south of the county was the home of Kerry football. Every club south and east of Dingle has amalgamated with one or two other clubs for under-age football. Valentia Island is a fantastic area and one that has increased its population through returning elderly people. However, with young people it is struggling to put out a football team. One might ask why. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was in the area recently to discuss a ferry which is a lifeline for tourism for the island. The ferry company has been told to replace its vessel at a cost of €3 million. From its own pocket it is putting up €1 million. The Minister, Deputy Ross, has told me that €2 million is a huge amount of money and he does not think he would be able to get it. It would only cost €2 million to keep a community alive and vibrant. I spent part of my life as a fisherman, from the mid-1960s, through part of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. I saw it gradually declining because there was no political support for our coastal communities. I do not need to tell the Minister of State that; he knows it, as he comes from a coastal county. Some 87% of the mackerel quota is in the hands of 23 vessels. I know from the Minister of State's body language that he feels that is a terrible injustice even though he might not be able to say so in here. It is an absolute political disgrace. Who runs the country? Do the elected Government run the country or does the permanent government run the country? That is one of those disgraces. There is an increase in the mackerel quota. Will it be distributed equitably among those involved in the inshore fisheries? If the Government had a bit of fairness or equality, it would have vibrant coastal communities. However, because it has no political will to drive that equality agenda, the coastal communities are absolutely decimated. The same can be said for the farming community. The small family farm has practically been eroded of the face of our country. In large part that is down to cartels that are able to set the prices based on their agenda. Everybody in this House knows what I am talking about but nothing has been done about it. There is a cartel where a huge beef baron can tell farmers what they are going to get because he has access to the national data. Again nothing can be done about it even though we all know it is happening. Until there is the political will to challenge those who institutionalise inequality in our society, it will continue as it is. We have the erosion of post offices in rural communities and the closure of a large number of Garda stations with more due to go. There is also the transport aspect. Elderly people living in peripheral rural areas depend on the small post offices and the postman to get the messages to their house. If that goes, those people are left totally and absolutely on their own and without any support. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, said "I accept the need for better rural-proofing of policies across national and local government systems". Every Minister I have ever come across has said the same thing, but none of them have done anything about it. Deputy Brassil is a friend of mine and yet he has said that Fianna Fáil cannot support the Bill.I know well he cannot support it, because while in government his party did absolutely nothing. With his party practically in coalition in this Government, it is not going to implement something that is going to try to help deliver equality for the people who live in rural Ireland. The Minister of State is from rural Ireland and he knows what I am talking about. He will probably respond by reading the script prepared by the people in the Civil Service and say things that undermine what we are saying. I do not mind him trying to undermine that or trying to challenge the Bill we have put before the House. However, I ask him for God's sake not to pay lip service by saying that he is going to do something about it, because my experience and knowledge of what is happening in this House is that rural Ireland is just some place out there that is thrown something now and then and that is all. Deputy Martin Kenny comes from rural Ireland and is as passionate as I am and as many others are in this House. We have to stand together. I do not give a God damn what political party Members are in. If we do not stand for the communities we represent, we should not be in here.

I find it highly ironic that I am probably the only Dub in the House. I do not know about the guys working here, but I certainly feel like asking whether there any Dubs in the House at all. It is always made to look like there is an urban-rural divide behind this. However, most of the rural Deputies are from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and it is extraordinarily ironic that they come into the House time after time making a commitment to rural Ireland, yet at every hand's turn they are destroying its very existence with their policies. I argue that there is not some deep fissure between people born in the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country. Indeed, most of the people in the Dublin area have country cousins. There is not an antagonism towards rural Ireland. It is rather an issue of politics and class. I will go through the statistics later on. Just as there are very isolated parts of rural Ireland in which people suffer deep poverty, unemployment and tick all of the boxes, that can also be seen in areas like Neilstown, Jobstown and in parts of my constituency such as Ballyfermot. The question of class is very fundamental to this. The way in which resources are used is very fundamental. Most important, it is political policies that are driving the destruction and the isolation of rural Ireland. They are the policies of modern-day neoliberalism that says that everything has to happen to turn over a buck and make a profit, despite the occupancy of the areas, the quality of life and the people who live within them. I completely agree with Deputy Ferris and could not repeat as eloquently as he did the tragedy of what has happened to rural fishing communities. It is tragic. I often think when I see the Wild Atlantic Way advertised - I know the west very well as I love it - that it is advertising something the State has pulled apart and destroyed. There used to be dozens of little piers around Mayo, Galway, Donegal and Kerry that one could drive along, visit, camp beside, hang out in or rent a house nearby. The life has been torn out of them. One will hardly ever see a crab cage or a bunch of nets there because the life has been torn out of those rural communities. As a consequence, the people have left. I will look at three specific issues that I have been involved in since I was elected to the House. The first is Bus Éireann. Rural transport is being treated, again, like a commodity. If it does not turn over a profit and does not do so fast enough to compete on the open market with the private operators, what is the Government's answer? It is to drive down the wages and conditions of the workers in the company and to take away many of the rural transport routes. Something like 200 towns and cities, mainly towns, have been left without Bus Éireann services. At the end of this month, the bus line that services Dublin to Derry is going to be closed. I know that it is going to be passed on to the Translink company in Northern Ireland, but at the same time, we are going to bypass many towns that bus route serves. We have seen the strike and been through the arguments about this. The National Transport Authority is a quango set up by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that allows the Minister, Deputy Ross, to sit through months of the transport strike, and probably to do so again in the future, while it tries to bully workers into accepting deals with the threat that this company will fold if they do not accept them. It allows Deputy Ross to say it has nothing to do with him, that it is the National Transport Authority that issues the licences and that it is a dispute between the National Transport Authority and the unions. That neoliberal hands-off approach to a very fundamental service in rural Ireland has led to much of its isolation. The second remarkable thing I would like to talk about is the closure of the post offices and the demise of what those post offices meant to rural Ireland and to villages. I have certainly never lived long enough in rural Ireland, but anecdotally I can tell the Minister of State of how I have seen first-hand the post office act as a social headquarters for local villages and communities. The postmaster or postmistress was almost like a social worker knowing exactly who or what needed help and when and how it needed it. If someone did not show up, he or she would send someone out to look after them because God knows what was wrong with them. All of that has been torn out. What I found remarkable over recent months both in the committee and in the Dáil is that between the three different Ministers, none of them would take responsibility for it. To my knowledge, they are still not taking responsibility for it. They are all getting paid a nice fat wage and will retire on nice fat pensions, but they are not taking responsibility for the demise of one of the crucial services that look after rural Ireland. The last thing I want to talk about in terms of infrastructure is broadband. We have privatised the provision of broadband and we are still making a bags of it. The Government's idea is to take it away, let companies compete with each other, see which can give us the best price and see where it goes from there. In the 1950s, we were able to turn on the lights in the Black Valley and in every little isolated community in Ireland. We did not ask how long it would take to tender it or what company would be able to deliver it quicker, faster or neater. We set up a State company called the Electricity Supply Board and that did the business. It brought the power to the Black Valley, to Glencolumbkille and wherever else. We are going to make a bags of it by putting it in private hands, just as we are making a bags of the question of social housing provision. As long as we prioritise the right of profit over the right of communities, individuals and our population to decent services, we will face the continued decline, isolation and utter destruction of our rural communities. As a Dub, I find that obnoxious. I will stand up for those communities, be they the post office workers, the bus workers or any of those fishing communities, at any stage at which they stand up and fight this State for adopting a neoliberal approach to their lives rather than one that actually fulfils their needs.

I was involved in the negotiations for a partnership Government. On page 42 of the Programme for a Partnership Government document, it states:As part of our smarter regulation agenda, the new Government will step up the use of impact assessments across Government, driven by a new specialised section within the Cabinet Secretariat. The new impact assessment guidelines will have to take account of impacts on rural Ireland as well as other socio-economic factors.That is actually in the programme for Government. The commitment to carry out impact assessments is already there. It seems to me that this Bill will take that aspiration of the Programme for a Partnership Government a step further and enshrine it in legislation. At European Commission level, impact assessments are conducted for all major policy proposals to guide decision-makers and improve the quality of legislation. The office of the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development in Europe sees impact assessment models as a support to the development of policy with the aim of making the best possible evidence available to those who are responsible for making choices and taking decisions. This is not new. It is enshrined in our programme for Government and also in Europe. I would take issue with just confining it to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I believe carrying out impact studies should be a cross-departmental responsibility. It could involve the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It needs to be broadened out in that regard. The Bill will put an onus on public bodies to focus on rural-proofing and carry out not just environmental assessment statements for planning but also rural impact assessment statements, which will make us aware of the positive and negative factors associated with any particular policy and how it will affect rural society.This is not just an economy, it is also a society. We have to respect that. We need to rural-proof many of our decisions. I was involved in a campaign which started out as very narrow; it was no doctor, no village. We soon realised, however, as we organised town hall meetings around the county, that it was not just about rural GP services. People felt disenfranchised because rural Ireland was being neglected. We had people protesting about the closure of post offices and Garda stations, schools decline, the loss of shops and pubs. Our campaign picked up on the unravelling of the fabric of rural society, which is to be regretted, but there is an inequality in the unravelling. We pay the same taxes but, unfortunately, we get a very unfair return and deficient services. Many speakers have spoken about the lack of infrastructure in rural Ireland, including broadband, mobile phone services, connectivity and rural transport services. It boils down to the fact that if there are no businesses in rural Ireland, there will be no people. There are knock-on effects of so many Government decisions, many of which are unintended consequences. In having an impact study the unintended consequences could be identified early and rectified.  I will concentrate on rural transport services, including Rural Link. There are 17 companies throughout Ireland which need to be funded in a flexible manner. Transport Infrastructure Ireland intends to bring uniformity to all Rural Link transport systems, many of which have to adapt to the geography and the people they serve. There is a need for flexibility in the way they are run and funded.  Employment is key to the sustainability of rural Ireland. We must encourage local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to get companies to set up in rural Ireland. As Deputy Peadar Tóibín mentioned, this has become a nation of city states. We are overheating the major cities, Dublin in particular, as can be seen in the price of housing, the lack of housing, the congestion and the social problems caused by all of these factors. We should be promoting the positivity associated with rural Ireland, the landscape, our culture and the quality of life in rural Ireland. We should be selling these to international companies which are finding that they cannot provide housing or infrastructure for their employees. It is about equality nationwide. One can go to many countries in Europe and not be aware of an inequality between town and country because they have rural-proofed their decisions and provided infrastructure to give equal opportunities. Ireland lacks that concept. We do not have a culture of supporting isolated and rural communities. We have to adapt our policies to take this into account. There is a vicious circle of decline in rural areas which we have to transform into a viable circle of growth. If we can encourage people to live and work in rural Ireland and provide the infrastructure needed, we can do that. We must implement the recommendations made in the CEDRA report, a wonderful report produced in 2014. Many of its recommendations have not been implemented, but Clare County Council has taken the lead and set up a rural development section. Perhaps other councils are doing the same, but as far as I know, it was the first council to do so. It has set up a rural development forum which has been meeting in the past few months. In June it will develop a rural development strategy for County Clare which we hope will act as a template for other county councils and which will look at strengths and weaknesses and develop rural development structures within the county. We will be looking for some funding from the Government to fund the provision of rural development officers who could concentrate on specific areas in the county which need viable rural development. I have mentioned that Dublin is overheating. We can see it in every aspect of society. When Members leave Leinster House this evening, it will probably take them an hour to get as far as the M50. We have to look at rural Ireland in a completely different way. Rural-proofing of decisions is extremely important in the case of health services. We have centralised services in the past ten years under the heading of "reconfiguration". Reconfiguration made some sense when concentrating expertise in regional hospitals, but we have stripped county hospitals of viable services. There has been a failure to devolve services to such hospitals which could provide a huge number of services close to where people live and prevent them from having to travel constantly to centralised regional services. There are deficiencies in mental health services and also in the ambulance service. At times in County Clare one can wait two or three hours for an ambulance because of the lack of ambulance staff. As I said, we are in danger of becoming a country of city states. We need balanced regional development. It is no longer an optional extra but absolutely essential.

Rural-proofing of decisions would ensure rural Ireland was not sidelined or overlooked but would get its just desserts. It is an important principle. All we are seeking is fair play, to which we are entitled. This cause is one to which I have not just come in recent times but is one which has underpinned the Labour Party philosophy which I developed and articulated in the early 1990s. It is party policy.  The Government has a number of issues with the Bill. They are relevant and cannot be discounted, but they could be addressed by Deputy Gino Kenny, the proposer of the Bill, in a spirit of co-operation. I compliment him on bringing it forward. The Labour Party broadly supports its objectives, while acknowledging that there are issues that could be sorted out. As a party, we are unequivocal and extremely passionate about ensuring economic growth reaches every part of Ireland in order that families will be able to continue to live, work and raise children in rural areas and play an important role in their communities. We need a real and effective charter for rural Ireland that identifies clearly key issues so as to better support rural areas. There must be more active participation in rural development initiatives developed by communities, not by bureaucrats in imposing their own solutions which are generalised, idealistic and theoretical. It must be done using a bottom-up approach to support economic and community development and with stronger action to keep family farms and rural entrepreneurs viable.  We must also address structural issues such as the age and gender profile of the agriculture sector. While it is not the only active industry in rural Ireland, it is the backbone of the rural economy. We must ensure better co-ordination between local enterprise offices and local authorities to support local enterprise projects and minimise the red tape which is strangling initiatives. In the recent general election the Labour Party proposed initiatives to deal with some of these issues, but they were drowned out in the maelstrom of electoral razzmatazz. We have had our fill of glossy reports. What we want are real, effective and substantial resources. We do not want to receive a pittance which is tantamount to, metaphorically, doffing the State's hat at long-standing issues which will cause the death of rural communities. There has been a fall-off in population. We see the future of rural schools being threatened, football teams disappearing and churches, Garda stations and post offices closing, all because, as Deputy Martin Ferris said, the population is dropping. We need a town revival programme, safer rural communities and lower cost services for rural families, not just farmers. We also need more incentives to support young and small farmers to encourage them to enter the artisan food and organic farming sector. There should be targeted action to regenerate derelict sites and increase funding for rural businesses and projects. We must build thriving hubs of economic activity across every region. It should not stop at Lucan, Newlands Cross or outside the Pale.  I recall the establishment of CEDRA and the rural development economic zones which saw some investment in the rural economy. Despite the multiplicity of recommendations emanating from CEDRA under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat Spillane who was very dedicated and committed, only a paltry amount of a few million euro was allocated to drive them forward. It was a missed opportunity because the initiatives were an attempt at rebalancing investment in a targeted way. I am aware of the launch on 8 January by the Ministers, Deputies Heather Humphreys and Denis Naughten, and the Taoiseach of Realising our Rural Potential: Action Plan for Rural Development.Some of us who live in rural heartlands, like myself, are echoing the cries of the late John Healy who continually outlined in his brilliant book, No One Shouted Stop, how thriving towns and villages were decimated and became, in effect, lasting monuments to our failures and to what was essentially the turning of a blind eye to the myriad of problems by the State. In effect, such towns and villages fell foul of non-integrated Government activity, policies and actions.  We need a more joined-up approach in Government policy on agriculture so that we maximise the potential links between food production and tourism. Smaller scale producers need to be supported to go after niche markets through innovative use of protected food designations. I am very strongly supportive of rural economic development zones, REDZ, to better support businesses and producers in small towns and villages. This needs a fund of at least €20 million to €25 million to give it real impetus going forward. It is time that a targeted social enterprise scheme was established which could be funded from the local property tax to facilitate the reopening of key high street facilities such as pubs, shops and post offices which formerly formed the heart of rural communities. Local authorities need to continue to support town renewal plans so as to allow towns to devise their own local development plans and improve local infrastructure and amenities. These plans would assist in preserving and restoring local heritage sites and developing a vision for the future of rural and urban areas.  The Government's rural action plan lists 270 actions to be carried out by various agencies across Government, as well as utilising existing plans. It refers to the revitalisation of 600 towns and villages, improved access to broadband and the arts, improved tourism activity trails and so forth. However, the hole in the bucket is the level of resources allocated. A total of €60 million across roughly 32 counties amounts to €2 million per county, which is totally insufficient. We need hundreds of millions of euro to re-balance the country.  The CAP accounts for 37% of the EU budget but there is ongoing pressure from some member states to reduce that proportion and to direct EU spending to new issues such as migration. There is also huge competition for funding for other more traditional policies. The UK's departure from the EU will reduce the overall budget by between 5% and 10%. This will put significant pressure on the availability of funding for the future CAP. While the CAP budget for Pillars I and II is funded until 2020, there will be a big hole in the budget thereafter which could have significant consequences for rural communities and farmers in particular. It represents a real and substantial threat.  The provision of high speed broadband and the digitalisation of rural areas can transform those areas. The Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen is an outstanding example of how such a transformation can be effective. It was Ireland's first rural digital hub, providing users with 1000 megabytes of super fast broadband. It provides state of the art co-working spaces and makes room for professionals in Skibbereen in west Cork. Since opening in April 2016, it has been a beacon of success. The World Bank has suggested that a slight increase in broadband speeds can raise local GDP by up to 10%. Once super fast broadband reaches an area, success follows. Clearly, connectivity is the key. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. The Ludgate Hub serves as a beacon of innovation for rural Ireland and this can be replicated across the country if there is a will. Talk is cheap, but bringing together the whole community and installing the necessary infrastructure can bring results. Let us resurrect rural villages and bring people back to rural Ireland.  The local needs criteria in the planning code, as part of county development plans, are about to be eliminated and die and that will help. In villages of between 300 and 400 people no rates or charges should be levied on local shops or businesses. They are all struggling to survive and compete against the likes of Aldi and Lidl in the large county towns, many of which were granted permission to locate on the edge of those towns and in out of town centres, which was another bad planning decision. If we do not recognise the importance of rural shops as cornerstones of rural sustainability, they will disappear off the landscape. In the next four to five years many of these shops will go to the wall, helped to their end by State and bureaucratic statutorily imposed charges and levies and neglect. Let us wake up and smell the coffee while the embers are still alive. Shops and post offices have the potential for shared community services and to act as multi-purpose spaces for the community.  We cannot hang our hat on the same old tried and failed formulas. In Ballymore Eustace, which is part of the Ceann Comhairle's constituency, the local postmaster, Mr. Sean Fogarty has established a pioneering hub, offering online consultations with doctors and other services from his post office. That typifies the entrepreneurship that is required to save our post office network. All this baloney, talk and theory is nonsense. We need flexible and innovative thinking which is not blinkered or institutionalised, qualities which have bedevilled Irish bureaucratic views for decades.  Last year 22 newsagents disappeared in rural Ireland. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents has called for the creation of a dedicated ombudsman for micro retailers who are being crushed by the big boys and driven out of town. Let us do like John Healy, let us shout "Stop". Instead of throwing €20 million or €30 million as window dressing, let us pour hundreds of millions into rural Ireland. Everyone of us in rural areas pays tax but we are disadvantaged. We do not have Luas or buses passing by our gates. Very often we are thumbing a lift, confined to a bike or forced to walk. No-one knows that better than the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne.  I spoke about the potential of the fishing industry last night. I do not want to go off on a tangent, but that is one area on which the Minister has a good grasp. I wholeheartedly support this Bill, as a rural person who has seen at first hand the devastation that has been wrought in rural Ireland.

It is the job of a Government and a State which claims to be a republic, to treat all its people equally, with an equal right to housing, health care, education and other essential services which we depend on to live and prosper. The running down of Bus Éireann is salient in this regard. Bus Éireann is in the Government's cross hairs because its entire purpose is to serve as many people across the island as possible. Bus Éireann is vital to the continuation of rural communities but is in direct opposition to the Government's desire not to invest in anything that will not make a quick buck.  Courtmacsherry, which is not in my constituency but in my county, once had a railway station, a dance hall, cinema, petrol station and 17 shops. The last shop closed last year but local residents formed a small co-op. This is what is happening in rural Ireland. In my own constituency of Cork East, I recently met members of a rural community group. They explained that while we now have the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East to promote rural and coastal areas, tourists cannot get down the roads in their area. There are lights at the start of the village, nothing in the middle and lights at the end. Once one gets past that, the beaches are closed. There has been much talk about investing in rural Ireland, particularly in tourism. We must invest in our rural areas, treat them properly and engage with the people who live there. We need to improve our roads, footpaths, lights and broadband but above all, we must treat our rural citizens properly. We have a property tax but the people of rural Ireland are getting nothing for it. This is about equality because we all pay tax. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill.

Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an ábhar seo - cothrom na Féinne do mhuintir na tuaithe. Bhí mé ar turas i nGaeltacht na Rinne i gContae Phort Lairge inné. Bhí áthas orm an obair atá á déanamh ag Údarás na Gaeltachta sa cheantar tuaithe Gaeltachta seo a fheiceáil. Is iontach an rud é go bhfuil daoine fostaithe sa cheantar. Agus é sin ráite, bíonn dúshláin ann i gcónaí. I acknowledge the population shifts that have taken place in this country over a long number of years. Deputy Tóibín alluded to the fact that over 50% of the population of our country now lives in the province of Leinster. Even within counties, we have seen a shift from rural areas to the cities or large towns. This has happened over a long number of years and I acknowledge and accept that this is the situation. That is why we accept the sentiments of Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill and hope that its principles will be debated by an Oireachtas Committee which can explore the issues further. A number of Deputies made reference to the programme for Government and the preceding establishment talks. The Government did establish a Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Obviously every Department touches in some way on rural Ireland. It is impossible to bring everything into one Department. We cannot have a Department that looks after rural health and another that looks after city health because it is all interconnected. Likewise, we cannot have a Department for rural transport and another for urban transport. That simply would not work. There has to be cross-departmental collaboration on issues concerning rural Ireland. There is an interdepartmental committee and that is why the action plan for rural Ireland was published. All Departments have key targets and responsibilities to deliver on and there is an implementation group that is working to that plan.The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has outlined the reasons she cannot support the Bill. That is not to say we do not support the principle of improving life in rural Ireland and providing equality for people in rural Ireland. We want a plan that actually works. We would welcome the input of an Oireachtas committee in this regard. No previous Government has put in place such a co-ordinated and comprehensive plan of action to support rural development. A number of Deputies - probably everybody who spoke - touched on the issue of broadband. I share the level of frustration that has been felt for many years by politicians, business people and rural dwellers as a consequence of the many false dawns there have been. I can understand the suspicions that persist, even with the latest commitment contract with Eir. I know that houses are already being connected. Houses in my own parish of Moycullen are being physically connected to fibre. There have been similar developments in the Cois Fharraige area of Connemara. People can see that it is coming. Some 300,000 houses that were not connected last year will be connected over the next 90 weeks. I appreciate there is more to do. I understand why people who are living in close proximity to areas that are connected ask why the service cannot be extended further down the road. People want to know why their neighbours can get these services but they cannot. Such services will be delivered over the next period of time. A number of Deputies mentioned post offices. I am not going to pretend that this is not a challenge. It will continue to be a challenge. I remind Deputy Mattie McGrath that 288 post offices closed between 2005 and 2010 when the Government he supported was in power. There have been fewer closures since 2011 than there were during that period. That is not to say that challenges do not exist. I know that the Kerr and McKinsey reports are being examined. I hope we can ensure the existing post office network is saved. I accept that there are issues with rural mobile phone coverage. There is a task force. An implementation group chaired by Ministers is seeking to ensure we improve rural broadband. I am aware that planning permission for a mast in my own area was not renewed because people objected to the mast. Funnily enough, some people were talking on their phones outside the local authority while they were objecting to the mast. Their objections have resulted in poor quality coverage in the area in question but that is beside the point. I accept that there are concerns about rural mobile phone coverage. The implementation group is looking at solutions in that regard. Deputy Tóibín spoke about the spatial strategy, which has not worked. We are pursuing the Ireland 2040 strategy in its place. The projected growth under the spatial strategy did not materialise. That is why we have asked for inputs under Ireland 2040. The Deputy also spoke about unemployment, which has decreased from 15% to 6% since 2011. I could speak at length about the challenges we have faced since that time, but my time is almost up. The Government is committed to improving services in rural Ireland, despite all the challenges that exist, to ensure it gets a fair share of resources. I hope the sentiments of the Bill can be explored by an Oireachtas committee, which can then report back to the Dáil.

The general consensus among everyone is that rural Ireland has huge problems. Deputies from every political party and none, including those who are in government and those who support the Government from the Independent benches, recognise that rural Ireland has suffered from under-investment. That is acknowledged in the programme for Government. There is a sense that rural-proofing needs to happen and that a system needs to be developed to facilitate it. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, set out a range of reasons for the Government's position on this legislation. She said the Bill would require too much work and too much analysis. She referred to the difficulty caused by the fact that the scope of the Bill means that it covers many Departments. She mentioned the Dublin Port authority as an example of a State body that has nothing to do with rural Ireland. We understand that point. Nobody is saying that this will work everywhere, or that every Department will have to be rural-proofed. It would be quite absurd to make such a suggestion. Common sense will apply, naturally enough. The Dublin Port authority will have no problem crossing the bar when it comes to rural-proofing. This Bill seeks to ensure the budgets of Departments with nationwide responsibilities, such as the Departments of Education and Skills and Health, will be examined to ensure rural Ireland is getting the same level of provision, at least, as urban Ireland. We are not making that proposal with the aim of taking anything away from urban Ireland. As Deputy Bríd Smith said, many people who live in Dublin and other urban areas are encountering difficulties. I do not think the Government's reasons for not being able to support our rural-proofing proposal stand up. Its programme for Government suggests that this needs to be done. We are suggesting that rural-proofing should be legislated for to make sure it is guaranteed. We are giving the Government an opportunity to ensure that when it leaves office at some point in the future - it might be in a year or in ten years - people will not be able to point to this as another area in which it has failed. If it accepts this legislation and ensures it works, it will be able to point to this initiative as an example of its success in working with other parties. The various problems that have been highlighted can be teased out as this Bill advances through Committee and Report Stages. For example, it was suggested that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, rather than the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, should be dealing with this area. That may very well be true, but this is the first Government that has had a full Minister with responsibility for rural affairs. There has always been a senior Minister with responsibility for agriculture. That is the reason we have proposed that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be the key person in this regard. At least we know there will always be a Minister for agriculture. This aspect of the Bill can be broadened out to give a role to several Ministers, if that is what needs to be done. All these things can be done on Committee and Report Stages. Many Deputies spoke about the many problems in rural Ireland. It is important to mention that there are many magnificent things about rural Ireland as well. We need to harness the huge potential that exists in rural Ireland. When I travel around my constituency, I see Ben Bulben in its magnificence as it overlooks Sligo Bay and I see surfers going out to sea in Ballyshannon and Bundoran in County Donegal. When I am in County Leitrim, I see the waterfall in Glencar and I see people boating on the River Shannon in Carrick-on-Shannon. This level of potential exists in the tourism industry alone, but many people cannot access it because of this country's poor road infrastructure. Many people who would like to live in that area because of its beauty and its quality of life do not do so because of the lack of access to quality broadband. Many industries do not locate in that part of the world because of the lack of sufficient infrastructure to ensure they can prosper. I recently spoke to representatives of an English company who were thinking of moving some of their manufacturing to Ireland as a result of Brexit. One of the company's senior executives has a connection to County Leitrim and considered whether some manufacturing could be moved to that county. When the company's officials looked at the possibility, they realised that the travel time to Dublin Port was too long. They decided that if they are going to move some of their business to Ireland - I hope they will do so - they will locate somewhere nearer Dublin because of the travel times involved. It is mainly down to the road network. Rural Ireland needs certain things to happen if it is to fulfil its magnificent potential. The production economics for manufacturing businesses located in rural Ireland are better than anywhere else because houses are cheaper both to buy and to rent. Lower salaries can be paid because the cost of living is not as high as it is in urban areas. All those things are advantages that businesses can have if we can get them into rural Ireland. We have magnificent potential in many ways. Ireland and its rural communities have a positive story to tell. The biggest problem in our rural communities is that they do not have enough people in them. That is what this is about. If we can get more people into rural Ireland, we can change things around. The only way we can get more people to come to live and stay in rural Ireland is to make sure the necessary infrastructure exists in rural Ireland. I remember speaking a few years ago to a group of consultants led by Peter Quinn, who is a former president of the GAA. He drew up a report on the things that attract IDA Ireland businesses to come to certain areas. Among the key things mentioned in the report were access to quality education, access to quality health services and good infrastructure. One might not think the quality of a local school would matter in these circumstances, but it does. If a company is planning to send its executives to live in an area, it will want to be sure that those executives' family members can access quality education. Those things need to be put in place outside of Dublin. We see every day that Dublin is choking. We need to move out into rural Ireland and the regions. The only way to do that is to invest in the regions. There would be a return on such investment. If €100 million were spent on the road network in rural Ireland, it would have a return. It is probable that 40% of that expenditure would come back into the Exchequer within a year between VAT, excise duty, income tax and all the other things that happen. That is not counting the money that workers would spend in local shops and communities when they are building such roads. The Government needs to understand that these are not costs. In most cases, these are investments which will have a return greater than the cost initially laid out. Even in the medium and long term, they will have a significant benefit because they unlock potential. County Leitrim has the largest number of graduates per head of population. More people per head of population in County Leitrim go on to third level education than in any other county, yet there are practically no jobs for graduates there. That needs to change. If we could change that, we could revolutionise what rural Ireland is about. The Bill is about putting such a commitment into legislation. It is about changing it from something we just say is a great idea. We can say we have all these problems and we can all bitch away about them but there is nothing at the end of it. This Bill provides an opportunity to do something about this. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to withdraw its amendment and allow the Bill continue to Committee Stage. There we can work out the problems, the little details and the tweaking. We will co-operate and work together. If the Government does so, when it leaves office, whenever that will be, it can point to this as a success not just for rural Ireland but for urban Ireland as well. As was pointed out by many this evening, urban Ireland is choking. This is an opportunity to do something for the whole country, which is good, positive and will make a difference. I commend the Bill to the House. Hopefully, when it is voted on next Thursday, we will get it through.
