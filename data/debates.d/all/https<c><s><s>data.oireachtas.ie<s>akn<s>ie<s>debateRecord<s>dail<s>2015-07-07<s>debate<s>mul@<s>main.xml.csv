I would also like a comment on some reports in the press about an internal competition for vacancies at senior ranks within An Garda Síochána, with a case taken against the Public Appointments Service. Given the recent publication of the Central Statistics Office report and trends in that regard, will the Minister outline the projected Garda numbers for 2015, 2016 and 2017?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	3	The personnel strength of An Garda Síochána on 31 May was 12,772. The first intake since 2009, consisting of 100 recruits, entered training in Templemore on 15 September 2014. As part of the 2015 budget, I announced a further intake of 200 recruits, and on 15 December, the first 100 of those started. The remaining 100 entered the college in February this year. The September intake attested as members of the Garda Síochána on 23 April and, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, have been allocated by the Garda Commissioner to stations around the country, where they can get supervision and take up front-line duties. There will be further attestations in July and September, and I have received sanction for a further two intakes of 125 each. The number of new recruits coming on board is 550 in the past year. Taking account of crime trends and policing priorities, they will be assigned appropriately. It is not possible to say precisely what Garda strength will be at the end of 2015, or even more so in 2016 and 2017, as this will depend on the number of retirements. They can vary quite significantly from one year to the next. As I have said all along, the retirement rate will be very carefully monitored and will naturally influence the level of recruitment needed to maintain Garda strength. The Deputy also asked about internal vacancies at different levels. At senior management level there are very few vacancies, but as we move down levels there are some vacancies, and the Garda Commissioner has permission to recruit for them. I understand these will be filled through promotion competitions that are currently being arranged. I will circulate a document to the Deputy with the precise figures for vacancies at each level where there is an opportunity for promotion. The Deputy asked two further questions and I will return to them.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	4	The problem in the community, as I and others are being told, is that the Garda capacity to investigate and detect crime, as well as Garda response times, are under much pressure because of the downward trend in headcount. The Minister has indicated that there are 550 recruits in or about to be in training, which is welcome. Will the Minister indicate where we will go after those 550 have been trained? She has rightly pointed out there are 12,772 gardaí, but we must bear in mind that 1,498 gardaí are today eligible for retirement. I know and accept that not all of those will go in one fell swoop. We can add to this the 500 gardaí who are out sick, on average, any day of the week, while another 230 are on incentivised career break. What is the Minister's projection for recruitment for the latter part of this year and into next year? The Minister mentioned Garda stations. Many of the smaller stations that were not closed are supposed to be open, but they really only operate for an hour per day. Is the Minister aware of the case taken by a senior member of An Garda Síochána against the Public Appointments Service and the Attorney General, which I read about in the press? It relates to the interview process for the position of deputy commissioner.

In discussions with Templemore and the Garda Commissioner, it is very clear that this is the maximum Templemore can take per year. It has been higher in the past, but there have been issues about supervision when those recruits go out into the community and we want to do it to the highest professional standards, as does the Garda. I have said I want to see continuous recruitment to an Garda Síochána. The Garda Commissioner will keep an eye to the operational challenges. One must also consider the kind of reform that is under way when talking about effective policing. It is very clear that investment in ICT is essential and will impact on effective use of Garda resources. Much of crime now, in the case of burglaries, for example, involves highly mobile gangs. The investment we have just made in the right type of vehicle is an essential part of targeting crime. It is not about sitting behind a desk, it is about being out there and being mobile. I would like to deal with the question Deputy Collins asked, very briefly if I could, about the open competition-----

I am asking the Minister to comment on that, given that we have a new independent authority coming down the tracks. What input, if any, has Josephine Feehily, as the chairperson designate, had to that process?

An application for an interlocutory injunction in respect of that competition is currently being considered by the High Court. In those circumstances, the Deputy will understand that I cannot make any further comment on it. It is before the High Court. As regards the independent policing authority, I am awaiting a time to bring that legislation into the Dáil. Deputy Collins probably saw the position of chief executive advertised at the weekend. Clearly, once the independent policing authority is up and running, it would have a responsibility regarding recruitment, but not at this point.

It relates to charging, not major sporting organisations here in the capital and in our other major cities, but local festivals that struggle to raise the money every year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	20	Section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides a statutory basis for the Garda Commissioner, as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote, to charge for the policing of certain events such as sports fixtures, concerts and festivals. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost to the event-holder is determined by the number of Garda personnel deployed. The operational plan for a particular event is formulated by local Garda management. The objective in charging for police services is to recover the cost of providing the service and all such charges are agreed with event-holders in advance. I am sure that the House will agree that it is incumbent on all public bodies to ensure that they are run efficiently and cost-effectively. One of the means the Garda Commissioner has at her disposal to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the Garda Síochána is to charge for such services. I consider the Garda Commissioner and her management team to be best placed to determine the appropriate level of reimbursement to be sought in each case. As regards the level of recoupment sought, I am advised by the Garda authorities that they seek to recover all of the policing costs associated with commercial events organised with the objective of making a financial gain without a specific community or charitable benefit. In respect of events held with the objective of providing a service to the community and-or making a financial gain with surplus proceeds going to the local community, a contribution towards the policing costs is requested. Exceptions to these arrangements are made, however, in respect of events run solely for charity purposes or national events such as the main St. Patrick's Day parade, and charges are not levied in these cases. It is right that the Garda can charge for these services, but I support the lower level of charge for the kinds of events the Deputy is asking about, which benefit the community.I have no plans to amend section 30. It seems to me that the Garda is implementing it in a fair and structured way.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	21	The Minister talks about a reduced charge. I am aware of a festival in Donegal which struggles to raise funds every year. They got some funding from local government or arts bodies for their festival. They were charged €4,000 for policing by An Garda Síochána - €3,000 up front and €1,000 afterwards - which was more than the grant aid they had received from other government bodies. The gardaí in Donegal are very upset about this. They feel it is bad enough that their resources in the county have been cut back, the numbers of gardaí have come down and their relationship with local communities is struggling as a result, but then they have to charge the organisers €4,000 for policing of a festival that is invested back into the local community. That is merely one example and I could give the Minister many more. I believe the Minister needs to amend the section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. The intent was to charge for big stadia, such as Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium, but local not-for-profit festivals should not be contributing. The gardaí themselves do not want it. They are in an impossible situation. I am asking the Minister to amend the legislation.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	22	An Garda Síochána is currently looking at this policy area and developing a policy document formulating in more detail how the policing at certain events should be approached. As I stated, they have charges for these major commercial public events. Being commercial, clearly, these are for profit. On the question of community events, these will take Garda time and there is a considerable cost to many of them. It is incumbent on the organisers to reduce in so far as possible the level of policing that is needed at any particular event - obviously, we have to ensure public safety - and the presence of gardaí is nevertheless essential at some of these events. Deputy Mac Lochlainn has written to me in this regard. He has concerns about certain events. I do not think it needs an amendment to the legislation, but perhaps more refined criteria on these charges could be developed that would better reflect the ability of those organisations to respond. The Deputy might like to contribute to that policy development.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	23	That is encouraging. Sometimes, where there is clear legislation, the gardaí are given a clear framework. Gardaí, particularly in rural areas, pride themselves on the relationship they have with local communities, and it has been strong down the years. I did not realise the issue arose with local organisations but since I raised it, many other organisations have come forward and stated that they have endured this over recent years and they are very unhappy about it. In communities that have been struggling over recent years with the recession, both the gardaí and these community organisations do not want it. If truth be told, I do not think the Minister would want it either. I ask the Minister to engage with her departmental colleagues and the Garda Commissioner to see whether it would be better to give clear direction in the legislation through a simple amendment. That would give them a clear framework in which to engage. It would be a good gesture from the Garda for it to work in partnership at festival time. These festivals involve large numbers of volunteers. If one has all these volunteers and the Garda given a professional framework, that would be much better for everybody involved. I ask the Minister to amend the legislation.

There will be further refinements to the policy in that regard. If, at that point, there is still a concern, I will discuss the issue with the Garda Commissioner to see whether any change to the legislation is necessary. I do not believe any change is necessary at present, but it does suggest there is a need for greater clarity in this area given that a new policy document is being prepared by An Garda Síochána. That will help resolve matters. As a general principle, a graduated charge is a good idea in terms of responsibilities on those committees organising local events.Clearly, their income must be taken into account and the charge must be reasonable if the event is considered worthy of being held. Let us await the policy document and take the matter from there.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	25	What are the Minister's views on the report of the independent working group on direct provision, which is damning and contains limited recommendations on the provision of residency to those who have been more than five years in direct provision and on an increase in the weekly allowance? Does the Government intend to take on board these recommendations and make those changes?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	26	I welcome the publication of the report but do not agree with the Deputy's assessment of it. This is the first time that any Government has examined the direct provision system in 15 years. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and I set up the working group. All agencies working in this area were represented on it. It has made 173 recommendations. The report is broad and offers a roadmap for change in direct provision. Like other European countries, Ireland is responding to the number of asylum seekers looking for protection. People who present must be accommodated. Some countries detain them while others provide hostels of various types and still others provide no accommodation at all. Ireland has a system of direct provision, which has been assessed by the working group. Quite a number of recommendations can be implemented in the short term whereas others are medium-term or long-term recommendations. Some recommendations relate to persons who have been in the system for five years or longer and increasing the direct provision allowance. They are of a cross-cutting nature and require that I consult Cabinet colleagues. Many have significant resource implications and impact on other programmes, such as social housing. We must be cognisant of the changing environment in terms of asylum seekers. There has been a major increase in numbers. We have seen the situation in the Mediterranean. The numbers entering Ireland are set to double this year from 1,500 asylum seekers to 3,000. While that is starting at a lower base than we had previously, the Government must consider the matter in the round. My intention is to revert to the Government as soon as possible, having consulted with colleagues. We need a Cabinet discussion. The recommendations are cross-departmental in that they have implications for social welfare, housing and education. A number of my colleagues have commented on some of the recommendations and indicated a number of changes that they are prepared to make and on which they are working. An excessive length of time is the key problem. No other Minister has dealt with it, but we have the heads of a Bill that will introduce a single procedure. That is what will make the difference.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	27	I thank the Minister. Does she agree that the current situation is inhumane and intolerable, as described accurately by the Minister of State? I am sure that she has visited the centres where conditions are inhumane and intolerable. People have no individuality or freedom over what they do in their lives and are dependent on their centres to provide food that may not be of sufficient nutritional quality. It is an horrific way to live. Almost 8,000 people are in this situation, of whom nearly 2,000 are children. More than 3,000 people have been in this situation for longer than five years. The report's points include the uncertainty overshadowing people's lives, the lack of personal autonomy over the most basic aspects of their lives, the lack of privacy, the challenges of sharing space with strangers, the boredom and isolation and an inability to support themselves. After five years of living in this way, people's talents and skills, of which they have many, inevitably dim. They feel that they have been oppressed. Does the Minister agree that everyone should be gone after five years and that there should be an increase, which is still minimal as recommended, in the amount of money that they receive?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	28	The accommodation that is used across Europe for asylum seekers varies considerably. I accept that the accommodation varies in Ireland too. There are issues for children and families in relation to accommodation. The biggest problem is the length of time that children and families are spending in the system. That was the point my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, was making about the conditions. We are seeking to solve this problem by introducing new legislation to provide for a single procedure. This will mean that people's cases will be dealt with within a period of between six months and a year. The report says that when this more effective and efficient procedure has been introduced, other improvements can follow. Of course this procedure will also mean that economic migrants who are here illegally - people who are not asylum seekers but are assessed under that process - will have to return where possible to their country of origin. The EU stresses the issue of returns as well.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	29	It is correct to say that the standard of accommodation and the manner in which asylum seekers are treated varies across Europe. In parts of Europe, people are literally in prison camps. We have something that approximates in some respects to open prison camps. While our conditions are not as bad as those in some other parts of Europe, we should not compare ourselves to the very worst conditions in Europe. Almost 8,000 people in this country are living in conditions that give them no control over the lives on a day-to-day basis. They cannot buy things for their children. They often cannot afford extracurricular activities for their children in school. They cannot socialise, interact or be based in society. The manner in which people are being treated is inhumane. Does the Minister agree on a more fundamental level that we should not have a system that segregates people and takes them away from the rest of society? I suggest that people should be allowed to work, to contribute to society, to pay tax and to live as normal human beings with proper decency and full human rights.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	30	I have to say I do not accept the Deputy's characterisation of these facilities as open prisons. The children attend local primary and secondary schools, are entitled to medical services and are supported within the centres. I have some concerns. My primary concern and main effort right now is to make sure people are not in the system for lengthy periods. As the report recognises, many of these difficulties come about because people are in the system for so long. It can begin to feel very difficult for families in the system that have not had their cases heard. It is clear that the uncertainty is extremely difficult for people who have been in the system for lengthy periods of time. We have to deal with that. There are approximately 4,500 people in the system. At present, there is no accommodation for approximately 600 families that have been deemed to be asylum seekers. Clearly, the Government's broader investment in social housing will be part of the answer to the situation we are currently facing. I would say that this is a very big issue across Europe. Sweden is currently taking 80,000 people a year. Germany is taking 300,000 migrants. There is a need for a much broader programme of action at EU level, along the lines of that outlined in the EU action programme on migration, to begin to deal with this issue.

I would like to express my condolences to his wife Colette and his family. We should also bear in mind that the death of Ms Sheena Stewart is linked to this tragedy. I would like to pass on my condolences to her family too. I ask the Minister to outline the steps she has taken to ensure the independence and integrity of the investigation into the death of Sergeant Galvin at Ballyshannon Garda station. Could she also outline the timeframe for the completion of that investigation?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	32	The Deputy has referred to the tragic death of a serving Garda member in County Donegal on 28 May 2015. Before I deal with the substance of his question, I would like to join him in expressing my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and many colleagues of the late Garda member, who have been so traumatised by this tragic death. Like the Deputy, I think it is important that I should not exclude from the expression of sympathy the family and friends of the young woman who tragically lost her life in a road traffic incident on 1 January 2015. As Members know, the Garda member in question had been the subject of an investigation by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission into matters relating to Garda contact with a member of the public shortly before her death in the fatal road traffic incident. As a result of concerns raised following the death of the Garda member and following consultation with the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which I am bound to do under the legislation, I decided to use the power available to me under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to initiate an inquiry by an independent judicial figure into the conduct of the GSOC investigation. I used section 109 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 for the first time. I wrote to the Chief Justice requesting her to invite a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court to conduct the inquiry. The Chief Justice invited Mr. Justice Frank Clarke of the Supreme Court to conduct the inquiry and he has accepted the invitation. I welcome that. The inquiry will examine the conduct of designated officers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in respect of its investigation into the contact which members of the Garda Síochána had with a person on 1 January 2015 prior to her death in a tragic road traffic incident. Section 109 allows the judge to conduct the inquiry in the manner he thinks proper and he has full judicial powers in doing so, including the power, if necessary, to enforce the attendance of witnesses or to compel the production of records. Obviously, I have had no involvement with that inquiry. It is completely independent. The Supreme Court judge operates under the guidelines and will conduct the inquiry as he sees fit. I am anxious to give him the time required to carry out the inquiry but, given the circumstances, I expect that the result of the inquiry should be available to me in the short to medium term.

It is appropriate following the call from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, for such an inquiry. A GSOC spokesman stated at the time that it often engaged in peer review, whereby it got sister organisations from outside the jurisdiction to peer review some of its case work. Is that still happening in respect of this case and others? If so, will the Minister outline how many peer reviews have happened and what was their outcome? Also, GSOC says that Sergeant Galvin was cleared as part of its investigation, yet the file had to go to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for the DPP to make the ultimate decision in that regard. However, that was not communicated to Sergeant Galvin and the tragedy occurred. Has the Minister asked GSOC, or has GSOC said, if any new protocols have been put in place to prevent something like this from happening again?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	34	The Deputy's first question was about peer review. Once this tragic death occurred and the case came under scrutiny, GSOC immediately initiated a peer review and had taken the first steps in that. That was the right thing to do. The peer review system regarding Garda complaints is well established, whereby somebody from outside GSOC staff and from another system is brought in to conduct an analysis. That was an excellent first step in terms of GSOC's response to the situation. I met with GSOC, as I am obliged to do under the legislation. My decision at that point was that this was not enough and that section 109 should be used, so the peer review does not continue as a result. Peer review has been used by GSOC at different times, but I do not have the number of times with me. The Deputy's second question was about protocols and referring cases. GSOC has a practice of referring cases where a death has occurred to the DPP before it refers back to the people who have been under investigation. Obviously there were particular circumstances in this case.GSOC made that fact public as a result of the tragic circumstances. That has been its approach, however, because while it may believe no further action is needed, it is still required to forward the case file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for its view.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	35	People understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions makes the final call in this type of case. Should the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission not establish a protocol providing that, in cases in which it submits a file to the DPP making a recommendation that there is no case to answer, as occurred in the case of Sergeant Galvin, its decision will be immediately communicated to the person who was under investigation? This would at least give the person comfort in the knowledge that the investigating body was satisfied with the outcome of the investigation. At the same time, it is acknowledged that it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to make the formal decision on the case. Arising from the tragic case of Sergeant Galvin, has a three-way discussion taken place between the Minister, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and An Garda Síochána given the history of friction between GSOC and the Garda? While the relationship between these bodies had been improving, this case will have set back recent progress. In the interest of promoting confidence in the Garda and GSOC, the working relationship needs to be as good as possible.

Both sides have work to do regarding complaints, and they must work together. On the Deputy's question concerning the point at which persons under investigation should be informed of the outcome of the investigation, this is a complex issue. As it arises in the case we are discussing, I would prefer to leave any further comment on the matter to the inquiry being conducted by the Supreme Court judge. It may well be one of the issues addressed in the report of the inquiry, although I do not know one way or another whether that is the case. As it is a possibility, I will await the findings of the report. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission clearly took a particular approach to this issue. In cases involving a death, GSOC prefers to await the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions before giving the information to a person under investigation, given the possibility that the DPP will arrive at a different decision. 
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	37	I ask the Minister to report on discussions with her European colleagues on the circumstances facing migrants attempting to enter the European Union via the Mediterranean. I ask the question in the context of the thousands of deaths among those trying to enter the EU, as well as the report on the RTE programme "This Week" broadcast on Sunday last, which obtained a briefing document setting out the position to be taken by the Minister on this issue, which, if accurate, can only be described as callous and uncaring.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	38	I will deal first with the Deputy's second point. Ireland has never voiced opposition to search and rescue missions at European Union level, nor was I or any other Minister ever advised to do so. Internal briefing pointed to one of the unintended consequences of such operations, namely, the risk of more smuggling activity in even more dangerous and unseaworthy vessels. There was no question of Ireland or any Ministers being in any way at odds with our European colleagues on this matter. There were concerns about how best to deal with people smuggling and traffickers and the risk of taking any action that would encourage the smugglers to abuse more vulnerable people and place them in unseaworthy vessels. These concerns remain. Some 200,000 people will be placed in such vessels this year and will land at various ports or be rescued at sea. The European Union has six or seven naval ships in the Mediterranean, including the LE Eithne, which is carrying out search and rescue operations. On one occasion, the LE Eithne rescued 650 migrants from dangerous boats, which can only travel for about 20 km once they have been put to sea. Approximately 15% of the people rescued are women.One of those rescued just a few weeks ago by the naval ship was a four-week-old baby. These people are being exploited and, of course, the first thing we have to do is save them. As Deputy Paul Murphy said, the number of deaths rose to record levels in April, but have since dropped off very significantly in May and June as a consequence of the enhanced search and rescue activity by EU member states. We now have a bilateral arrangement with Italy which allows our naval vessel to go down into those waters. We are not party to the Schengen Agreement and there was no legal competence to go down to the Mediterranean at EU level until the recent agreement was made.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
LE Eithne has already rescued more than 3,000 migrants. The situation in the Mediterranean is a major priority at EU level. The consensus both from the emergency joint meeting of EU Foreign and Interior Affairs Ministers in April, attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and myself, and the special European Council, attended by the Taoiseach a few days later, was that the EU needed to take urgent action on a wide number of fronts. The European Council conclusions from 23 April laid down clear guidelines on what actions were necessary. These focused on strengthening Europe's presence at sea, fighting traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility. On 13 May 2015, the European Commission published the European agenda on migration, setting out a combination of immediate actions and longer term strategies. This was followed by more specific measures on resettlement and relocation; an action plan against migrant smuggling and guidelines on implementing the eurodac regulation. The two Commission proposals receiving most attention are those on the resettlement of 20,000 refugees and the relocation of 40,000 asylum seekers in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece to other member states, where their protection applications will be examined. These measures, in particular the latter, were the main focus of discussion at the recent Justice and Home Affairs Council, which I attended on 15-16 June. At that meeting, there were significant differences on the question of mandatory relocation quotas for member states and some also had difficulties with the share attributed to them. The European Council returned to this theme in June, as agreed, and while the discussions were lengthy and difficult, they were also constructive. The Council conclusions focus on three distinct pillars, relocation and resettlement, return and readmission, and co-operation with countries of origin and transit. It includes an agreement to help 60,000 vulnerable people, through a mixture of resettlement and relocation. Relocation will be exceptional and temporary and will be achieved on the basis of a voluntary distribution plan. This plan will be agreed by consensus between member states by the end of July. Ireland's position articulated most recently by the Taoiseach at the European Council and by me at the Justice and Home Affairs Council is one of support for solidarity which we were demonstrating in a number of ways. Ireland responded almost immediately by agreeing to take 300 refugees for resettlement in addition to the 220 we were already committed to taking. This puts us close to double the share we were being asked to take in the Commission proposal. Clearly, our substantial humanitarian aid and the work of the LE Eithne are further demonstrations of our solidarity. On the question of relocation, we have indicated that we are willing to give the issue careful consideration as an emergency once-off measure. Ireland is not bound by the proposal in view of the protocol to the treaties on our position regarding the area of freedom, justice and security. Ireland would have to opt in to the measure and this would require Oireachtas approval before we could take part. Realistically, given the timing and the need to see how the proposal evolves before making a decision, any exercise of Ireland's option in this respect would have to be made after the measure had been adopted at EU level. Ireland is also one of many member states to emphasise the importance of addressing the root causes of migration in an holistic and comprehensive way.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	39	The Minister accepts that the number of deaths has decreased since Operation Mare Nostrum was reinstated. It is a search and rescue operation as opposed to an operation emphasising border control, which characterised Operation Triton. Does the Minister therefore agree that the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum was likely responsible for the deaths of migrants attempting to enter the European Union? The reported advice to the Minister that the migrant crisis had little direct impact on Ireland and no intervention was anticipated at the meeting is quite incredible. Should the Irish Government not have intervened against the calls of others, including, reportedly, Britain, for the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum to say we should not have a fortress-Europe policy where this is treated as a defence issue, but should adopt instead a humanitarian approach to saving people's lives? What position did Ireland take in the discussions that took place around the question of the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum?

Responding in the best possible way was on everyone's mind. Clearly, there were humanitarian issues. No one wants to see even one person lost at sea in these circumstances. How does one deal effectively with people traffickers and smugglers who are ruthless and putting people into these boats? There is a concern still shared by some member states that having a response in the area is sending the message to the smugglers to put more people into those boats. Clearly, the European action programme on migration envisages more work with countries in Africa, more co-operation, more border controls, which is are very important, and a whole range of other actions that must be taken. Obviously, the humanitarian response of saving lives is critical. That is what is being done and Ireland is one of six countries which is involved in the search and rescue operation.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	41	Did the Irish Government intervene at the time of the debate around Operation Mare Nostrum to say search and rescue operations should be maintained? The smugglers are obviously dealers in death and should be condemned, but they are not the essential reason people are travelling. People are travelling because they are in conditions of extreme poverty, are desperate and are trying to enter the European Union to have a better life. I do not accept that search and rescue missions inadvertently assist criminal gangs and encourage less seaworthy vessels. People are going to travel to try to access Europe as long as their economies are destroyed and they are subject to wars, all of which the European Union more generally has a hand in. Does the Minister have a comment on the fact that the position paper outlined that Ireland should press for longer-term solutions such as requiring neighbouring states to include in trade agreements with the EU conditions on stopping migration to the Union? That is a repeat of the outsourcing of the militarisation of Europe's borders further beyond Europe as was done with Colonel Gadaffi whereby these people are paid money to keep migrants away. Is that really the answer? Should we not be trying to improve conditions in North Africa and the Middle East so that people do not feel the need to travel in such dangerous vessels?

Clearly, the breakdown of governance - the conflict situations - are the root causes of the problem. The Deputy is absolutely right that greater global work needs to be done to deal with those conflict situations and to ensure that there is governance in those countries in order that people are not as vulnerable as they clearly are at present. Ireland being outside the Schengen Agreement is in a different position. However, I certainly have been very strong in saying that we want to respond in a humanitarian manner. We immediately responded to the request for resettlement of Syrian and Eritrean refugees when we were asked to do so some months ago. We are taking slightly above the numbers requested. We have resettled approximately 2,000 people during the past ten years. That has happened where people have been assessed as refugees. We have also received a new request for the relocation of refugees which we now have to consider.

Has she an update on that and when will her Department make an official response to the new evidence that has been presented?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	44	I am very conscious of the deep impact the fire at the Stardust in 1981 has had on individuals and families concerned, and on the wider community. I met the Stardust Victims and Relatives Committee last year and that meeting provided me with an opportunity to hear at first hand the ongoing concerns of the committee in regard to this tragic event. The Deputy will be aware that these events were the subject of a tribunal of inquiry which reported in 1982 and an independent legal examination which reported in 2009. The report of the independent legal examination concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest. The then Government, as the Deputies present will be aware, accepted those findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing those conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families. Following my meeting with the committee and hearing the representatives' concerns, I appointed an official in my Department to liaise with the committee and who has engaged with representatives of the committee in the intervening period. A researcher associated with the committee, who is known to the Deputy, submitted material relating to these events to my Department and a meeting was held with the researcher and another person associated with the committee. The material previously submitted and the matters raised at that meeting have continued to be examined in my Department. I wish to advise the Deputy that some of the matters the committee raised, which it raised with me previously, are subject to a Garda investigation, and that is ongoing and quite complex at present. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that it is, as I have said, a complex investigation and I cannot do anything that might cut across that investigation, but there has been ongoing contact with my Department and a range of material has been submitted which has had further analysis. I will be back in contact with the committee in regard to that analysis.

Can she give a commitment that it will be examined in a timely manner? The Minister said she meet the victims' committee, which was very much appreciated, but that was more than a year ago. I know there was an issue about evidence being presented and then being taken back but that evidence is now with her Department. Can she make sure that the most qualified people examine that information and that a decision on it will be made in a timely manner?

We made every effort to have the evidence presented to us again so that we could examine it in good faith. We did that and that has happened. It is complex material. It is partly composed of, and makes reference to, among other things, a report of the tribunal of inquiry, transcripts of evidence to the tribunal of inquiry and the report of the independent legal examination.I assure the Deputy that we have been examining the material. A specific official has been assigned to examine it. A great deal of time and effort has been put into examining the material to try to analyse what is new. Is there new material? Is it different from the evidence presented previously? It is complex. If it was simple it would have been done before now, and I remind the Deputy that there have been two investigations already. We will be in contact with the committee again shortly and will be responding to the material that has been given. It is up to the committee then to come back to us.

There is an individual officer assigned to it who has put a huge amount of time and effort into going through the material and responding to many telephone calls and contact from the committee. That contact will be made, and we will revert to the members of the committee asking for comment on a variety of issues. With regard to the investigation, when I met the committee the members raised concerns with me which I do not want to put on the floor of the House now because they are the subject of the Garda investigation. When they were told to me I did say to the committee members that they should report any details they had relating to that particular issue to the Garda. There is a Garda investigation and it continues.

There is a deep sense of injustice in regard to the inquiries and reviews that have taken place over the years. My personal opinion, based on evidence I have seen, is that justice was not served. If I am correct, that is appalling because this tragedy resulted in the biggest loss of life in the history of the State. I appreciate that the Minister is facing a wide range of reviews and allegations across spectrums of Irish society, but this one is of huge importance not just to the families but to the Irish people. Whatever support the Minister's Department officials can give should be provided. The families have limited resources but what they have put together with those limited resources is impressive, and they deserve a chance to revisit this entire issue.

However, notwithstanding that, I have met the committee. I have got the new material. I want to have the fullest possible information available to me before making any decision as to how the issue might be progressed. I know the committee members are extremely anxious about this issue. As the Deputy said, it was the greatest loss of life in tragic circumstances. A draft preliminary examination of the material has now been completed. I will be going back to the committee and asking for the members' response, and I will then examine what they have to say.

This is reflected in the Policing Plan 2015. Effective action has been taken in the past and in recent times against many of the criminal gangs operating in this country, not least by the development of the Criminal Assets Bureau but also good quality Garda investigations, as evidenced by the fact that there are people currently serving time in prison in respect of 24 of the 25 murders carried out in Limerick.  The Garda Síochána has various programmes and targeted activities in place to tackle organised crime. These are designed to, as suggested by the Deputy, disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. This involves a great deal of international work as well. Increasingly, criminals are operating across borders and An Garda Síochána works closely with Interpol and Europol in this regard. That is very important. We are seeing significant results in terms of arrests being made and people being brought before the courts, as well as drugs and firearms seizures. Across the European Union, people are becoming increasingly concerned about the level of firearms smuggling taking place. I am in contact with the Garda Commissioner in regard to all aspects of serious crime, including the threat posed by criminal gangs. Criminal activity, in terms of the ever more sophisticated means being used by criminal gangs, is a challenge to every country. It is important that the Garda Síochána is well resourced. For this reason, we have invested in additional Garda vehicles and extra policing.

Are there any specific measures that might be employed to deter the enhancement of membership of criminal gangs, which young people find attractive? What measures are most effective in meeting that particular challenge? Is it education, further education or severe action against criminal gangs that is required? What is most likely to be effective?

There have been many significant drugs seizures here and abroad, including the seizure off the south west coast of Ireland last September of cocaine which had a street value of €358 million and the seizure off the Spanish coast of cocaine valued at €210 million, which is a clear indication that the operations of these criminal gangs is being interrupted. With regard to discouraging young people from involvement in criminal activity, this is a priority area. The Irish youth justice service and the Garda youth diversion projects nationwide do important work in this regard. Additional funding has been made available this year from the Dormant Accounts Fund to enable expansion of the network of diversion programmes countrywide, thereby ensuring the availability of additional youth workers to work with An Garda Síochána across communities in identifying young people at risk and ensuring they can be diverted from the life of crime, about which the Deputy has spoken.

It is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking simply to outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Chief among these is that such gangs do not have quite the same permanency as proscribed organisations in terms of organisation and structure. Such matters are kept under review but the most effective disincentive to this type of activity is effective policing, disruption of activities and seizure of goods. The Criminal Assets Bureau, as I said, has had a huge impact over the years in targeting property. That approach continues to be an effective way of dealing with criminal gangs.

Unfortunately, gangland crime has raised its ugly head once again in the city, with an attempted hit last week on a former gangland figure next to the sports campus at the University of Limerick. There is huge concern among people there at the potential re-emergence of gangland violence following a period of relative calm in the wake of the incarceration of a large number of gangland figures. The potential reputational damage to Limerick if this type of activity is allowed to happen again is hugely concerning for both tourism and business. Will the Minister find time to come to Limerick to meet gardaí working on the front line, business people, those working in tourism and residents? They would welcome her reassurance that this is a priority issue for her Department.

I commend the people of Limerick who have co-operated with An Garda Síochána. That engagement helped to ensure the imprisonment of those responsible for the heinous crimes, including murder, that were committed there. An investigation is under way into the situation to which the Deputy referred and a person has been arrested in connection with it. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further other than to encourage people who might have information to come forward. It was through that combination of Garda work and community co-operation that those crimes were dealt with effectively in the past. The only way to deal with this type of criminal activity is through a very robust response from the Garda Síochána and from communities.

Specifically, my concern is whether members of the force are adequately resourced to facilitate mobile policing, particularly in rural areas and areas where there are high levels of tourism-related activity in the summer months.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	62	The Government has invested nearly €29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, marking a massive increase on the €4.8 million provided by the previous Government. We have had 370 new Garda vehicles come on stream since the start of this year. In addition, I recently secured sanction for a further €700,000 for the purchase of new specialised response vehicles to support gardaí in reacting to current and emerging crime threats, including those committed by highly mobile gangs.
There is a growing problem with mobile gangs moving from one location to another. The best way to combat this is by ensuring gardaí have the resources they need to facilitate mobile capability in intercepting such crimes. The Garda has had a very high success rate in apprehending burglaries and so on. However, it has been brought to my attention that there is a need for stronger sanction in respect of such crimes. To that end, I will be introducing stronger legislation dealing with bail for serial offenders.Serious and serial offending has to be dealt with by imprisonment; that is the reality. Consecutive rather than concurrent sentences can be imposed for such offences. The allocation of the resources of An Garda Síochána is an operational matter.  On resources for the Garda, one of the major gaps which has never been dealt with in this country is the question of appropriate ICT. This Government has taken action and will respond to the Garda Inspectorate's report. I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on appropriate levels of investment in ICT for An Garda Síochána because there will be more effective rostering and operational decision making when the ICT to support effective policing is in place.

I also welcome her commitment and that of her predecessor on the investment in An Garda Síochána in terms of reopening Templemore, the new recruits - some 550 are now in training - and the investment in Garda cars.  In rural areas, the visibility of gardaí, in terms of the presence of a Garda car or cars in a locality, is very important in terms of making people feel there is an effective police presence and that they are more secure in their homes, particularly elderly people. There needs to be continuous investment in gardaí and Garda vehicles and resources because it is very important for people's peace of mind, in particular those living in rural areas. I refer to the regular meetings the Minister might have with the Garda Commissioner or assistant commissioners. Do they get down to the nitty gritty, such as Garda divisional levels, recruits, concerns that might be brought to her attention and areas that would benefit from more recruits or vehicles?

I understand the Deputy's point on rural communities. The change in policing in terms of more focus on mobile units is in no way intended to detract from community policing, which is essential in urban and rural and gardaí are committed to that. Given the changing nature of criminal activity, the gardaí have to be very agile in responding to the type of crime we are now seeing.  I have met many representatives from communities in rural areas in the past year and have been very impressed by what they are doing. There is great community involvement in working with the Garda on the text alert system, which has been very effective in many rural communities. I reassure the Deputy that there is as much a focus as ever on community policing in the rural context, but the way in which it has been done has changed. As I said, gardaí have been given the resources to respond in a more agile way to the crimes that have been committed by mobile gangs.

A progress report was sought. The Minister told us there were delays and initially she thought it would take eight weeks. In turned into a year because, she said, extra information was sought. My question deals with the number of such cases in which extra information was sought and the status of the cases before the mechanism.

The criteria were wide and the timeframe turned out to be quite different from what I indicated at the beginning, given the scale of the cases that were referred and the mechanism I set up. It is the first time a government has taken steps to examine a range of cases of concern to a variety of people, including Deputies. It was an unprecedented exercise which had not been previously attempted.It provides an independent, objective and consistent approach to dealing with these complaints. A total of 320 complaints were referred. The Deputy knows the process of the independent review mechanism so I will not go over it again. Counsel are totally independent of my Department and they determine the steps necessary to review each case. They have the facility to request my Department to seek further information from the complainant or from other bodies which they believe may hold information relevant to their considerations. Further information was provided by complainants in over 200 cases. In recent months, a huge amount of material was continuously submitted by complainants which had then to be examined through the independent review mechanism. Information was also requested through my Department at the request of the panel from the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in approximately 80 cases. I have asked a judge to review the reports going out to individuals. The judge has examined quite a number of cases at this point and, in many cases, the reports have been sent out.

Subsequent to the question being tabled some of the people who made complaints have begun to get replies, and to say what they received is beyond their worst expectations is probably an understatement. The letters I have seen from the panel represent a re-abuse of people badly let down by the system. I am speaking about cases of unexplained deaths which family members believe to be murder, as in the case of James Goonan, where the reply of the panel to the family was that it was very sorry for the family's loss but that the family's problem seemed to be that the Garda did not investigate the murder properly. The panel concluded that it would not ask the Garda to reinvestigate it, which would have been bad enough, but ask the Commissioner for a report. That was the outcome of a year's deliberation in the case of an horrific death of an elderly gentleman. A woman spoke to me this morning about sexual abuse allegations involving her two children which were not investigated. The answer she received was that the case went to the DPP and that was it. The whole point behind this was that people had problems with the investigative process, be it with the DPP or Garda, and to get an answer such as this exposes the entire system.

The 300 cases varied considerably. Some were about property, some had been before the Supreme Court, some were historical cases from 20 years ago or more and some were more recent. In every case the panel examined the material independently and objectively. Approximately 80% of the cases have finished. Some came in more recently so they are not finished. Replies have started to be issued to the complainants. An independent judge has examined the summary from the panel and has looked at the letters which have summarised the work of the panel. There are many references to third parties so the entire material cannot be sent out. The review panel put in place is objective and fair. I cannot go over the details of each case with the Deputy. She may cite the details of individual cases but I am not in a position to go into the reasons and I owe it to the complainants to give them as much information as I can. I cannot respond to particular cases highlighted by the Deputy. An independent process was put in place which was fair and which independently reviewed all of the material, which has never been done before. Recommendations in many of the cases will be made for further action of varying types. Some cases will be referred to An Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána will have new protocols. In certain instances, GSOC will be asked to conduct an investigation where there was never an investigation before. There is a variety of responses to individual cases. I am not in a position to respond to the individual cases. It would not be appropriate for me to do so. I can describe the fair process put in place with an independent panel.

I would like her to re-examine the figures and statistics she gave. It is precisely out of respect for the complainants that I raise these queries. People such as the family of John Kelly are outside in the lashing rain because their brother's death has never been explained. We put out a call last time we had Question Time to ask many of the hundreds of people who submitted those complaints whether any of them had been asked for extra information or had any of them resubmitted extra information and been examined on it. People came back and all said not in their case. We are aware of many cases like the Tuohey family where evidence came to light and the panel patently refused to look at it. I do not believe the process carried out any serious examination. This side of the House raised concerns that it was an attempt to divert attention from the growing anger among some of the families for justice. Of the replies we have seen so far, there has not been one, and the Minister did not answer how many of the cases have been concluded, because none of the conclusions we have seen, and we have begun to see many, would accept the viewpoint the Minister has put forward.

That is the fact of the matter. I do not know with which complainants the Deputy is in touch. I accept her bona fides but I am telling her more than 200 gave further information. The process of the independent review is not a commission of investigation or an inquiry designed to make findings such as a commission would. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed. I have given an indication of the type of further action recommended in some of the cases which have been seen. The letters have begun to go out on the cases which are completed and this process has been overseen by an independent judge.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	72	I am sure the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will agree at this stage there has been enormous concern about the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan book to Cerberus Capital Management. This was raised in the Dáil last week by Deputy Mick Wallace, who raised serious concerns and made serious allegations. We know BBC Northern Ireland has carried out an extensive investigation in a programme yet to be aired, but some of its people have already spoken about it. Many statements have been publicly made by key stakeholders involved, and various leading politicians have denied any involvement whatsoever. I am minded of the remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in April 2014.He asked the agency to conduct a review with a view to accelerating the sale of its loan book and bundling properties together. He stated: "I have asked [NAMA] if they have any suggestions on how we could work that and would it be possible to use it as a brake on the market." By this, he was asking what would be the consequences at the end of 2015 of taking the residual NAMA book and doing what IBRC did to its residual book in selling it off in a six-month period. One might now argue that one of the consequences was the kind of deal done with Project Eagle, where the entire Northern Ireland property portfolio of NAMA was put into one bundle and sold at a loss of around €200 million to NAMA and a discount of approximately 72%. We now know that, essentially, £7 million ended up in an Isle of Man bank account. That is not contested. We know the money was in an account controlled by a former managing partner of Belfast law firm Tughans, which acted indirectly for Cerberus, the US investment firm that bought the loan book. We know Pimco, another large US firm, withdrew from a tender process for the same loan book, citing concerns about an unsolicited approach from a number of individuals.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	73	A question, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	74	It notified NAMA about the unsolicited attention and, as part of its due diligence process, pulled out because of concerns that it had. NAMA has confirmed that Pimco's compliance staff discovered that its proposed fee arrangement with US law firm Brown Rudnick also included the payment of fees to Tughans and a former external member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee. This is in the public domain and I am not naming any names. Tughans has now stated that a former partner diverted the professional fees into an account without the knowledge of other partners. Suffice it to say that this is very serious and profound stuff that goes to the very heart of whether a proper deal was done on behalf of the taxpayer. I acknowledge that we have had many different commissions of investigation established but, given the gravity of what has been alleged and what we already know publicly or NAMA has confirmed, a commission of investigation is urgently required to investigate this entire episode involving the sale of the Northern Ireland loan book to the company concerned. Has the Government made a decision to set up such a commission of investigation?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	75	I thank the Deputy for his question. First, it is important to say that NAMA has a very clear public mandate to deliver best value and in that role it is very actively overseen by the Oireachtas. There is an embedded member of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office working with NAMA, it conducts regular audits and representatives come to the Committee of Public Accounts on a quarterly basis with information. I understand NAMA representatives will be before the Committee of Public Accounts this Thursday, and there will be an opportunity for members of that important committee of the House to question those representatives on the way NAMA manages its affairs. The issues raised and which are a cause of public concern regarding the destination of a fee are an entirely different matter. It is important to understand the way in which NAMA dealt with this. When it heard there was interest in the loan book, NAMA insisted there would be a competitive process and one of the companies involved, as the Deputy knows, was Pimco. It indicated that its compliance staff had uncovered a proposed fee arrangement and when this came to the attention of NAMA, it decided that if Pimco did not withdraw from the sale, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process. On foot of that, Pimco withdrew from the sale. NAMA also sought assurances, I understand, in respect of the successful bidder in this project that there was no such arrangement in place. It received such assurances. NAMA has discharged its business in a very thorough way. The issues raised by the Deputy in respect of the decisions made by the NAMA board on whether to sell loans individually or in a bundle are a legitimate matter for questioning at the Committee of Public Accounts. The representative of the Comptroller and Auditor General would have been across that decision at all stages and would have been involved with the auditing of the decision as it was made. This information on how the business was conducted is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General and it would be available to the Committee of Public Accounts. NAMA's representatives will be before the committee on Thursday.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	76	That is not a satisfactory answer in any shape or form. This is not about a routine appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not the subject of a routine audit. The timeline is very important. The fee arrangement mentioned by the Minister necessitated the withdrawal of Pimco was brought to the attention of NAMA by Pimco, by the way. No auditor or anybody else discovered that. Representatives of Pimco went to NAMA and indicated that its compliance personnel were very concerned about the unsolicited approaches, the nature of those approaches and the fee arrangements. Within a month, NAMA sold the package to another major investment company, Cerberus, apparently with a similar fee arrangement process in place and with the diversion of up to £7 million into an Isle of Man bank account. It is glaringly obvious that this demands a very serious, independent and objective inquiry, with compellability, into the specifics of this issue. Very serious allegations have been made about what transpired and there are many unanswered questions. This is entirely unsatisfactory. This concerns the largest property sale ever on the island of Ireland, with 850 properties being bundled together and many intermediaries involved. A person was allegedly operating in a discrete office within the Tughans building and people who served on the Northern Ireland advisory committee of NAMA were involved with this issue. That is very serious and I do not buy the line that NAMA just accepted assurances, with that being the end of the matter. It is not the end of the matter. Just as with previous occasions, the Government has been slow to come to the mark on issues like this. I put it to the Minister that the Government must review its response to the issue and establish a commission of investigation to get to the truth.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	77	It is important to point out to the Deputy that the fee arrangement to which he refers did not involve NAMA in any way.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	81	The issue of how NAMA conducted its business is very clear. That has been overseen and supervised by the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has somebody embedded in NAMA. NAMA's board is appointed by the Oireachtas to get best value and to have this level of Oireachtas oversight. We have a unique level of Oireachtas oversight with respect to this body and the opportunities exist for Members to raise issues at the Committee of Public Accounts, where they have the support of the Comptroller and Auditor General, an expert in forensic accounting advice who is the auditor to NAMA and who will have gone through these issues. Thursday's meeting offers an opportunity to deal with the NAMA involvement. There are clearly other issues regarding fees paid on the other side of the trade and they are of public concern. I understand the Northern Ireland Assembly is investigating those, as is the Law Society, with respect to the solicitor involved. There are investigations of those matters under way.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	82	I have previously raised widespread concerns about the operation of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. This deals with billions of euro in public assets being sold to vulture capitalists behind closed doors and without any democratic oversight. NAMA has been ordered by the Government to wind up faster than its 2020 remit, which also raises concerns about a fire sale of assets; we have raised that issue here many times. Sinn Féin has little confidence that the Government is protecting the public interest.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was aware of concerns about the sale of NAMA's northern portfolio before it even happened because the matter was raised in the Dáil by an Teachta Pearse Doherty. Last week's allegations by an Teachta Mick Wallace suggest insider trading and political croneyism in that sale. These loans had a value of €4.5 billion, but NAMA allegedly sold them to the US vulture capital firm Cerberus for just €1.3 billion. Another US firm, Pimco, withdrew from the sales process in March last year after it brought to NAMA's attention an attempt by a former NAMA adviser, Frank Cushnahan, to solicit payments. Did NAMA report this whole business to the Minister? Did NAMA report to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the reasons for Pimco's withdrawal? If it did not, is that not a question that needs to be answered? If it did, just three weeks after the withdrawal of Pimco, how did the Cerberus deal proceed, considering the involvement of many of the same actors? Will the Minister accept that this latest scandal demands the establishment of a commission of investigation into the management and operation of NAMA?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	83	I do not accept that. We, as an Oireachtas, set up the asset management agency to recover maximum value for the Exchequer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	85	We put in place a board, chaired by the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, to conduct that business and it had a very clear mandate to deliver best value. It was not told how to conduct its sales or whether they should be done individually or bundled; it was told to secure best value. It was also to be overseen by the Oireachtas, via the Comptroller and Auditor General and through the PAC. A system was put in place to give it the necessary discretion to act in the interest of the taxpayer, to maximise value, but at the same time the Oireachtas had this oversight mechanism. It has pursued that faithfully and has reported faithfully in respect of this. On the issue of whether a sale of a loan realises the book value, as the Deputy knows - if he does not know he can consult the records of the House - often these banks had only a tiny proportion of the real value that was loaned in their books. That was the nature of the crash we experienced. There is no question that one can expect NAMA to realise the full book value of loans that were transferred to NAMA at a substantial haircut. I do not know what the haircut on individual loans was, nor is that a matter of public knowledge, but it is clear that they did not have anywhere near the book value. NAMA has dealt with this in the way I outlined by open tender. It was a competitive tender. It was overseen by the Comptroller and Auditor General's representative, it was subject to audit in the normal way and it was subject to a report back to the PAC. The issue of the involvement on the other side of the trade of possible fee structures was brought to the attention of NAMA's board. It acted properly to disallow the company that was bidding in such a way. It informed the Minister of its decision, as it should have, and it then proceeded, when the successful tender came through, to seek assurances that no such fee was being paid and it received those assurances from the successful bidder. NAMA has behaved properly in the way it has conducted its business and the record of the way it handled this speaks for itself.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	86	The Minister was told, therefore, and the sale proceeded, despite all these players still being involved. One of the conditions of the sale process of the northern portfolio, following the withdrawal of Pimco, was that no former director should receive payment as a result of NAMA transactions. However, we know the law firm involved in the Cerberus deal had £7 million lodged in an offshore account. That is an awful lot of public money. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, says he does not accept that there should be a commission of investigation into this. The Minister for Finance has been silent on these matters. I have asked him and I have written to him to make a statement and he has said nothing. I have seen time after time since I have come here that this Government messes about, prevaricates, puts things on the long finger, kicks them up the road and does not move smartly and sharply. Why would it not establish a commission of investigation? Why would it not let the issue be dealt with by those who have the authority, the ability, the resources and the capacity to deal with them? My other point is that the Government is proposing to parcel up all of NAMA's remaining portfolios, to be disposed of in one sale. I understand that Cerberus is a leading bidder in that. In the same week this scandal emerged, the Government introduced legislation to cut payments to lone parents. It brought in legislation to pickpocket citizens' income to pay its water charges and it increased the six figure pensions of former taoisigh and Ministers. Surely that type of zeal in dealing with ordinary people needs to be matched with a commitment to dealing with issues of corruption and graft that are causing so much anger. I ask him again to reflect on his answer and to establish a commission of investigation into the management and the operation of NAMA.

The Minister for Finance was informed that the board of NAMA had decided that the company that had this compliance problem should not participate. It was debarred. It was not the case, as Deputy Adams is trying to suggest to the House, that the Minister allowed this to go ahead despite such players being involved.

Already, the pre-budget submissions are coming in and no doubt the Government will want to show the growth, improvement and recovery, as it did with the spring economic statement. Just looking at two statistics from the spring economic statement, the general Government debt is down to 105% of GDP and it is expected to go down by another percentage, and GDP growth last year in Ireland was the highest in Europe. What do those statistics mean in real terms to Irish people? What is being presented statistically as improvement, indicating the healthy state of the economy, is actually masking the reality in Ireland. The fine rhetoric and the statistics would give the impression that we are a template of how to turn a financial crisis around. No doubt it has been turned around for some people, but those statistics are masking the suffering of Irish people. I am talking about those on low incomes, lone parents and people with disabilities. I am talking about a community sector working on a shoestring budget and yet providing valuable services in child care, education and in addiction services.In terms of housing, 3,300 people in Dublin alone are in emergency accommodation and the Dublin City Council housing manager states it cannot cope such is the extent of the problem. Looking at the disconnect, we have the growth and the health of the economy statistics and the reality. How can the statistics mask the reality? I suggest the answer lies in the way we measure poverty and that the current system is unbalanced. One statistic from the current system is that 6.2% of people are in consistent poverty. There are parts of Dublin Central and other parts of the country where the number in consistent poverty is double or treble that. We need to look beyond mere economic indicators as the only indicators determining our prosperity and well-being. For example, in the gross national happiness index, there are 33 indicators, including health, education, socio-cultural participation, community vitality and ecological diversity.  Does the Minister accept the need to look beyond a simplistic monetary measure as the sole indicator so that the Government will have real and comprehensive information about people's lives that would guide policy for the next budget?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	100	I certainly do but I would also say there is tangible improvement occurring. There are now 105,000 more people at work since we started the Action Plan for Jobs. That is 105,000 people's lives back on track. It is also 105,000 people who are contributing on average €20,000 per year into the Exchequer in terms of savings, which amounts to €2 billion available to the Exchequer to deal with many pressing problems. As the Deputy will be aware, 2015 was written down for another year of cuts, had the troika forecast been accurate, but instead, because we have made progress on employment and other adjustments, we have been able to put money back this year. We have put money back into special needs. We have made provision in health and in many areas of pressing need. We have increased the budgets for the homeless by 22%. Certainly, it is not enough. The economy is a work in progress. I certainly will not rest still until we get back to full employment. We can deliver that by 2018 but it means we have to continue to deliver policies that will allow that sort of growth. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is correct to say that we need to have broader measures of economic welfare than simply economic ones and that we need those wide indicators of sustainability, etc. That is part of the way in which we need to develop impact indicators. Many Departments are developing such impact indicators and, increasingly, they are working to indicators and publish them along with the Estimates so that people can see the impact of how the money is being spent on important measures of performance. I agree with the Deputy that we need to have those broader measures but that cannot deviate from the fact that had we not got 105,000 people back to work, we would not have €2 billion to put back to provide some relief for families for the impact of the past number of years.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	101	A drop in unemployment figures is always welcome but some of those who are now employed are working on wages that do not allow them to live in dignity; it is not a living wage. Returning to the measure, within the EU, poverty is measured by using relative income poverty lines which involves working out an average or median household income. However, there is a limitation in that regard. In choosing a cut-off point, it is arbitrary and it does not take other factors into account - for example, how far below the poverty threshold people are and the length of time that people have been poor. Therefore, we are not getting a comprehensive picture of the intensity, duration and persistence of poverty and there is a need for other measures that would provide a holistic approach to give a true picture of poverty. I referred to children living in consistent poverty and we know from the organisations working with them that there has been an increase. That did not happen by accident but came about because of Government policy. If poverty and inequality are to be really reduced and not only statistically, then the Government needs that comprehensive accurate information to guide policy and that is not coming from the current framework for measuring poverty. As long as that continues, the disconnect will also continue between what the statistics say and the reality on the ground.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	102	I agree we can always refine the measures. The measure that struck me most dramatically from my recent reading of the poverty report was the dramatic reduction of poverty for people who go back to work. The risk of poverty is seven times higher if one is out of work than if one is in work. The progress that the strategy has delivered, through Pathways to Work and Action Plan for Jobs, to get people back into employment has made an impact. Some 141,000 people left the live register last year to enter employment and they saw their opportunities improve. It is not the case that these are all part-time jobs. Some 91% of those additional 105,000 jobs are full-time. Most of them are in strong well-paying sectors, such as ICT, manufacturing, construction and financial services. They are right across the spectrum. There are some in retail and in hospitality where pay levels would not be as high, but we are now in a position to establish a Low Pay Commission to look at the pay levels of those who are on low pay and to gradually, over time and based on evidence, increase those payments. There is a dividend coming through as we get our economy back on track. I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that we need a wider range of measures. I know from colleagues that people are straining at the leash to be able to invest more in services but we can do that only as we deliver the dividend that is coming from our successful economic approach.

Four years ago, the Government spoke about a democratic revolution, giving Parliament more independence and having more respect for it.

Meanwhile, the crisis facing the health service continues. In particular, overcrowding in emergency departments is at an all-time high since records began. The number of people waiting on trolleys in St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin is up 332% on the June 2014 figure at 484. In Waterford, the figure is up 178% on the June 2014 figure, a marked increase in the level of overcrowding. The number at Beaumont Hospital is up 150% at 757. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, should know that well. In Limerick, the figure is up 80%; in Galway, it is up 59%; in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, it is up 42%; and it is up 36% in Connolly Hospital. The Minister talks about universal care now instead of a universal insurance system. Liam Doran, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, says that the level of deterioration, the resulting compromising of patient care and excessive workloads on working staff contained in these figures is truly shocking. He says that what has been done to date has failed to address the problem, which continues to grow, and that it is the worst June in terms of overcrowding since the INMO began counting trolleys in 2004. I listened with great attention to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, last Saturday when he again spoke like a detached commentator, which has become synonymous with his term in office as Minister for Health. The programme for Government outlines an extensive list of proposed legislation relating to the hospital system and particularly the application of universal health insurance to that system. Is that legislation now shelved? Are all the legislative commitments in the programme for Government relating to health shelved in light of the Minister's comments? When will we see legislation on patient safety, particularly patients who are ending up on trolleys in such large numbers in the middle of summer?

Will the Government allocate time on Wednesday for a debate on the referendum in Greece? It is one of the seismic events in the history of the European Union. A very courageous stance was taken by Greek citizens. The vote rejects austerity and is an endorsement of efforts to secure a debt write-down. Given the consequences for the EU and particularly for citizens of this State, I ask the Government to allocate time to debate it. The other issue I wish to raise is the Haddington Road agreement. Will the Minister confirm that former Ministers and taoisigh are to get an increase in their pensions under this agreement as part of a side deal agreed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin? Last week, the Fine Gael and Labour parties voted in favour of taking money out of the pockets of lone parents and today the Dáil will debate the civil debt Bill, which allows money to be taken out of wages, welfare payments and pensions to pay for water charges and other utility bills. Meanwhile, Dublin City Council is facing a shortfall of €18.5 million for tackling the homelessness problem and will run out of money in October. A total of 67 families were made homeless in Dublin in May and 65 were made homeless in June, while there are over 1,000 homeless children. The House should consider this in the context of the new pension agreements for Ministers and former Ministers and taoisigh and the Minister's claim that he cannot prevent it. Will the Minister accept that significantly increasing pensions for politicians is entirely unacceptable? Has any of this been equality proofed? Will the Government take whatever steps are appropriate to reverse this situation?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	182	When the Taoiseach returns following those discussions, I hope there will be an opportunity for a debate on the Greek issue. We wait to hear what the Greek Government will put forward. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are clearly open to hearing proposals. Ireland has a good record in the approach it took. We managed to get debt relief through longer maturities and lower interest rates. That saved the Irish taxpayer a large sum of money and gave us the space to have a growth strategy which has got 100,000 people back to work. There is capacity to manage a deal, but a deal must be agreed with the partners. There must be a strategy with which everybody agrees and I hope today offers an opportunity to make progress on that. On the second question, there was no side deal in respect of politicians. The Deputy should look at the Government's track record. On every occasion the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Government have made decisions to reduce payments to politicians, to reduce pensions and special payments and to give up severance payments that applied to politicians in the past. The approach to this deal has been the same.

I am referring in the main to Gheel Autism Services in Dublin 3, but I have also heard of cuts to services at St. Michael's House, Baldoyle, and other disability services nationally. I ask the Minister what exactly is going on. Where is all the talk of equality and social inclusion while services are being ripped apart? There may be no services for many of these physically and intellectually disabled young adults in September. Imagine TCD or UCD students were treated in such a manner. Imagine third level students were told in such a way that there would be no services for them in the autumn. There would, rightly, be uproar. Today, we must focus on providing services at Gheel Autism Services in Fairview, Dublin 3. We seem to be able to find the money for increases for politicians and for increases in the pensions of former Ministers. In particular, I refer to a case that was notified to me by a parent. She wrote to me with regard to her daughter who has just graduated from St. Paul's special school for children with autism in Beaumont and who was listed to commence an adult placement in September with Gheel Autism Services in Fairview. A number of parents were called to a meeting with the director of Gheel Autism Services on Tuesday, 13 June. They were informed that due to insufficient funding from the HSE, Gheel Autism Services would be unable to offer placements to their children in September. He also said the board of Gheel Autism Services was not prepared to offer unsafe services to new clients. It is an impossible situation for that parent to leave her daughter at home to regress after all the progress that has been made. It is simply not an option. I ask the Minister to listen to the parents. There were 28 parents at the meeting to which I have referred and many of them are very upset and distressed. Another parent approached me who was affected by cuts to services at St. Michael's House, Baldoyle. That parent received notification of receiving a ten-day support service through July and August which is a total breach of an agreement that was made with parents. Last year, the parent received support services for over three weeks in July and for the second half of August, which amounted to approximately 40 days in total. That is a reduction of 66% in services. As such, the Minister must listen to these families very carefully. The chief executive of Gheel Autism Services has responded to the HSE in relation to the insufficient funds allocated to meet needs and to ensure the service is in a financial position to provide quality, safe services for the sons and daughters of these families on a full-time basis. The timeframe of 1 September is incredibly tight to guarantee the commencement of day services. The service providers are saying they will endeavour to work towards this deadline but there are a number of confounding factors which must be considered. There is a further problem in that the rental market in Dublin is highly competitive currently. I urge the Minister to listen to these parents of young adults with intellectual and physical disabilities who deserve the services as a right.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	198	I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for raising this issue. I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is abroad on Government business. The Health Service Executive allocates funding to Gheel Autism Services under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 on foot of a service agreement, which is reviewed on an annual basis. In 2014, the agency received funding of €6 million from the HSE for a range of services, including day, residential, respite and outreach services for adults with autism. I understand that the funding issue raised by the Deputy has been highlighted by the need to provide new placements for young people with disabilities leaving school this year. In that context, full-year funding of €12 million was announced in the HSE's national service plan 2015 to meet the cost of providing new placements for school leavers and those graduating from rehabilitative training programmes this year. Some €6 million of this funding is available in 2015 and is being allocated to community health care organisation areas to meet identified needs in line with the HSE's policy on day services for adults with a disability, as outlined in the New Directions
report. An additional €1.5 million has since been added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of €13.5 million full-year costs to meet the needs of this cohort of young people. The HSE is working closely with Gheel Autism Services and has assured me that it has recently been informed that it is being allocated €708,000 to provide placements for 24 young people from 1 September. I understand that Gheel has indicated to the HSE that it does not believe that this funding is sufficient to cover the cost of leasing suitable premises for five hubs needed to accommodate these 24 young people. The HSE is very aware of the challenges faced by some service providers who may not have the physical capacity within their existing services to accommodate the new intake of school leavers in 2015 but are actively seeking appropriate accommodation to enable a service to commence this year. The HSE has been engaging locally and nationally with these providers, including Gheel, and will continue to work with them to resolve these issues.  In this context, a further €1.5 million once-off capital funding is being allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation. The HSE has invited applications from all service providers, including Gheel, who wish to avail of this funding and its decision on capital allocations will be notified to providers in a matter of days. The HSE recognises the valuable contribution Gheel Autism Services provides to people with autism, their families and carers. I am assured that the HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers, including Gheel, to ensure that the resources available for specialist disability services, including services for school leavers, are used in the most effective manner possible.

[that the funding is insufficient] to cover the cost of leasing suitable premises for five hubs needed to accommodate these 24 young people." He has accepted that they have a major problem. Does he accept that the HSE has offered funding at a level that is at least 50% lower than what was assessed on a needs basis by the Gheel service providers? Is he aware that Gheel carried out an in-depth study on the needs of each new service user and its own funding requirements in order to meet its capacity deficits to cater for the growth in autism referrals? This seems to have been ignored by the HSE. It is a simple mathematics exercise to correct the provision of a service. The HSE issued the New Directions policy in 2012, setting out what is the appropriate model of care for those with special needs and a separate policy document setting out the required provision for people with autism but it has left funding woefully short in contradiction of these new policy commitments. This is the first year in which adequate funding is not being provided. I cannot accept an inferior service to that of previous years for other school leavers. This means that school leavers, in particular, in previous years had the provision of a full service. It is the service provided to the children specifically that is being threatened. That is blatant discrimination.  The HSE has known about the number of school leavers in 2015 for many years, via primary school returns and the national intellectual disability database, and it has not done any planning to cater for the increase in the number despite recent policy documents stating otherwise. I would make the point again that if these were third level students in Trinity or UCD they would have an automatic access to such a service in the autumn, but this is not happening for young people with intellectual disability and that is blatant discrimination.

As I outlined, an additional €12 million has been provided for a full year in the national service plan, €1.5 million has been added to that and €6 million is available 2015, which is being allocated to the community health care organisation areas. Rather than cuts, additional money is being made available. In this particular case, €708,000 is being made available to provide new placements for 24 young people from 1 September. On a rough calculation, that is nearly 30,000 per client for four months, therefore, €30,000 is being provided for a four-month placement. It may well be the case that the organisation concerned believes that is insufficient and it may well be correct or it may not be correct. However, what needs to happen is an engagement involving the HSE managers on the ground who know that service well and know similar services well and who can work out whether it is practicable for that organisation to deliver that service for the amount of money that has been allocated, which is substantial.

This company had a dedicated workforce who worked hard over the years at this facility and this closure has come as a shock to them. It is a big blow also to the town of Clonmel and the surrounding area. This closure is a concern because it is part of a pattern of job losses in Tipperary over the last period, including the significant reduction in jobs at the Cantrell & Cochrane, C&C, site, the Bulmers plant, which is also the site of the location of the Grant's facility. There has been significant job losses there, an undermining of terms and conditions of employment and the transfer of production from the site. There has also been job losses - some 12 jobs - at Gleeson's in Borrisoleigh, another C&C facility, and 20 job losses nationally in administration and sales in C&C. There was a significant loss of 200 jobs at Intellicom in Clonmel in the recent past and also the closure of the Fairgreen supermarket in Carrick-on-Suir. Last Friday, Oireachtas Members from south Tipperary met the company, Grant's, and a number of disturbing elements arose, particularly the fact that the company had not made contact with the Minister's Department or with any jobs agencies either locally or nationally. Also, the jobs agencies under the Minister's Department have given the company grants to build a distillery in Tullamore. In other words, the Government has subsidised the transfer of jobs from Clonmel to Tullamore and, worse still, the Minister's Department took no steps to ensure the continuation of production of Tullamore Dew or an alternative product at the Clonmel facility. What steps will the Minister take now to ensure that this closure is averted and that those jobs are saved?

Some 6,452 people are unemployed in south Tipperary and 7,995 people are unemployed in north Tipperary. The blow of the loss of these jobs to Clonmel is huge. I compliment the employees in Grant's, wish them well and also sympathise with them. Grant's has moved from Clonmel. Action is needed now to work on developing opportunities in other areas. I appeal to the Minister, who is sitting beside his Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to stop the nonsense of his Cabinet colleague who, as we find today, is going around the globe, out in the United Nations. He is like an apostle. He might even go to Rome altogether and announce in the Vatican that he has found employment for Cashel. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is working with all of us to try to fill the Johnson & Johnson factory in Cashel. We do not need Allah coming along and telling us that he has it filled and wheeling out a former ambassador to back up his claim. This is ridiculous. I appeal to the Minister and his colleagues to reign in this desperate Minister. That is what he is because, as I said last week, he would turn up for the opening of a can of Coke. He is insisting on boards of management opening schools. He is ringing the schools and giving them misinformation.His colleagues should rein him in and tell him to cop on to himself. This is a serious business we are in, and he should not be making high profile statements.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	207	I thank the Deputies for raising the matter. I am very conscious that the announcement of a possible transfer of the operation in Clonmel by the company creates problems for the workers there, and my first thoughts are with those workers and their families, as well as the members of the local community, who have received this very difficult news. I understand the company concerned was started in 1886 in Scotland and is still family owned. The company is the third largest producer of Scotch whisky. The company made a strategic decision to broaden its spirits portfolio beyond Scotch and, in 2010, bought the Clonmel based spirits business of C&C. This comprised the brands of Tullamore Dew, Carolan's Irish Cream liquor and Irish Mist. It subsequently sold the last two to Campari. This gave the company the Tullamore Dew brand and production, and it is enabled by long-term agreements with other whiskey suppliers. This was always going to be a temporary arrangement as, long-term, the company would not rely on direct competitors for whiskey. The company continued to bottle Tullamore Dew on the C&C site in Clonmel. In addition, a co-packing arrangement was included on the Clonmel site bottling Carolan's Irish Cream liquor and Irish Mist liquor. The company subsequently decided to set up its own distillery. The first phase, completed in late 2014, is for a malt and unmalted distillery at a total investment of €35 million. I am aware that the second phase to build a grain distillery is currently under way. I understand that the activities concerning Tullamore Dew, which historically have been located in Clonmel, will now be transferred to Tullamore and integrated into the new distillery facility. The co-packing arrangement was reviewed in September 2014 and the company lost the contract. The notice to terminate will take effect from September 2015. There are 50 jobs concerned and redeployment to Tullamore, as well as the timing of the relocation of businesses, is now subject to discussions with employees. On completion of the distillery and supporting service in Tullamore, it is estimated that the employment will grow on that site from a base of 66 in 2014 to 107 by 2019. I should point out that the company reiterates that it has consistently communicated with its employees about the long-term future of the business.  In regard to any possible job losses, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation which offers extensive protections to employees. The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is mandated to ensure compliance with employment rights and it will be available to assist workers. The Workplace Relations Commission can be contacted as well in terms of assistance and any workers who need support will have access to the State agencies concerned. I can assure the Deputies that on the wider front employment in the county and the region has been very much to the fore. As they know, I decided earlier this year that we would develop regional action plans in all of our eight regions. I will be working on an action plan, both for the mid-west and the south east, as a part of that. We have put significant resources into that, and we are working with all stakeholders on the ground - chambers of commerce, agencies and education bodies - to ensure we get the very best ideas. The Deputies will be aware that competitive calls have been made, and the local enterprise office is an area from which competitive calls can be made. In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Lowry, I am aware of reports in the media that the former J&J factory in Clonmel has been sold to a United States pharmaceutical company. As the Deputy knows, this was not an IDA site. It was owned by J&J, and there have been a series of deals. IDA has been actively involved with all of the owners seeking to ensure that the best outcome would be secured for the prospect of bringing jobs to the site after the J&J closure. That continues to be the case. The IDA will work with the new owners but for reasons of commercial confidentiality, I am not at liberty to give any details of discussions that may be going on with the new owners. This is a very competitive business. No deal is ever done until it is finalised, and the IDA will work with the new owner to try to secure a good outcome for the area.

In the past three years, there was a net loss of 321 IDA jobs in the county. All towns in Tipperary have been excluded from the building of advanced factories and offices by the IDA. Tipperary is not getting its fair share of investment and job creation. The Minister's Department and the jobs agencies have been aware since 2012 that the Tullamore Dew facility at Clonmel was to cease operations. Effectively, he subsidised the transfer of jobs to Tullamore by way of giving grants for the distillery. In the current circumstances, will the Minister at least set up a jobs task force for the county to ensure that Tipperary gets its fair share of jobs investment into the future?

This is too serious a situation for elected representatives in Tipperary to be playing political football with it and travelling to Geneva, Hong Kong or wherever and making these announcements. I am talking about the Minister, Deputy Kelly. We need to respect the people who are unemployed. We need to support the small businesses in Tipperary which are giving employment. We have serious worries about C&C in Clonmel and Gleesons. We have issues and we should sit down, negotiate and support the families, the workers and self-employed people in Tipperary. We are lucky to have the farming industry. I hope something comes to Cashel but eaten bread is soon forgotten, and I will not believe anything until I see jobs in place there. Whatever the Minister, Deputy Kelly, says is poppycock.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22759	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	211	I can assure the Deputies that I am absolutely committed to developing a balanced spread of employment throughout the country. It is encouraging to see that, for the first time, Tipperary has seen employment growth across our agencies - IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprises offices - and 260 additional people are at work in Tipperary in 2014 as a result of their efforts. That is a start, and we need to build on that. In terms of unemployment, it has come down by close to 3,000 in Tipperary. That is in sharp contrast to the previous period when 11,000 extra people became unemployed. We are making some progress. The decline in unemployment is around 17% in the county but I am very keen that more progress would be made, and that is the reason we have established the regional enterprise strategy. That gives the Deputies but also various stakeholders in the region an opportunity to become involved in developing proposals, and competitive calls are being made to assist people. To respond to Deputy Healy, the provision of support for the development of a distillery is not about displacing work elsewhere. This is a valuable asset that this country needs. There is a strong resurgence of distilleries here. For 100 years not a single distillery had been opened, and now there are close to 25 either in planning or being opened. It is a significant opportunity to use native grown material to develop a strong branded product that is inherent to our country and, therefore, it is something worth promoting. It is disappointing to see jobs lost in any situation but I assure the Deputy that the grants provided to support a distillery is not to displace people elsewhere. I thank Deputy Lowry for his encouragement. I assure him that my determination is to see a good outcome.It was very disappointing when J&J pulled out of the business there. It was quite unexpected, it being such a significant player here. J&J is a tremendous investor in Ireland. It has disposed of this plant but I am hopeful we will be able to work on this.

The title of the committee, namely, the Carlow boundary committee, gives the game away. I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to abandon this process now and not cause unnecessary divisions on a matter long since closed. There is no need for this to be done. I am strongly critical of the Minister opening up this debate and allowing for unnecessary divisions at local level between people who live close to the boundary between Laois and Carlow. Laois and Carlow counties work excellently as good local neighbours. Good local neighbours should not be encroaching on each other's areas. There is no reason for this to be done.  I have previously instanced another example of this in my own constituency. The River Barrow runs through Laois and Carlow and is the county boundary for much of the area, although not the entire area. Further up, the River Barrow runs through the town of Portarlington, part of which is in County Laois and the other part of which is in County Offaly. There is never a problem in dealing with Portarlington issues because both councils work excellently as good neighbours for the good of Portarlington. The same approach should be taken in relation to the area known as Graiguecullen, which is part of County Laois but adjacent to Carlow town. The two counties can work excellently as good neighbours, as they have always done. My question for the Minister is: who, or what, is behind this move to change the county boundary for no good reason? We will do all in our power to stop this happening. I do not want to hear about opportunities for people to make representations to the boundary committee as this process should not go ahead. It should be closed down. Nobody in County Laois has asked for this to be done. We want to know why the Minister will not leave well enough alone. As I have already stated, the terms of reference mention the Carlow boundary committee. They also state that if there are to be changes to the county boundaries the impact of this on the municipal district of Carlow must be taken into account. However, there is no mention in the terms of reference of the impact of any proposed change to the county boundaries on the municipal district of County Laois. If part of Laois is moved into County Carlow, this will impact on the Graigueullen-Portarlington municipal district in County Laois. There is no mention in the terms of reference of the part of Laois that will be affected. I will challenge the Minister in regard to biased terms of reference that are not objective in that they reference only changes to the municipal district in Carlow. It is not possible to change the Portarlington-Graiguecullen municipal district boundary between Laois and Carlow without impacting on the Portarlington or Graiguecullen-Portarlington municipal district.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is well aware of what is involved in this regard given the moves to change the county boundary between Drogheda and Meath. The same is happening in Waterford in terms of Waterford wanting to take over part of south Kilkenny. Counties can work well enough together but why is the Minister setting neighbours against each other for no good reason? I want to know who is behind this proposal? For as long as I have been a Deputy, this has been a live issue. It comes up every five years and eventually goes away. I intend to get to the bottom of what group of officials resurrects this issue every five years after it has been put to bed. This is not necessary. Counties Carlow and Laois are good neighbours and they want to remain so. Good neighbours should not be encroaching on each other's area. The Minister should stop this process now.

I thank Deputy Fleming for the opportunity to update the House on this matter. As Members are aware, on 19 June last, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford. In the case of Carlow, the committee has been asked to carry out a review of the boundary between County Carlow and County Laois and to make recommendations with respect to that boundary and any consequential recommendations to the area of the municipal district of Carlow that it considers to be necessary in the interests of effective and convenient local government.  The main rationale for undertaking the review of boundaries in Carlow is that there is a significant overspill of population into County Laois, based on the population figures taken from the 2011 census. The logic of a boundary alteration, if recommended, would be to bring the administrative jurisdictions into line with the current settlement and development position. Bringing an entire town or city within a single local authority area eliminates anomalies and distortions of divided administration, service provision, regulatory and enforcement responsibility and electoral representation, including problems such as competitive policies and practices between authorities in relation to planning, rating and charges, which can impact negatively on town centres. Differences in standards of service delivery can also be eliminated. It is also usual to extend the boundary to include not only existing development but an additional area to allow for future expansion and to avoid further boundary-related anomalies in the foreseeable future. Consolidation of administrative responsibility can also strengthen the economic performance of the town by eliminating the anomalies to which I have referred and ensuring that there is a single authority working on its behalf. The committee has been established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991. Full details of the terms of reference and membership are available on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government website. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, is delighted that people of such strong calibre and experience of local government were willing to come forward on a pro bono basis and assist in settling administrative boundaries for this area.  I have noted the questions posed by the Deputy in relation to the terms of reference. I wish to assure him that I will raise them directly with the Minister on his behalf.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	214	I thank the Minister of State for the response and acknowledge the apologies from the Minister for not being here. First, this process will result in further anomalies as Dáil boundaries in the area correspond with the current county boundaries. Since what is proposed will not change the Dáil boundaries, this will result in the creation of an anomaly whereby we will have different local authority boundaries for county purposes, in terms of local authority administration, relative to the Dáil constituency boundaries, leading to the need for further changes into the future. Second, in regard to the committee, I propose to inquire about its members and their respective interests, roles and knowledge of these areas and if they have ever offered a view on these issues in the past. In the reply prepared by the Department, the Minister of State referred to a significant overspill of population from Carlow into County Laois, which is very disturbing. Is it being suggested that Carlow is so full there is nowhere for people to live there and as such they are spilling over into County Laois? That is extraordinary. The problem for Laois, in terms of Carlow, is that the town to the eastern side of Carlow is not being developed. Carlow County Council likes to develop the western side of the town which happens to be in County Laois. However, as I said earlier, we have worked jointly on ring-roads around the towns and are currently working jointly on sewerage schemes around the town. We have also worked jointly on housing issues. Two of Carlow County Council's social housing estates were built in County Laois rather than County Carlow. When it boils down to it, those involved in this process will not know the geography.  As I said earlier, part of the River Barrow runs through County Carlow. We will be demanding, if this process continues, that the county boundary be shoved back to the River Barrow, to where it was 100 years ago. We have allowed it encroach a little but will not allow it to encroach any further.

The majority of the provisions of that Act commenced with effect from 1 June 2014, and that date marked the activation of a range of significant changes in the local government system. Policy decisions to replace town authorities with a new model of municipal governance are at the core of the reform agenda. The model is designed to strengthen local government within counties and address widely acknowledged and long-standing weaknesses and anomalies in the previous system, including the problem of administration that is divided between town and county authorities. Municipal districts and borough districts, where they arise, now cover the entire territory of counties. As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system will, over time, result in more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation, with improved accountability and responsiveness to local needs. Moreover, under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication in both administrative and electoral terms. The establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Carlow and Laois is a natural and complementary development building on these changes. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, will study the report of the committees carefully after they have concluded their work at the end of February next year.

I understand the decision to close the facility was made in March and conveyed to staff at that time, but only became public knowledge in recent weeks. In recent days, local public representatives attended a meeting with the president of the college, Professor Philip Nolan, in an effort to persuade management to defer the closure until an alternative arrangement is found. There is a long-standing proposal to build a municipal swimming pool in the area, which is supported by all local government representatives and Oireachtas Members. The view is that it would be advantageous to have a discussion on the subject as quickly as possible. Earlier today, all local representatives received an e-mail from the college authorities indicating that it is not intended to defer the closure of the pool but that they are prepared to engage with the local authority to ascertain whether there might be a joint approach to providing a facility that could be used by the local community and the college. That proposal must be taken up. The local community has raised money for this purpose and the local authority has made preparations in that regard. I propose that the college authorities be called upon once more to defer their decision to close the pool and that negotiations be initiated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with the local authority and the local community to find a solution.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	217	There are only two municipal swimming pools in County Kildare, in Athy and Naas, serving a population of 210,000. The north Kildare towns of Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock have a combined population of some 60,000 and have become dependent on the very old pool on the NUI Maynooth campus. Some 800 children will be directly affected by the closure, having been told their classes will finish at the end of August. The area has a very large young population. As Deputy Durkan indicated, the three local Deputies have met with the college president to discuss the two main issues that arise out of the decision to close the college pool. The first issue is the need to put in place a municipal pool and the second is the short-term response that is required in terms of retaining the facility at the university. The president told us the university has no obligation to provide a public pool, that responsibility being one for the Government and the local authority. The primary purpose of the college, he noted, is one of education. The president indicated that the cost of the works required to restore the pool to the required condition, which include improvements to air-handling and the fabric of the pool, would be some €350,000. In the meantime, he said, the college is losing money on operational costs. The most important outcome of our meeting with the president, however, was his clear indication that the college does not want the risk of managing even an upgraded facility. In other words, it is not seeking the money needed to upgrade the pool. That is not the issue. The best we can hope for is that the college authorities might postpone the decision to close it. The e-mail to which Deputy Durkan referred, which was sent today, states that it is simply not possible for the college to reverse the decision to close the pool unless there is agreement on a joint development with Kildare County Council of a swimming pool that meets the needs of the university and the community, in which case the college authorities would be willing to examine any viable case to reopen the pool at Maynooth on an interim basis. This situation arose as a result of the closure of the swimming pool fund in 2000, with no prospect of its being reopened. There is a real need for action in this regard in north Kildare.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	218	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I was disappointed to learn of the closure of the swimming pool on the campus of NUI Maynooth. The Deputies will appreciate that this was a decision for the college authorities and not one in which I was involved. It is always a disappointment to see facilities close and I have no doubt this particular decision will be regretted by swimmers in Maynooth and the surrounding areas. Swimming provides a marvellous sporting opportunity for people of all ages and abilities. Given that so much swimming in Ireland takes place in indoor pools, it is also generally a weather-independent activity, a key advantage given our climate. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of the provision of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. Since 2000, 58 projects have been or are being dealt with under the scheme, of which 49 have been completed and the remaining nine are at various stages of development. The allocation of the maximum LASPP grant of €3.8 million is subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. There are many complex technical aspects involved in refurbishing or replacing a swimming pool. The whole process, from feasibility study to going on site, can and usually does take a number of years. That is before we even get to the construction of the facility; construction itself typically takes at least a further 18 months. A great amount of technical work by the local authorities is involved. Modern pools generally include attractive additional features such as saunas, steam rooms and toddler pools, thereby providing better long-term value for money and greater benefit to local communities. Due to changed economic circumstances, although building projects can in some cases be sourced at better rates, local authorities' funds from development levies and so on have decreased considerably, which has made the financing of pool projects very difficult. No decision has been made on the timing of a new round of the LASPP. The clear focus is on completing as many of the pools in the current round as possible. However, as we bring that round to a close, it will become clear that some pools will not take up their funding, which may give scope for a limited reopening of the LASPP, albeit on a more modest scale and with a limited number of projects. It would then be open to all local authorities to apply, including Kildare County Council. Factors such as population, local demand and existing access to pools will be a critical factor in deciding on the allocation of funding to projects under a reopened LASPP. That will not happen tomorrow or next week, but it is something of which I am very conscious. In 2011 and 2012, I allocated more than €14 million under an energy upgrade and enhanced disabled access initiative, under which grants of up to a maximum of €400,000 were allocated to pools. This scheme was a great success and I have witnessed its positive effects at first hand. In a time of high energy costs, these grants helped pools to reduce their operating costs and become more viable. As we all know, operating a swimming pool is a very expensive activity. Given the great success of that scheme, I launched another round recently and the applications received are currently being assessed. Such schemes are a clear recognition of the expense involved in running a swimming pool and the importance of ensuring those facilities remain open to provide a healthy activity for people of all ages and abilities. I am naturally disappointed to see the pool in Maynooth close, as I am when any such facility closes. As I said, I am aware of the demand for a new swimming pool in north Kildare. The area will be a prime candidate for a new pool when I have the opportunity and funding to open a new, limited round of the LASPP.

I ask him to consider, in the limited time available in this session, meeting the local authorities, Members and college authorities with a view to identifying the best possible options for the local community and the best possible value for money in the provision of facilities in the future, without tying anybody into a particular situation and recognising that the college authorities have a different source of revenue from the local community. Would it be possible to arrange that in the short time available? If so, Members and the college authorities would be anxious to be involved. I would strongly support the concept of a local or municipal pool if that were a possibility. I would also like to examine any possibility of deferring the closure, which would be a serious blow to the swimming clubs and members of the local community that have traditionally used the pool.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	220	The reason this very old pool is being discussed is the absence of what should have been provided given the population involved. No other county in the country has a population of more than 200,000 without a city in the middle. As the population grows, it is supposed to be provided with services. It may be a great idea to provide energy upgrades to other pools around the country, but that does not cut the mustard for the children who do not have swimming classes in their area. Once this goes, nothing else will be available. There is not even the hope of a pool. I have spoken to the Minister of State about this issue for the past four years. I accept that in the early years of the Government it was not possible to provide the money, but it is outrageous that some local authorities are sitting on an allocation that they are not in a position to use while other parts of the country are in need. Money could be diverted to deliver facilities in a more timely manner. This is a complete failure to provide for a need, and I do not hear a whole lot in what the Minister of State said that gives me a great deal of comfort. Nothing that will happen before the end of the Government's term gives us any hope of another pool.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	221	Deputies from Kildare have been raising this issue for a while. Let us be honest. In 2000 there was a scheme whereby 58 pools were selected, but there was no deadline for the closure of the scheme. My hands are tied. I have been conscious of the requests for swimming pools in certain areas with high populations. I met the County and City Managers' Association, which has no love of swimming pools because they are too costly for local authorities. It asked me to introduce a scheme and I provided €14 million to assist with energy costs for existing pools. A number of local authority pools throughout the country were in serious difficulty and unable to keep their doors open. Without the scheme there were would more closures. The problem is that the pool in Maynooth is private. Deputy Durkan asked me to meet local representatives and I will do so, but I will not meet those involved with private pools. I have been under pressure from Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues and others over the past number of months and I am trying to open a limited scheme. I do not want members in every local authority asking for a scheme when local authorities have no will or funding for such a scheme.  Two or three areas in the country are in need of pools and I am considering how we can introduce a scheme. Pools will be provided in areas where demand exists and feasibility studies will be done to ensure they will be profitable. There is no point in setting up pools that will be in difficulty six months after they have opened. The Deputies have a point and I am examining the issue. I gave a commitment and asked my officials some months ago to develop a scheme whereby we can deal with two or three areas in the country and give them the opportunity to have a pool.

Its current funding allocation of €324 million covers the period from 2013 to 2015. New legislation will be introduced at the end of 2015 to provide the commission with its funding for the next three-year cycle, 2016 to 2018. The commission is required under section 13 of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts to prepare and publish an annual statement of Estimates. The statement of Estimates before the Dáil for noting today is in respect of the estimated expenditure covering the period beginning on 1 January 2016 and ending on 31 December 2016.  It was normal in the past for this Estimates process to be undertaken in October of each year, but due to the fact that since 2013 the budget has been brought forward from December to October under the new European semester, it is now necessary for the commission to have the statement of Estimates noted by the Dáil before the House goes into recess in July. This is because, under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, the statement of Estimates of the commission must be furnished by the Secretary General to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform not later than 30 days before the presentation by the Minister to Dáil Éireann of the Estimates of the receipts and expenditure of that year.  Deputies will be aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Appointments to Certain Offices) Bill 2014, which is currently before the House, will allow for changes in this regard. It will delete the 30-day provision to allow time for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service to submit Estimates much closer to the budget, having had the opportunity to finalise figures in the September-October period, which will enable it to have a much more accurate assessment of expenditure trends before it has to submit a scheme of expenditure to the House for noting. The Estimate amount required by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for 2016 is €130.99 million. This is €18.7 million, or 16.6%, higher than the 2015 Estimate. The main reason for the 16% increase is the need to cover costs arising from the Dáil and Seanad elections which must take place by early next year. Election costs of €14.3 million have been included in the Estimate. When the election costs are removed, the underlying increase over the 2015 Estimate is €4.3 million, or 4%. This can be attributed to, among other things, an increase in the ICT project budget to account for a new parliamentary questions system, with which Deputies will be familiar, a new website, and new technologies in the Chamber, as well as an increased allocation for legal services and increased security measures. I commend this motion to the House.

I wish to raise several particular issues. It will be popular to slag off politicians today, as people think there are votes to be got by running down the national Parliament. I for one do not ever believe the remarks of people in the Parliament who say they live on the minimum wage gross before tax. Their standard of living does not justify these remarks. They will say it, and some of their supporters will believe it, and it is a mantra. Perhaps it is a little politically unpopular to say it, but I love giving facts now and again, and I looked at the total cost for next year of salaries for Members of Dáil Éireann, Chairmen of committees, travel and accommodation allowances for Deputies, the public representation allowance for Deputies and other allowances for Deputies and the same for Members of the Seanad, and out of the €131 million this comes to €30 million, which is 23% of the cost of the Oireachtas. Some people will have it that it costs €131 million to run the Oireachtas, when in fact only 23% of this goes to Deputies and Senators, and this includes running constituency offices and everything involved in it. It is quite a low proportion. Even if I add in the cost of the pensions of former Members it brings it up to approximately one third of the overall budget. The figure also includes salaries in respect of Members of the European Parliament. Payments to Deputies and politicians and the costs of running their constituencies and constituency offices represent approximately 25% of what we are speaking about. Some people would like to think it is an enormous figure, but 25% in respect of the Members with regard to running the overall business of the Oireachtas is not too severe. I wish to refer to a number of specific issues. There is to be a massive increase in consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews next year, from €800,000 to €2.5 million. I would love to know why. The termination allowances in respect of former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas is planned to be €3.388 million.

I would love to see more detail on the costs of the banking inquiry. I know it is not possible to achieve it in this short time. I would like to see more details on the cost of the parliamentary legal advisory service and I will write directly to the Ceann Comhairle on this matter. As a Deputy I am not happy with how the system works. The Ceann Comhairle can obtain legal advice from the service on discussing motions in the Chamber, and he will allow a debate depending on the legal advice. Various committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts and the banking inquiry are smothered with legal advice and are told what they can and cannot do, but when Members come here to vote in the Chamber on a Bill with possible constitutional implications no legal advice is available. Members of the Government have the advice of the Attorney General, but Members of the Parliament casting their votes are unable to receive individual legal advice. This service needs to be available to all Members and not just to the Ceann Comhairle and select committees.

Ní raibh mé ag iarraidh díospóireachta chun gearán a dhéanamh, ach chun a mheabhrú do dhaoine nach bhfuil gach uile pháirtí ar Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais. The minutes of the commission are available online, but this does not take away from the fact quite a portion of Deputies are not represented on it, which means one is not represented in the day to day running of the House. This is a criticism I have repeated since the commission was established. We should try as much as possible, without making it unwieldy, for the commission to be fully reflective, so all of the parties in the House, and that includes staff, play a role in ensuring the services the Houses of the Oireachtas give us day in day out are the best possible services. We are in a different era to 50 years ago. Much more is expected of us as parliamentarians than would have been expected even ten years ago. The access the public now has to Deputies and Senators is much faster and much more demanding than when I was first elected in 2002. When I was first elected the majority of my correspondence was through letters and now it is through e-mail. E-mail, and social media in particular, demand much quicker responses. They also demand us to be much more transparent and open in our activities. We are a window into the Irish Parliament for the world. This includes Ireland and elsewhere. When I go back to my office I might have a text message or an e-mail from an Irish citizen in some far-flung part of the world who might pass comment, as people often do. It might not be about me, it might be that the Dáil looked very grubby today. It can be this mundane. People look in and expect us as a Parliament to carry out our work as parliamentarians but also expect us to have the facilities. There is a cost involved and there are people, in particular sometimes the media, who can be overly critical of the cost of democracy. They do not know it sometimes, but it does cost. We have a figure for an Estimate, part of which I presume will include, or if not will definitely include next year, the cost of securing the building. We were told almost ten years ago that in the morning this building could fall down around us. I do not think the general public internationally would want it to fall down, unless some of us were in it perhaps, as that is the way some people look at it. There is a cost involved. It is an old building and it will cost money to fix it to ensure we carry out the work people sent us here to do in the first place. People need to remember they sent us here. They have a choice every number of years to send us back. It is a useful mechanism that once a year the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission puts forward its annual budget and that it gets a cursory debate at the very least because it is a big sum of money. People need to remember it covers the cost of more than 400 staff and 226 Deputies and Senators, and the running of an old building which is inefficient and everything else that goes with it. I congratulate the work everybody has done in recent times to cut costs such as electricity. We need to spend more on modernising our facilities to ensure we can capture the new world out there through social media. This is not a criticism of the Houses of the Oireachtas PR team which does a lot. We all do much but we can do a lot more. I am not opposed to the budget. It reflects where we are today. Last year's annual accounts showed we underspent what was allocated, which in some way sets the agenda. We need modernised facilities, so if something is starting to creak at the seams we need to fix it.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	233	I will pick up on one of the points made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh regarding the make-up of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. It is a significant issue, as the body is made up of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil, with Sinn Féin, the Technical Group and other Independents excluded. There may be a different set of priorities as a result. For example, in considering the Oireachtas committees, I believe there is a need to beef up the secretariat so it could do more meaningful work. That is an example of how there is not really an opportunity for us to make any kind of input into the process. The Minister might recall the issue I have continuously raised regarding the Technical Group and the changing nature of its mandate. If opinion polls are to be believed, although we do not know, there could be a very different make-up to the Dáil next time but what has happened does not reflect that. I spent a long time going back and forth to the Minister's office trying to achieve some changes to a particular piece of legislation so a group recognised in Standing Orders, the Technical Group, could get a small number of staff resources to run the group. For example, the group is comparable in size to Fianna Fáil in the Dáil, which has in the order of 20 staff provided for the running of parliamentary activities. The Technical Group does not get anyone. The Minister was quite helpful to me in writing a letter with which I went to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. That stated it was entirely within the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to change or revise the regulations currently in place, within budgetary constraints placed upon it. It indicated that although the Technical Group is not a party and, therefore, cannot be allocated resources as if it was, the commission may, if it sees fit, make new regulations to allow for the specific provision of additional facilities to individual members or parties to comprise the Technical Group. With a group of 17 or 18 Members, some managing is required, even to organise somebody to answer the phone or e-mails and ensure that people are allocated to committees, etc. This cannot be done otherwise. The Technical Group made an arrangement in which it became the private employer of two people, so this could be achieved. However, this should have been unnecessary as such a resource should have been provided. It will not be provided within this Dáil. It is absolutely wrong that a different approach is taken because of the mandate despite the fact that the citizen is sovereign and has the choice in sending people to this House. It is absolutely outrageous that the Technical Group can be so underprovided for. The Minister's helpful letter was sent to me on 1 April 2014 and I felt I was made a fool of in the run-around I got on this issue. The feedback from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which required much effort to get, was that the only way in which we could be provided with resources was if I, as the Technical Group Whip, was disabled. That is the kind of nonsensical approach that must be changed if we are to respect the mandate and its make-up now and in future. I do not have a great deal of insight into how the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission works or where its priorities lie. Two thirds of the Opposition do not have input into it, which is a glaring democratic gap, given how essential are the facilities. It may well be that if there were contrarian views on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the money or resources would be allocated in an entirely different way. For example, there might be a much more powerful committee system if there were resources to do something that is now impossible because of the generous but limited resources available.

We have come a long way from when the water charges were first mooted to be introduced by this Government, when there were many threats and much bullying talk, which was summed up when the former Minister, Commissioner Hogan, threatened to reduce water to a trickle for anybody who could not or would not pay the water charges. The Government's strident and confident approach to trying to introduce these regressive and unfair charges has disappeared in the face of a mass popular movement that has brought unprecedented numbers of people out on the streets and forced the Government into a series of humiliating U-turns on charges. The threat to turn off people's water or reduce it to a trickle was disgraceful for anybody to even consider when we are talking about a basic human right and something that people need to exist. That threat was taken off the table and the amount of the charge was reduced, with a cap introduced for the charges in order to essentially appease the popular rebellion taking place on the streets as the Government backtracked. This Bill, along with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 that we dealt with a week ago - in essence, a new Bill shoehorned into an older Bill at the last minute - are a further admission that this Government is just terrified of the massive movement against water charges. It is so terrified that it has had to hide anything to do with those water charges inside an apparently innocuous Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014. It meant that Bill, along with the legislation now being discussed, could be put into the last couple of weeks of the Dáil term so as to avoid creating any focus for the anti-water charges movement to mobilise on yet again. I am absolutely sure the Government was aware that there was a plan to have demonstrations when this legislation appeared and it did its best to try to minimise the time we would have to mobilise significant numbers. Hence, the effort to smuggle some matters to do with water charges into the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 at the last minute and ram this Bill through in the last couple of weeks.The public needs to recognise its own power and the fact that the Government is quaking in its boots in the face of the sort of mobilisations we have seen over the last year or so. The fact that Irish Water will not give out the figures on how many people have paid or not paid speaks for itself. It indicates that there is an unprecedented mass action of peaceful civil disobedience going on across the country. Regardless of the attempts by this Government to manipulate the Dáil timetable, to play fast and loose with the whole legislative process, and to spin and propagandise about the power it has or intends to give itself to deal with that boycott, the reality is that, just as the people of Greece had the courage to say "No" when faced with the bullying and threats of the troika and Angela Merkel, hundreds of thousands have the courage to say "No" to this Government's attempt to impose a totally regressive and unfair austerity tax, and they are clearly doing so in droves by refusing to pay these water bills. Against that background, what we have in this legislation is an attempt to make people think the Government has powers that it does not have to undermine that boycott. That is what this legislation is all about. Again, it is smuggled in in an apparently progressive move. One aspect of this is progressive, namely, the removal of the threat of imprisonment for people who are unable to pay small debts. That is a progressive measure, although the add-on of attachment orders, under which employers would be asked to make deductions from people's earnings, is an absolute disgrace. Employers would effectively be given a political profile of their employees. If they are, as hundreds of thousands are, engaged in an act of political protest by refusing to pay water charges, their employers will be given that information by the courts, with all the potential ramifications that could have for individuals. It also applies in the case of bills that people might simply have been unable to pay because they are poor, because they are low-paid, because they are on zero-hour or low-hour contracts, or for whatever reason. The Government is proposing to give people's employers the information that they have been unable to pay debts and have had court orders made against them to the effect that their employers are to deduct those unpaid debts. That is a pretty disgraceful move. This is another in a very long litany of utterly treacherous things for the Labour Party to do. For the Labour Party to give an employer that kind of information, detail and power over an employee is nauseating. However, we should not be surprised by a further betrayal by the Labour Party, which has given up even any slight pretence of being a progressive, left-wing party with the things it has done and the betrayals it has perpetrated over the last few years. That is a disgraceful element of this legislation, but the key characteristic of the legislation is that the Government is trying to kick the whole thing down the road. It is trying to shoehorn this Bill into a short period of time, misrepresent what is actually in it, and then kick the substantial issue of how to deal with a mass boycott down the line until after a general election. This is an act of political cowardice of the highest order. What I want to say to the many people who are opposed to water charges and who have been on the protests is that it proves how powerful this movement is. People need to understand that this sort of power, which can make the Government run, hide, kick cans down the road, manipulate, spin and mess around with the legislative process, shows that people are winning and that if they maintain the boycott and the massive mobilisations on the streets over the coming months, these water charges can be defeated and the Government that introduced them can be swept out of office.

The Government has argued that the Bill is commendable and came about as a result of recommendations from the Law Reform Commission. At least one section of the Bill is to be welcomed by all Members of the House - namely, the abolition of imprisonment for non-payment of debt. This puts an end to the shameful situation whereby a person could be taken to court and then imprisoned for not paying for a television licence. Maybe, with an election coming up, the Government has grown a conscience. Maybe it has simply woken up to the sad fact that the prison services cannot cope with the number of people imprisoned for non-payment of fines. This Bill is not about civil debt at all. It is about Irish Water. Faced with massive non-payment and non-registration for Irish Water, the Government is running scared. The people are winning. In response, the Government is scaremongering by suggesting people will be taken to court for non-payment of water charges. It is trying to bully and scare people into paying for water, which they already do in the form of general taxation. People will not be fooled into paying for their water twice. The Minister will say this Bill is not about Irish Water, but that is exactly what it is about. The Government is trying to punish those people who cannot afford to pay another bill. It is not interested in giving people options. It wants to leave people with no choice but to capitulate. Yet again, the Government seriously underestimates the will of the Irish people and the strength of the non-payment campaign. Irish Water is in fact already dead in the water and this Bill is just another desperate attempt by the Government to buoy it up by ramming this legislation through before the summer recess. It is initiating debates on non-regular sitting days, changing the names of Bills, changing sections at the last minute, and guillotining real and frank debate on these issues. One of the major reforms we were to see when this Government came to power was that the guillotine would not be used or would only be used very sparingly. In fact, it has been used more often during this Dáil than during the previous one. That shows the Government's disregard for the democratic process and its arrogance in the face of large-scale opposition to water charges. It can be seen in this Bill. Rather than go after the real architects of the recession in our country, it is going after the little people - the soft targets - and it is going after them for the shirt off their backs. The big debtors to the Irish economy were given write-downs and debt forgiveness worth billions, while ordinary people can now be taken to court for a debt of as little as €500.With the Civil Debt Bill 2015, the Government has once again pinned its colours to the mast and sided with huge utility companies and multinational corporations rather than with the ordinary people. They have chosen to enact this legislation to help creditors rather than debtors. The hypocrisy of this Government has to be seen to be believed. As has been the case with nearly everything else the Government has done, this Bill will have an impact on those who are already vulnerable, such as women, those on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare. This, of course, should come as no surprise, considering the Government's track record in this regard, which seemed particularly evident last week with the cruel and regressive cuts to the lone parent allowance and the utter disdain for those on low incomes voiced by one of the Government Deputies last week, which was so base that I will not attempt to repeat it. Those people who struggle to survive on a daily basis are the most vulnerable to falling into debt. A cycle of constant indebtedness is a real possibility when, in paying off one debt, a person falls into another, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty that represses ordinary people in this country. In case the Government needs any reminder in this regard, this week the Living Wage Technical Group published the findings of its research, which showed that people in Ireland need to earn €450 a week to be able to afford an acceptable standard of living. This equates to an hourly rate of €11.50, which means a living wage is one third higher than the minimum wage, which is set at €8.65 an hour for an adult. There are many thousands of Irish citizens who do not earn a living wage and are living on well below €450 a week. They are the ones who are being targeted by the Government while the bankers and their friends get off scot free. A seemingly welcome aspect of the Bill is that it makes it clear that water charges cannot be deducted at source; they cannot be taken directly from people's incomes and social welfare. Instead, the Bill provides that each case must be heard in court before an attachment order can be granted. That means that each and every case involving a person who is taking part in the massive campaign to boycott water charges must be heard in court, something that simply cannot be done. All of their finances must be looked at and they can appeal the ruling. Of course, they cannot be taken to court for at least two years on the basis of the €500. Those who are indebted to the tune of only €500 are hardly likely to be able to pay for legal representation. How are the vulnerable to be represented in the courts? Will they be dependent on free legal aid and will they get it? This Bill, if enacted, will be completely unworkable. The Bill allows creditors, including Irish Water, to apply to the court for an order enabling an attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments for the purpose of the enforcement of debt of as little as €500. This will disproportionately target those on low pay and persons in receipt of social welfare payments. There is no requirement in the legislation that a creditor must first exhaust other avenues before resorting to taking a person to court. In this regard, I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Pringle, when he stated last Friday:People must be afforded an opportunity to enter into a payment plan to allow them to reduce their debt without having to go before the courts. On attachment orders for people in receipt of social welfare payments, the Bill is unclear about the level at which attachment orders may be made against social welfare payments. ... Without ... a threshold, the courts may place people in even greater financial difficulty by allowing attachment orders to be made which would reduce a social welfare payment to an amount below the level required to survive.Any reasonable and responsible creditor will help a person pay his or her debt by way of delaying the repayment, freezing interest rates or accepting payment by instalments. The legislation before the House today does not impose on creditors any obligation to offer debtors a payment plan or require them to enter into payment with a debtor before seeking to secure a payment order for the debt in court. The creditor can immediately opt to take a person to court. This, of course, is reckless. The Bill completely ignores this. I believe this Bill is unworkable, will not be successful if it is implemented, and will ensure that there is increased opposition to these unjust and unfair water charges, which represent more austerity for ordinary people.

Sometimes one has to stand back to see the wood for the trees. One has to cut through a lot of the hyperbole, the rhetoric, the inflammatory language and the images that are put before the House, such as what I have heard in the past ten or fifteen minutes, and look at the reality behind the introduction of this Bill. It appeared as a recommendation from the Free Legal Advice Centres, as far back as 2009, in its report entitled To No One's Credit. It was recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2010. It appeared in my party's manifesto before the 2011 general election, at which we were elected as the largest party. It subsequently appeared in the programme for Government in 2011. If there is a criticism, it should be that it has taken this long to bring it before the House in 2015. As a matter of fact, a predecessor of mine from Cork South-West, the former Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, when spokesperson for justice, introduced a Private Members' Bill advocating more or less exactly what is in the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill. Therefore, it has been knocking around for some time on the recommendation of some very respected bodies. It will be opposed, despite the fact that last year alone we committed almost 9,000 people to prison for non-payment of fines or civil debts. We can continue to imprison people. We can continue to incarcerate them and take away their liberty for something as trivial as non-payment of a fine or, in the case of part of this Bill, non-payment of a debt, but there is something fundamentally wrong with this. There is something fundamentally unfair about denying people their liberty, in many cases giving them terms of several months in prison despite the fact that that is not what they will serve. In almost all cases, they will be out within hours or, in worse cases, days. The fact that they have been imprisoned remains, and goes against their name and on their records. It works against them in their communities. The option of an attachment order on earnings - or, indeed, where possible, on social welfare payments, although this would be minimal - has been proposed by many different agencies and organisations for a number of years. I also welcomed the previous legislation that we enacted. I believe it will have a chilling effect on those who deliberately decide to avail of a service or deal in goods from a business or agency and not pay for it, despite the fact that it is clearly illegal and a breach of contract. It is fine if people want to oppose the Bill and say they support that, but we as public representatives have a strong responsibility to say we uphold the law that is passed in this Chamber, particularly when that law has been put before the people as part of a manifesto and included in a programme for Government.We cannot call ourselves democrats only to be à
la carte democrats and say that this is the part of democracy we like but that is the part we can do without because it does not support our agenda, or that we can shoehorn it into a different forum. One can call it street protest or whatever one likes, but advocating it is irresponsible and does no justice to anyone elected to the House who claims to be democratic. It does not matter whether people believe in democratic objectives for Ireland, or any other country to which they travel advocating for democracy, justice and civil rights and claiming to have a mandate. We have a mandate for this. We agreed it, but, lo and behold, when we have before us a very sensible and pragmatic proposal to allow for the smooth running of business the length and breadth of the country, those who advocate most in this House for democratic principles, justice, equality and fairness oppose the Bill and talk about hypocrisy in the same breath. They need to reflect on what they have said, what we have proposed and what we said before the general election, and then consider what "hypocrisy" really means. Do we want to bring people from all over the country to Mountjoy to be incarcerated for a couple of hours before giving them their fares back to wherever they come from, be it west Cork, Donegal or any other community, when we can instead tell them that if they do not live up to their contractual obligations, the matter will be brought before a judge, who will make an order that they be penalised financially? People have been calling for this for years.

It is obvious that this is a desperate attempt to follow on from the undemocratic process with which the Government rammed through the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week, all in the hope that outstanding issues relating to the water charges disaster would be tied up before the summer recess and would not need to be debated in the autumn before a possible election. People can see right through this. They see what the Government is trying to do and will remember this come election time. The fight against the Government's unjust water taxes is far from over. Those in the Government will not sweep the matter under the carpet, because the people, and those of us in the House who stand up for them, will not let them. Claims to the effect that the Bill has come from the Law Reform Commission, that it does not apply to debts to moneylenders, that it is a necessary step to solve a civil debt problem, that the courts have safeguards in place to afford protection, and the great line that it differentiates between those who cannot pay and those who will not, are spin to avoid admitting the Bill's real purpose. I have yet to see how the Bill differentiates in any meaningful way between those who cannot pay and those who will not. The Government's spin does not address any of the real concerns. I draw the Minister of State's attention to quotes from the speech of the Minister for Justice and Equality at the launch of the report of the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, yesterday. She stated:Many, many people obviously want to pay their debts, and those who can pay them will pay them. No reasonable person will resent seeing someone who has fallen on hard times benefit from proportionate debt forgiveness.The hypocrisy is unbelievable. The Government is in favour of debt forgiveness by legislating for a mechanism to take unpaid debt directly from a person's wages or social welfare. How does this work? The Bill is an obvious attempt to target those on low pay or social welfare. We are discussing sums that are relatively small for those in the higher echelons of society. For ordinary people, though, debts of this level have a serious impact on their lives. These are the people who will be targeted disproportionately. The Government is afraid that its Irish Water plans are coming apart at the seams. The truth is that they are. The Bill is intimidation on the Government's part. It is an underhanded attempt to transform the Government's fear about Irish Water into the people's fear that they may be dragged before the courts for their accumulated debts. People are not naive; they can see through this. What the Bill deals with is legislatively unnecessary and avoidable, or at least, it was until the Government needed such a mechanism in order to prop up the power of its own creditor, Irish Water. Let me be clear: Irish Water must be abolished, and there should be no need for recovery of unpaid charges at all. Regarding other creditors, Sinn Féin opposes the Bill because it does not require creditors to consider whether there is a more appropriate way to deal with disputes before rushing to the courts, further clogging the system, to get legal orders against persons in debt. Civil debt is a serious strain on anyone. The Bill seeks to punish those who fall into this trap, mostly those on low wages or social welfare who are already living on the poverty line, by giving creditors the option to drag them before a judge without any need to try to solve the dispute through a less adversarial method. Sinn Féin has submitted amendments to the Bill for consideration on Committee Stage. They are simple. Of the 27 sections, only one is of merit. Section 26 repeals Parts I and IV of the Debtors Act (Ireland) 1872. It is the only section that we support. I wish to address some of the bizarre comments made by Deputy Catherine Byrne on Friday. She must have seen some of the media coverage over the weekend and realised the stupidity of her comments and just how far removed she is from the majority of citizens in the State. It must be difficult for her stretching her budget in such a way. After all, one could hardly fill a shopping basket on a basic salary of €87,000 per year. Deputy Catherine Byrne, in referencing this Bill, stated that people had a civic responsibility to pay debts, including debts relating to water charges. I am happy that she acknowledged this, but how does an increase in the pensions of former Taoisigh and Ministers contribute to their civic responsibility? How does a ministerial pay increase contribute? I am sure the Deputy will be delighted that she, too, can now afford a little luxury by way of a bottle of wine at the weekend, with a salary increase on the cards for Deputies as well. It is insulting to suggest that the low-paid and those on welfare, whom this Bill targets, have not paid their way. Do Government Deputies even bother to read their e-mails or talk to people in their constituencies? In case Deputy Catherine Byrne is oblivious to how her voting record in this Dáil has forced those on low pay or welfare to contribute to their civic responsibility more than any other sector of society, here are some statistics to help her understand. They were compiled by Dr. Rory Hearne and published at the weekend. The eight austerity budgets between 2008 and 2014 involved €18.5 billion in cuts to public spending. Public service staff numbers have been reduced by 37,500, or 10%. The health budget has seen a 27% cut, with an 81% increase in the number of patients on trolleys in hospital waiting rooms. Funding for local authority housing was cut from €1.3 billion in 2007 to just €83 million in 2013. There were cuts to lone parent payments, which happened last week, as well as to child benefit and fuel allowance, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, rent supplement, and disability and carer's allowances. There have been extra charges for households, including water, property, school transport, prescription and third level fees, on top of an increase in living costs.There has been a 50% cut to community, youth and rural development schemes. The obvious result has been hundreds of thousands of families pushed into poverty. Food poverty in Ireland affects 600,000 people. Are these the people that Deputy Byrne believes are filling their trolleys with drink? I hope the Deputy realises how much hurt her comments have caused to hundreds of thousands of struggling people who have more than paid off their civic responsibility. This Bill aims to bleed such people dry for the benefit of Irish Water in cases where there may be some unpaid debt. The points raised by Deputy Byrne raise serious questions about the mindset of this Government. I suggest that her insulting remarks expose a deeper problem, which is the Government's belief that it has the power to dictate to people in this State how they should live their lives and what they can and cannot afford. This is indicative of the Government's mindset on the very purpose of this Bill. The Government appears to believe it is acceptable to draft legislation to dictate to people how much money should be deducted from their hard-earned wages and how that money should be spent. This is not how democracy works. It is certainly not the right way for the Government to deal with its water charge failures. Sinn Féin will submit amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage. We will not support the Bill as it is. It must be amended to delete all sections which advocate a flawed approach to the recovery of debt. An adversarial approach is not the way forward. The only section of merit in the entire Bill is that providing for the abolition of the imprisonment of debtors, which is a sensible proposal. The rest of the Bill misses the bigger picture. It is unnecessary and ruthless to allow companies, including Irish Water, to use bully tactics to recover debt in this way. It is not the direction that legal resolutions are heading in. For the most part, the courts are heading down a path of mediation and dispute resolution. To allow creditors to use the courts as a first option, as this Bill does, undermines the direction the courts are taking. It is not an acceptable way for the Government to deal with the problem it will face in trying to enforce the unjust and unfair water tax that has been imposed on our people.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	246	This Bill serves as further proof of the Government's tendency to legislate in favour of the well-off and against the interests of citizens. Under the Haddington Road agreement, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and this Government have agreed that former Ministers and taoisigh will get significant increases in their five-figure and six-figure pensions, which are already substantial. Citizens are understandably outraged. Léargas eile is ea é seo ar an gcaoi ina bhfuil dlí amháin ann do dhaoine saibhre agus dlí eile do dhaoine eile. This Government has imposed four years of austerity. Citizens face a range of new bills for water charges, property taxes and septic tank charges. VAT bills have increased and there has been a general increase in consumption taxes. There has also been forced emigration. This Government has deliberately planned for a low wage economy. It is responsible for the worst trolley figures in our hospitals for more than 12 years, with 333 citizens on trolleys across the State today, including 35 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is in my constituency. There has been a general rundown in public services. The number of children living in poverty has doubled. It is estimated that 12,000 lone parent families, including many in my constituency, are facing significant cuts of up to €86 per week as a result of a decision taken by Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies last week. We learned yesterday that Dublin City Council is facing an €18.5 million shortfall as it seeks to tackle the growing homeless problem in the city and will run out of money in October. Some 67 families were made homeless in Dublin in May. A further 65 families were made homeless in June. Ciallaíonn na staitisticí seo go bhfuil breis is 1,000 páiste gan dídean. The Government is adding to its litany of bad decisions and misery today by guillotining the debate on the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill 2015 in this House. This regressive legislation targets the low-paid by enabling applications to be made for attachment orders that will allow money to be taken out of wages, welfare payments and pensions to pay for water charges, credit debts and other utility bills. When the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, joined the Labour Party in his first flush of idealism, thereby signing up to the great historic party of James Connolly, I wonder whether he thought he would be sitting in this Chamber to shepherd through such a Bill. This is a reactionary Government's reactionary response to the popular outrage at the imposition of water charges. No similar legislation has been introduced in response to corruption, white-collar crime or the despicable behaviour of the insiders in the golden circle, about which we hear every day. As a result of this Bill, families struggling to make ends meet will have their incomes reduced further. This law and the stigma attached to it will become another hurdle for people who are seeking work. It is a bad Bill for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be tasked with implementing it. In effect, the Government is forcing employers to become debt collectors and debt payees for the State, just as it did with landlords. It is also forcing them to become involved with the courts. This legislation will empower the courts to make an order directing an employer to deduct certain specified amounts from the debtor's earnings and to pay the sums deducted in the manner specified to the creditor. Some 70% of workers outside the public sector are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now facing an additional bureaucratic and expensive administrative burden. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, said on Friday that the Bill "will not be directed at those who cannot pay but rather at those who can pay but choose not to", but she knows it will be used against people in debt who cannot pay. Everybody knows that. If one owes money for gas, electricity, Christmas presents, a communion dress, a washing machine or beds or other furniture, all of one's creditors will be able to take one to court and seek to have money taken from one's welfare, pensions or wages. Deputy Catherine Byrne has argued that this is an entirely appropriate way to deal with people who spend all their money on drink and cigarettes. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill 2015 is essentially another bill for desperate families and citizens to pay. I thought of concluding by saying the Labour Party should be ashamed of endorsing this Bill, but that would be a waste of time. Last week, it voted to take money from the pockets and purses of thousands of lone parents. As I said at the outset, former Ministers and taoisigh will gain more than the low-paid under the Haddington Road agreement. This means that Ministers, including those who are bringing through this Bill, will get more out of the Haddington Road agreement than low-paid workers who will have this legislation used against them.

On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this legislation. I might use the time available to me to remind the House of the main features of the Bill. It will abolish imprisonment for non-payment of debt and provide for two new District Court measures for the recovery of modest debts. These fair and balanced measures will ensure the ability of debtor to pay the debt is considered as a key element of the court process. The Bill will ensure that debtors are not subject to attachment or deduction orders which will bring their income levels below a reasonable standard. It is interesting that the contributions of many Opposition Deputies concentrated on matters which are not related to the Bill itself. Some Deputies made comments that suggest they would prefer if people broke the law rather than meeting their commitments. I remind the House that this Bill applies to a wide range of creditors and not just to Irish Water. I would need more than another minute to do justice to the script that has been prepared for me.It is a basic part of democracy to support citizens who pay their way and to make legislative options available for citizens who are owed money by giving them the legislative supports for its recovery. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill is a balanced measure which provides creditors with improved enforcement mechanisms in respect of modest debts, but also provides strong safeguards for debtors.

I propose this amendment in the same spirit. The purpose of the amendment is to extend the definition of the term "owner" to include property which is in the de facto care and control of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  One of the main objectives of the Bill is to assist in addressing the housing shortage by tackling the hoarding of property. The National Asset Management Agency is the largest property company in the world and controls massive land banks in this country by virtue of its dealings with property developers. When NAMA was established in 2009, the Department of Finance projected that 30,000 new houses would be required annually in the medium term. Considering the reach of the agency and given its control of a large number of development sites as a result of acquiring the assets of developers, it is reasonable to expect it to play a key role in delivering this housing. Regrettably, however, NAMA has failed in this regard.  The National Asset Management Agency blows its own trumpet because it has a target of completing 4,500 new housing units in Dublin by 2016 and 20,000 housing units in the greater Dublin area in the next five years. These figures will be only a drop in the ocean given the extent of the housing shortage and house building requirements. Given its control of many development sites, NAMA should have played a significant role in addressing the housing shortage by funding and working with developers to this end. Its failure to do so is a key reason for the housing shortage. If the agency had done what it should have been doing, we would have more houses.  A large of amount of land is being hoarded and remains undeveloped. NAMA is not working with developers, many of whom will tell stories about the difficulties they have experienced in dealing with the agency. Many matters of concern have been aired in public without any answers being provided by NAMA. Mr. Justice Cregan, for example, seriously chastised NAMA in the High Court on the basis of its dealings with the developer, Mr. John Flynn, while the portfolio of another developer, Mr. Michael O'Flynn, was not sold to the highest bidder. The objective of the amendment is to bring some accountability in respect to the National Asset Management Agency by ensuring it is not above the law that applies to ordinary private property owners who may find themselves obliged to pay a vacant site levy.In view of that, I ask the Minister of State to give the matter serious consideration. I understand that the definition of "owner" is the ordinary one, but the position for these developers and property owners is that NAMA has all the say in relation to what happens to their properties. As such, NAMA should be brought in as part of the solution to address our housing shortage.

This would create extra cost. We are adding an extra cost on in terms of NAMA and the properties that are there, in particular when it comes to the levies. As such, I do not see the purpose of the amendment and will oppose it.

While she does not say so explicitly, it is an implicit and severe indictment of the Government because it has allowed NAMA to behave in the way it has. Many of us on this side of the House have been saying since we arrived here and the Government took office that NAMA should have been transferring much more land and property directly to local authorities to provide social housing. The Government simply did not listen. We have got a derisory social dividend from NAMA and that failure is one of the major contributory factors to the catastrophic social housing crisis we face. The problem is that the horse has, to a very large extent, bolted and a levy does not really deal with it. What should happen is a simple change of NAMA's entire mandate or to have all available housing and land that could be used for social housing immediately transferred to local authorities. Any cash that NAMA generates should provide the capital for a major social housing construction programme instead of being used to pay off bonds. While a lot of the money has been used to redeem its bonds, at one stage when NAMA appeared before a committee, it had €4 billion in cash reserves. That money could have financed a serious social housing programme. Recently, its cash reserves have been reduced considerably because NAMA has used the money to redeem bonds. We could have put billions of euro into a social housing programme but did not. I do not know the latest position but maybe the Minister of State can enlighten the House. Do we have an estimate of how much more cash NAMA will generate from the off-loading of land and properties before it is due to dissolve itself? What are we doing with that money? Why do we not say now that the money will be used as the capital for a serious emergency programme of direct social housing provision? A levy will just not cut it at this stage. It will not make any difference. The big question is the mandate the Government gives NAMA. That mandate should change so that NAMA is not there simply to unload big lots of land or property to whoever it can sell to just for money. The whole mandate should be geared around the provision of social housing and resolving the housing crisis. If its mandate is not changed in those terms, NAMA should be dissolved and everything it has simply given to local authorities. As we will discuss in more detail later, even if we did that, the Government would still have to provide the money for a serious social housing programme. Despite all of the spin and propaganda of the Government about the billions of euro to be applied before 2017 and 2020, one finds when one looks at the detail of the Government's social housing strategy 2020 that there will be no big social housing building programme. Approximately 85% to 90% of what the Government is doing is outsourcing to the private sector. Given the scale of the crisis, that means the stealth privatisation of social housing will be the long-term effect of the Government's policy, including in the legislation before the House. It is to Deputy Mulherin's credit that she points to the issue of NAMA and what it has not been doing and should be doing, but this particular amendment will simply not deal with the problem. The problem is one of Government policy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	254	I also commend Deputy Mulherin, which is not something that happens too often, for raising the serious underperformance of NAMA. Aside from what seem to be a lot of spurious deals where it appears the taxpayer could have fared a great deal better, NAMA is actually boasting that it will make approximately €1 billion in profit over the six to eight-year period. That still leaves the taxpayer about €40 billion short. Given that the market has been rising for a while, it is outrageous that more was not realised. The point the Deputy made about the social dividend and NAMA's failure to provide it is a frightening one. What is really uncomfortable is the fact that we have a serious level of inconsistency in how NAMA has done its business. Sometimes it applies its rules rigidly and sometimes it does not. A simple example is that of the Dublin GAA trying to get hold of the Spawell but failing to do so. It beggars belief that a sporting organisation in Ireland would not have been facilitated and given a little bit of an extra chance. It is not like the GAA was going to make money on it. It intended to provide a social outlet for young people and should have been helped by NAMA. NAMA will argue that it is under an obligation to maximise the potential of the asset for the taxpayer. When it makes that argument, I would like NAMA to explain its approach when a bidder went to buy not the loans but the debt of the Chicago Spire, which was at $78 million plus costs which brought it to approximately $93 million. An investor sought to buy the debt, and this was every penny that was owed to the bank. This was not the reduced value, but the par value.In other words, this investor was prepared to pay the debt in full but NAMA gave it to Jones Lang LaSalle in New York to sell. This was a site in Chicago. Even if NAMA thought it could get more for it, it was not in New York that it would have got it. It would have been interesting if it had marketed it in Chicago. Why could NAMA not accept the debt being bought out? It is estimated that it was sold for $35 million. NAMA refused $78 million, plus the cost, and it accepted a figure in the region of €35 million. That was claimed to be in the interests of the taxpayer in the same way as NAMA not accepting the bid from Dublin GAA for the Spawell because it claimed it was maximising the potential of the asset. It is horrendous that NAMA could not deliver housing units for Dublin, in particular where there is such a serious housing crisis. It beggars belief. The argument was spun that certain property was not really suitable. The funny thing about that is that NAMA did not want to give much of the property that was suitable to the State because it was attractive to investors. What has happened is that vulture funds, mostly from the US, were allowed to cherry pick the best of it because NAMA sought to sell the best of it to them. It then considered some of the other property, which was not quite as attractive to the vulture funds, for social or affordable housing. NAMA is a State body over which governments - this one and the previous one - do not seem to have much control. Issues are raised about it. The idea that the Comptroller and Auditor General has it all in hand beggars belief. I have seen too many things which I do not believe the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen, and I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is honest. It would be an incredible challenge for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the few people working with him to keep tabs on everything that is happening within NAMA. It would be a massive challenge, and it is not only about auditing. Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have expertise in the area of markets, construction and the future potential of assets? Does he have all those people working for him in order to be able to test the waters and ensure NAMA is doing what is best for the taxpayer at every turn? It is asking way to much of the Comptroller and Auditor General to think that he could come up with all those answers. He would be an amazing man, irrespective of how many people he had working with him. Sadly, there is now the idea that the Committee of Public Accounts can examine this, behind which the Government can hide, as if it is an Oireachtas investigation and the committee will see if everything is all right. That is not what will happen. If those in government want to know the truth and if they really want to know if the taxpayer was best served in these deals, they will eventually have to initiate an independent inquiry into the workings of NAMA. It is extremely important because not only are we dealing with things that have happened - people must be held responsible for what they have done - but there are so many assets still to be sold. Will that be done right? At present, we do not know and given that NAMA remains a secret society, we do not have a real opportunity to see how it operates. An independent investigation might bring us that. There is a great deal of money at stake. The figures are astronomical so it is extremely important the State addresses this.  The Government should not put this off and kick the can down the road. We need an independent inquiry established right now. How it would be structured is an argument for another day. The Government will probably have to bring in some people from outside the country. I refer to many of the more senior players in the services the Government might use. There is such an incestuous nature to much of what goes on this country that the Government will probably have to bring in some external expertise.

It is as if we are in the middle of a production of "Hamlet" when the boys are outside talking about there being something very rotten in the state of Denmark. We all know what happened at the end play - there was no more Hamlet and the dynasty he stood over dissolved as well. I honestly believe we on the cusp of something similar here. Deputy Mulherin was correct in saying that NAMA has made an absolute hames out of its obligations in terms of the supposed goal that it would play a role in assisting in providing housing and so on. That is only one side of the equation because, ultimately, it is this Government and other Government policies that have contributed to this situation. The Dublin City Council housing manager had to take to the media outlets to highlight the fact that his budget for this city will be €18 million short to deal with the homeless crisis. Even today three people contacted my office. These are people living in hotels or hostels with serious mental health and physical health problems. People are being told to source accommodation themselves. If they find hotel or hostel which will take them, they are told to telephone a number and that the person at the end of that line will activate a credit card to pay for that accommodation. When people do that, they do not get an answer to the number they telephone to activate the credit card and then the hotel accommodation is often gone. The idea that we are expending millions of euro on this type of accommodation for families is appalling. It is appalling wrong way round economics when we have so many units supposedly in the ownership of the State in NAMA. Instead NAMA is being used to off-load large quantities of property in big chunks which, as Deputy Wallace and others have said, has resulted in a distortion of the rental market, contributing on that side to other housing pressures. A number of residents in my area have sought to approach NAMA as a co-operative of residents. They would be middle income earners who would be refused large mortgages for the types of prices being charged for properties but if they collectively approached NAMA for some of the units, the Sate would get more money than it is getting from some of these big vulture funds and people would be accommodated. These are extremely important issues. We are talking about billions of euros of taxpayers money potentially being wasted, ending up in the private gain of individuals.  The idea that the Government would say it is okay, there is a very transparent process there, we have a Comptroller and Auditor General and that this body is open to scrutiny is laughable because it was not open to scrutiny when those in government were on the Opposition benches. The amount of information that is now in the public domain makes it abundantly clear that given the huge interest this project is to the Irish taxpayer, and in terms of our housing strategy as we move forward, nothing short of an independent investigation is needed, involving external forensic accountants and financial people who can track down the money and find out what is going on. Something of a side show has been conducted over the past few days.I mean no disrespect to any politician but the idea that the Committee of Public Accounts would have the wherewithal to carry out this function is laughable. I wonder if this idea is being pushed as a sort of side show to divert attention from what is actually necessary, which is a real inquiry. This issue is far too important for people to try to grab a cheap headline or get themselves heard at a committee. I am sorry, but that expertise does not exist. We need something bigger. We need someone from outside our society to come in and analyse this. Given the huge property portfolios, American interests and so on, whose attention is now on this issue, that will happen sooner rather than later, but it would be far better that it would operate in the short term.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	257	On foot of the amendment proposed by Deputy Mulherin, I want to add my voice to those of other Members in placing on the record our trepidation with regard to the workings of NAMA since its inception. There is no doubt that the setting up of NAMA was not without its own controversies. There were many fears on the part of the then Opposition Members, who occupy Government benches now, as to the remit afforded to it. In the first instance, it allowed banks breathing space to get their houses in order to start again in terms of the sort of banking practices that were to be the norm from that time onwards, and more akin to what we had expected to be the norm in the first instance, despite the fact that those charged with the responsibility for their regulation assured us of that. However, we see where that has got us, together with everything else that came in 2008 and 2009. NAMA was charged with a responsibility to yield a dividend to the taxpayer. It was given certain powers and briefs, and distance from Government to allow it do that properly and effectively, but it also had to play its role in yielding a dividend from a social perspective and particularly because of the loans that were associated with property that it could play its part in addressing the deficit that was allowed develop regarding the provision of housing. Year on year since the Government came into office we questioned it on the delivery of housing units to those on that list. As we know, there are 100,000 applications for housing. That does not mean there are 100,000 applicants; it might mean there are up to 300,000 applicants. As Deputy Clare Daly said, we hear about the dilemma faced by Dublin City County Council regarding the provisions it had made on foot of commitments made by the Government regarding the homelessness problem. There are still approximately 1,000 children in emergency accommodation in Dublin. There are still 2,200 on the waiting list in the county I represent, and that is replicated throughout the country.  It is only in recent months that the Government appears to have gotten to grips with this problem and come forward with suggestions, plans and mechanisms which it believes might address that deficit but to go back to the point I was making, year on year we were told there would be a dividend from NAMA for the State but year on year, that did not materialise because, as Deputy Wallace said, we were led to believe that many of these properties were not suitable for local authorities or their tenants. There was no in-depth analysis done of the reason that might be the case and that has allowed us to express our fears that these units - multiples of them - were much more suitable for the profiteering that exists for those who come in and buy them in bulk. It is against that background, and some of the details that have come into the public domain in recent weeks, that the fears we had over the past number of years have been heightened to such an extent that one recognises and is almost forced to agree with the perception that it might take somebody of more eminence than is proposed to address, analyse and audit NAMA and allow the House to adjudicate thereafter on the effectiveness of this organisation and its ability to deliver a return to the State in the first instance, whether that be in the form of monetary profit or social dividend. I would argue there has not been a social dividend to the extent one would have expected when NAMA was set up initially. I see that in my constituency, and I hear others say they see it in their constituencies. That is at a time when there is great difficulty in terms of this Government being able to address the housing crisis and the disastrous situation that has since arisen. I have stated on numerous occasions in debates in the House on the provision of housing, whether it be questions on legislation brought before the House or at other times, that up to 40% of the representations I receive are in the area of housing provision. That is a failure on the part of all of us who were elected to work together to address the problems that arise for the constituents we represent. I am at a loss to know how to explain to the many people who come into my constituency office how they will be housed. Yesterday, I had a couple in with me from the town of Edenderry who are faced with eviction from the home they have been renting. They travelled the town in the past week or two and there is no emergency accommodation available. The stress, anxiety and exasperation in the eyes, and on the faces, of those people, who were with their children, was terrible to witness, and we are witnessing it all too often. The background music to all of that is what we heard today, during the week and, to be honest, what I have been hearing on an annual basis, is the failure of NAMA to yield a social dividend. I accept what has been said about the Dublin GAA county board, the Spawell facility and so forth, which seems to make sense in terms of the provision of an amenity to suit its needs and the needs of those people who would benefit from it. More importantly, however, is the area of addressing the housing needs and if it is proved that there has been a failure and neglect on the part of whomever to realise the reason people are in such terrible straits, then somebody has to be held accountable. What person, body, office or Department that is remains to be seen but unless a clearer picture emerges this week in regard to the deliberations of the Committee of Public Accounts on one issue in particular but, more importantly, on many others that need to be teased out, then the commitment from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the Dáil earlier will have fallen on deaf ears and he may then be forced, with his Government colleagues, to acquiesce to the request that has been made by many on this side of the House for a full independent inquiry by eminently qualified professionals who can get to the root of this problem.  Deputy Wallace talked about a figure of up to €60 million or €70 million in regard to the Chicago situation. That would house the 2,200 people needing housing in my county. That would satisfy the person who was in my office yesterday and the 40% of constituents who have sought my assistance in the office I hold and the responsibility I have been given as a Member of the Dáil in order to access the public services. When funds were available and revenue was forthcoming, we were told we were spending too much. As was stated last week in another part of the building, whom do we say is not entitled to what is available?The demand for a social dividend from NAMA to the State was made in good faith and with the best of intentions. All we want is reciprocation by those who have been given that authority. I have not seen that social dividend in the form of housing units and I would like to know why that is the case. I want a better answer than that I have been given heretofore, namely, the qualification by NAMA, or the local authority, that the units do not suit the needs. What suits the needs if many of these buildings do not? I do not know. I am at a loss to explain that.  As I said, I will reserve my judgment until we hear what is said at the committee next Thursday when those charged with oversight of taxpayers' spend question those who act on behalf of the taxpayer in relation to public funds and dividends that may be derived from their dealings. Next week, the Government will have to be in a position to say categorically that there is nothing to be fearful of here; that there is no bomb waiting to explode and that this matter is being dealt with as it should be. As I said, it might take a bit longer for explanations to be forthcoming that satisfy me and many others in relation to the failure to address the real problems that I see in my constituency in terms of the provision of housing.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	258	On the amendment, an attempt is being made to put a levy on a body that is to be wound up. I am not too sure what the benefit of that would be. While there are many questions surrounding NAMA, it is a public body. Based on what we are being told, it will be out of business soon. The real issue is not that NAMA will be sitting on vacant land but that it has not delivered social housing. At a time when there are thousands of vacant NAMA-owned houses across this State, hundreds of which are in locations where housing is needed, there are thousands of people on housing waiting lists. NAMA is not releasing houses. Any of the houses that have come on stream through NAMA are being made available on a medium-term to long-term lease basis. I am not too sure about the sustainability of that in the long term. The key issue is that assets, which are under the control of a public body, are not being used to the benefit of local authorities and people on local authority waiting lists and in need of affordable housing. It is frustrating that many loans have been sold off at a proportion of their original value. People in areas where there are NAMA properties, who would like to purchase one or two of them, cannot do so. It is an all or nothing situation, which does not assist in addressing the housing supply issue across the State, in particular at the lower end of the private market. We should be trying to assist people at that level.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, will be aware that people whose income is above €25,000 do not qualify for social housing. If they have children or a number of dependants this increases to €26,000 or €27,000. There is a huge group of people who are not eligible to purchase affordable housing and cannot afford housing on the open market. As announced yesterday, house prices across the State outside of the cities, including in the midlands and Laois and Offaly, increased by 15% in the last year. As house prices continue to increase so too does the issue of affordability. On the proposed levying of local authorities in respect of vacant sites, I believe this is counterproductive. As far as I am aware there are not that many local authority vacant sites which are causing problems. If there are any such sites they are, in the main, greenfield sites that are awaiting housing development. In my time as a public representative, I have not received too many complaints about them. Local authorities are anxious to develop sites. In levying a local authority, we would be levying not somebody on another planet but Joe public by way of increased property and PAYE taxes. A levy on local authorities would impact Joe public and not an anonymous body from outer space. The local authority is the public. The public will have to pay for any levy imposed.  There is no issue in regard to local authorities and to levy them would be to miss the target. The target is the cohort of developers and speculators who bought land and are sitting on it while it increases in value. That is the group we need to go after. We need to focus on the people who are buying sites and sitting on them for long periods. There are many such sites across different counties which are causing a problem.  Another point worth mentioning in regard to local authority vacant sites is that the public will pressurise local authorities to develop them. Local councillors, in conjunction with local communities, will pressurise local authorities to address problems around vacant sites. This morning I had to deal with a matter involving a vacant property which a local authority sought to purchase recently and on which there was a fire last week. Had the local authority been able to purchase it that might not have happened. The financial institution which owns the site does not have it registered in its name. It is almost impossible to have this matter addressed under the derelict sites legislation. The sites in respect of which problems are arising are those sites are owned by financial institutions. They are playing a cute game. Where issues arise in relation to sites owned by local authorities, one need only telephone the CEO of the council or the director of services and one will get a result. That has been my experience. If one does not get a result, councillors can hold the CEO and so on to account at the next council meeting and, under the new Act, they can hold the executive to account in regard to why an issue is not being resolved. The imposition of a levy on local authorities is a circular action in that it will be the taxpayer and ratepayer who will have to pay thereby taking from councils resources that are badly needed for other purposes. What the local authorities need is resources to build social housing on sites that are suitable for same. I know there is no silver bullet that can solve this issue straight away but, hopefully, address of this issue can be accelerated, which Sinn Féin would like to see. While every new house is welcome the pace at which social housing provision is happening is not quick enough. We would like to see greater development of sites and thus greater social housing provision. That is what is needed. In areas where there are problems with local authority sites, the public, with the help of local councillors, will apply pressure to have those problems addressed. I do not see any major issue arising in that regard. In terms of what is proposed, we are missing the target. We need to target the speculators who bought vast amounts of land during the collapse of the property market.  We have to face the reality that it will shortly be wound up. Many NAMA loans have been sold on and, as a result, there is a huge pot of money in NAMA. The Minister and the Government should give serious consideration to the use of a portion of that money for the provision of social housing, thereby releasing the pressure on local authorities in terms of the 90,000 households currently awaiting housing. I do not recall housing waiting list numbers ever being as high.The action I have proposed would also discourage people from getting involved in leasing, which only benefits developers and landlords. That approach will not provide social housing on a long-term basis, will not add to the social capital of local authorities and will not ultimately be to the public good. I ask the Minister of State to examine those two issues.

The question is how we respond to that shortage and utilise all available resources, not just those of the National Asset Management Agency but also those of local authorities, approved housing bodies and the private sector. The purpose of this Bill is to initiate changes and reforms that will incentivise the provision and supply of additional housing by addressing the issue of vacant sites. The Bill is designed to stimulate supply, especially in urban areas of high demand. We must work on a number of fronts to ensure construction on urban vacant sites gets under way as soon as possible. It is perfectly logical that where sites are serviced by existing public infrastructure, they should be brought back into beneficial use as soon as possible. Deputies have expressed concerns specifically in regard to NAMA, but many owners of sites that are serviced by the public in areas of high demand are not, unfortunately, active in terms of regeneration and bringing those sites back into use for housing. Deputy Mulherin's amendment No. 1 relates to the definition of the owner of a site, which I will deal with in more detail. Given the thrust of the debate, it is useful to consider some of the statistics in respect of NAMA's involvement in the provision of housing. The agency has already delivered more than 1,600 housing units, 5,800 are in the process of obtaining planning permission, and 2,400 are under construction across 40 sites. In addition, planning permission will be sought in respect of a further 4,300 units this year, and 13,600 units are at preplanning stage. We all know that one of the several impediments to the construction of housing in the private sector is the issue of access to credit for builders. It is interesting, therefore, to note that NAMA funded 43% of all completed units in County Dublin in recent years. Moreover, in the past 18 months, NAMA sold land that is capable of delivering 10,300 housing units. We need to be active on a number of fronts to address the problems in the housing sector. Local authorities were not, in the past, given the funding to do what they are statutorily obliged to do, which is to provide housing. That funding is now being provided. It will never be enough to meet all existing need, but the first phase has been announced and is having an impact. In addition, the approved housing bodies' allocations will be announced in the coming weeks and there will be a further phase of local authority direct provision housing announced shortly after that. It is interesting to note that planning applications in the first three months of this year are up 30% on the same period last year. Units are in the pipeline, in other words, but the problem we face is what to do in the meantime. I acknowledge that Deputy Boyd Barrett is genuine in the concerns he raised. However, if he was standing tomorrow where I am today and he had full powers to do whatever he wanted, he would not be able to deliver the number of houses he would like to deliver no matter what he tried to do. To cut off the private sector as he proposes would only escalate the problem significantly. Whether or not he agrees with it from an ideological perspective, we are dependent on the private sector to house many of those people who are under threat of homelessness and the people coming into the housing market. It is important, therefore, to incentivise the sector to get building again. Not only will that ensure more houses come on stream, the measures and provisions in this Bill will ensure we maximise existing sites that are already serviced. It means we will not have to look to the greenfield sites which cost far more to develop in terms of the public services that have to put in place before a single unit is built on them. These measures are just one element of the response by the Government to the housing shortage. There are many more fronts we need to tackle. We can debate the ins and outs of this all day long but, ultimately, it is about how we can supply more houses. There is no single solution or magic bullet. This Bill is about addressing one particular issue, namely, the shortage of supply in high-demand urban areas. The objective is to get those sites moving by way of the introduction of a vacant site levy and other measures. Returning to amendment No. 1, the relevant section of the Bill provides for the definition of the owner of a site. The amendment proposes that this definition be amended such that where land is under the de facto control of NAMA, the latter shall be deemed to be the owner of that land for the purposes of the Act. Under the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, loans have been acquired by the agency. Except for a very small number of cases, however, NAMA is not the owner or manager of the properties in question. Its role is essentially like that of a bank or secured lender. Other than in the case of properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on the agency's website and are managed by the appointed receivers and administrators, the properties continue to be managed by their existing owners. In enforced cases, the receiver is appointed to take the place of the property owner as an independent officer and to act in accordance with clear statutory obligations. This would apply to NAMA in the ordinary course, as to anybody else. The definition of owner in the Bill is consistent with that set out in both the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, of which, on enactment, this Bill will form part. This legislation provides that where the vacant site levy is determined to apply to a site, the owner must be clearly identifiable. This will ensure the efficiency of the measures. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

For the past three to four years, I have been raising various questions and issues to do with NAMA, at the finance committee, by way of parliamentary questions and directly with the Minister in the House. Most of the answers I received left a lot to be desired. When NAMA was established, we were assured there would be parliamentary oversight of its activities. However, when representatives of NAMA come before the Committee of Public Accounts, I cannot put any questions to them because I am not a member of that committee. When they attend a meeting of the finance committee, each member only has a very short slot in which to ask questions. Considering the scale of the activity of NAMA, there must be proper oversight of its operations. Many developers have been brought to their knees under its remit. Indeed, NAMA has been engaged in bully boy tactics, trading on the negative sentiment in general towards developers, notwithstanding that some of them are in NAMA through no fault of their own. We are all familiar with the Paddy McKillen case. I referred to the case of Michael O'Flynn, where the second highest bidder was successful. What about value for money for taxpayers? When one asks these questions, one is left wondering. There is still an opportunity to put in place the type of oversight I am suggesting. My amendment No. 1 is very simple. NAMA has control over vast banks of property and, as such, should be subject to the same rigours as private property owners. This is not just about developers. As I said at committee, these measure could potentially affect the little old lady up the street who has a property she cannot afford to develop. If a local authority decides to proceed in a certain way as part of its core strategy, this type of thing will happen. That is why it was so important that councils were included in the provisions. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, which is precisely my point in respect of NAMA. I do not accept the Minister of State's argument that NAMA is like a bank. NAMA is more than a bank. It is engaged in activities as a developer, as we are discussing here, although we might not be happy with its level of activity. It is also engaged in joint ventures. Is the Minister of State saying this is what banks do? To capture the actual situation that pertains in regard to NAMA's care and control of properties and its track record in regard to developers, these provisions should apply to the agency.

It has been a disaster and will prove to be one of the scandals of the country in the future. There are a lot of questions to be answered. When it was set up we could not get answers to from it about anything that was going on, no matter what parliamentary question we submitted. It was set up by the previous Government to deliver a social dividend. We were told properties could not be transferred to local authorities for social housing, which is another disaster because the vast majority of properties should have been used to deal with waiting lists. That did not happen, and we have ended up with many leasing arrangements with NAMA. It is accumulating funds, we are paying it and the funds are used to pay developers. Such a policy is scandalous and makes no sense. The large portfolios have been sold off. What is the rush? Am I missing something in terms of why the Government is forcing NAMA to move quickly and sell off properties? They have been sold at knock-down prices and people are being put in jeopardy. Those living in some of the properties that have been sold on are being put under pressure, which is adding to the housing problem. The Minister of State mentioned the housing crisis. We have a major crisis. I do not know where he is coming from when he says the housing crisis is being addressed. It is quite clear that in the past year, and since the death of Jonathan Corrie, that the number of people and families that have become homeless has doubled. I attended meetings at Christmas with the Minister of State. One would have sworn that the housing crisis would be resolved. The Minister of State mentioned the €3.8 billion that was going to be spent on housing and the €2.5 billion to be allocated over the next couple of years. Where is the money? I have spoken to local authorities, which have not received it.

Everything else flows from that. It is important, in demanding the necessary independent investigation of the sale of its assets, to note that there are a hell of a lot of questions to be answered about the large portfolios which have been sold off at a fraction of their par value and whether the public interest was protected. All of this can only happen because of the flawed mandate of NAMA, which the Government should have changed. Some of us on this side of the House called for it to be changed from the minute we entered here, saying it needed a much stronger social mandate. The social dividend aspect of NAMA was tacked on, as we all know, to assuage public concern about these matters. However, NAMA was told to get the money in as fast as it possibly could and that the Government did not care how it got it; hence, assets were flogged to vulture funds. That inevitably opens the door to possible corruption and dodgy dealing. This is not about ideology. Wherever there is a sale of State assets or the handing out of State contracts to private interests, corruption exists. It happened in Italy with the Mafia and in Russia with the oligarchs. Corruption is an inevitable by-product of the process. I will give the Minister of State a more detailed answer on what I would do if I was Minister when we deal with the next amendment.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	263	We will not be able to sleep tonight waiting for that. The Minister of State referred to the private sector. As he might understand, I would not cut it out. Rather, I would consult with it. The private sector has a few different parts. The construction sector alone comprises land bankers, developers and builders. Most of the units currently being built will be rented rather than sold. One might say that at least they will be put on the market. The Minister of State said NAMA sold land that would allow 10,300 units of housing in Dublin alone, but whom was it sold to? Many assets are being sold in parcels so large that Irish individuals, including builders and developers, have not been able to buy them. The people with the deepest pockets have mainly come from places outside Ireland, such as America. NAMA refused to divide assets and sell them in such a way that private investors in Ireland could afford to get involved. I will not go into the decision to sell all of the Northern Ireland portfolio in one block; it is an argument for another day. The Minister of State referred to land that would allow 10,300 units of housing. When will they be built? It is not attractive for a builder or developer to build a serious number of units in Ireland today. It would be difficult to get the money from a bank because the figures do not add up; too many assets have been sold in fire sales, particularly by NAMA and the banks. Units were bought too cheaply, for less than the cost of building them. How can one build and compete with such units? It is a major problem.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	264	I listened carefully to the Minister of State's response on the amendment and understood it as far as I could. I would like some elaboration on what Deputy Mulherin said, given her legal background. I refer to the management and holding in trust of land belonging to the person or company that took out the loan in the first instance and the same person or company's inability to meet the demands of the loan. It would lead one to believe that NAMA would be not only taking in trust but taking in charge, which might constitute it as the owner. I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on that in order to set my mind at ease before we vote on the amendment. I am sure Deputy Mulherin would also like such a clarification. I refer to NAMA's contribution to and ability to succeed in various local authorities throughout the country. I suggest that the Minister consider putting in place or instructing local authorities to have dedicated NAMA teams within each local authority to liaise exclusively with NAMA in order to realise a dividend in the areas for which they have responsibility.  I do not see much within the Bill to incentivise the private sector to play its part in the reactivation of the housing market. I am conscious of what Deputy Wallace has said. The price of constructing units now far outweighs the prices that will be paid by those buying the units in bulk, and for a construction sector that is to compete properly and effectively, that poses a problem in its own right. If that is to be resolved and if we were playing on a level playing field, the best way to incentivise the private sector, given that credit is not flowing for up to 50% of builders, may be the setting up of a strategic investment fund in such a way that a home development fund would fund developers at competitive rates. The profits derived from that could be reinvested by the State in providing local authority units over and above 20%, rather than the 10% the Government wishes to have from such developments, as provided in the legislation.

If anything, the amendment would potentially cause confusion and concern about inconsistency in the application of the levy by indicating the obligations of the actual owner may be different depending solely on the lending institution from which he or she borrows. This is why we oppose the amendment. Deputies spoke about economic viability and how to get the private sector going again. The Bill is just one mechanism being adopted to address viability issues and reduce overheads. The Bill has three main parts. We will reduce Part V obligations from 20% to 10%, and we will speak about this in more detail later. The Bill deals with the ability of local authorities to reduce the development levies on existing planning permissions which builders state are not viable and cannot deliver houses. There will be flexibility for local authorities to reduce the cost so that they can get building. The third measure is the vacant site levy, about which we have spoken. There will also be other measures. The Government will make other interventions on a number of fronts to stimulate and normalise the construction market so we can increase supply. It is important that this happens, and we need to continuously evaluate how delivery is going. NAMA's mandate has five strategic objectives, which are to redeem senior debt of €30.2 billion by the end of 2018 and subordinated debt of €1.6 billion by March 2020; optimise income and the disposal value of assets; deliver grade A offices in the Docklands strategic development zone; deliver 4,500 new housing units by the end of 2016; and make a positive social and economic contribution. This is the mandate and it is what NAMA is working towards. For the information of Deputies, 90% of NAMA sites are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, which will be the main focus for the Bill in terms of regeneration of urban sites.

Although all efforts should be made to use such lands for social housing, this is not possible due to the lack of funding from the State. At present, Dublin City Council owns land to build thousands of houses, but it does not receive the funding to build them. Imposing this levy would only make it more difficult and would lead to lands being sold off to private developers or speculators who can afford the levy or afford to build. It could also mean that levies would be imposed on lands that local authorities zone for parks, other play areas or areas of land sprinkled around. Where would it end? This is a bad idea with regard to local authorities and publicly owned sites, which are very important for various reasons, and there should be flexibility. In the past we have turned much of this land and many of these vacant sites into playgrounds and other amenities. The possibility of levies on any of these lands would be a disaster.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	269	I have thought about this since Committee Stage, and when the Bill is added together with the social housing strategy it would be fair to say it is something of a pincer movement to force the further privatisation of social housing. If local authorities are levied for a failure to develop lands in their ownership, and if they do not have the money to build social housing because the central government does not give it to them, they will either sell the land or be forced into arrangements which effectively privatise the land through public-private partnerships. They will have to do this to avoid the levies and get capital from the private sector. That is the plan. This dovetails with all of the other measures in the social housing strategy. If announcements about housing solved the housing crisis we would have solved it in the past year, but when we look at the detail of the social housing strategy and start to parse through the numbers we see the pressure on the local authorities, to which this measure will add, to privatise land. When we look at the detail behind the targets for social housing 2020 strategy, we really begin to see that the strategy is the wholesale privatisation of social housing. Taking the social housing strategy for 2015 as a sample of what is coming between now and 2020, the response to one of our councillors who wrote to the Minister trying to get a breakdown was very illuminating. According to the reply, the Minister expects that 7,400 new social housing units will be provided in 2015, broken down as follows: 1,400 units will be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies; 3,000 will be under the social housing leasing initiative; 1,000 will be vacant local authority units which will be returned to use; and 2,000 will be new rental allowance scheme units. This amounts to 7,400 units. In addition, there will be 8,400 new housing assistance payments. Out of a total of approximately 15,000, 2,000 plus 3,000 plus 8,400 will be from the private sector. The vast majority will be money going out to developers and landlords in the private sector. A tiny fraction of the big headline social housing commitment being made by the Government will be through the direct provision of local authority housing. The rest of it will be under various rental and leasing arrangements with private landlords and private developers, the very people to whom we have just sold all of these massive portfolios for a song. These vulture funds or speculators have benefited from the misery inflicted on the rest of us in terms of austerity, the cost of the crash and the cost of the bailout. These guys come in, buy the stuff for a song and will rent it back to the local authorities, sucking huge amounts of money on an annual basis out of the public coffers and into their swelling bank accounts. This, of course, also has the advantage of driving up rents and property prices because, if it were possible, it is an even smaller cartel than the previous cartel of developers and land bankers. We will have an even smaller golden circle of people controlling the vast majority of rental and commercial land and profit in the State.This includes private rental and commercial property etc. It is an absolute pincer movement, a scam of unbelievable proportions, with which we will at an even more intense level do again what caused the last crash. The last lot in power made an absolute bags of it and reduced social housing provision to a trickle but this Government is, more or less, closing it down. That was the announced policy in July 2011, when it was publicly indicated that direct social housing provision would be stopped. Even with the slight reversal of that at the rhetorical level, in reality the Government is continuing along that line.

How can they be explained? From a total of 15,000 housing units next year, only 1,400 will be new council houses. That means 10% of the social housing that the Government has indicated it will deliver next year will be council housing, with slightly over 80%, taking into account the returned units, being sourced from the private sector. This, in conjunction with the housing assistance payment, HAP, is a wholesale move into the privatisation of social housing. The voluntary housing bodies, generally speaking, are decent organisations with decent people in the social housing area for the right reasons. Still and all, many people would prefer to be in council houses than in housing provided by the approved housing bodies. I bet that most of the 1,400 houses is not council housing but rather stock from approved bodies. In England, as the voluntary housing sector expanded at the expense of direct provision of social housing, it became big business as well. For-profit operators began to move to the voluntary housing sector and I can guarantee that will happen here too. The Minister of State has challenged us on making these criticisms by asking us what we would do. I, along with most of the people making these contributions today, have been saying since the week we came in here what we would do. We have been saying it almost on a weekly basis for approximately four years. It is disingenuous to say we have not put our views forward but, for the record, I will do so again. The total cost of projects like the rental accommodation scheme or RAS, HAP and the various ways in which we subsidise private landlords and developers in the social housing sector is approximately €1 billion per year. That includes RAS, social leasing and rent allowance, and it is money going out and down the flipping drain. If we take 15 years, for example, to solve the problem, we could spend €15 billion on a serious emergency social housing programme that would build 20,000 or 30,000 social houses per year for the next five years. It would cost much money up-front but that would be recouped within ten or 15 years because every single council house built is money saved in the long term. That would equate to money not going out of the State coffers into the pockets of private landlords. It would be a sure-fire, guaranteed winner for State if we built directly provided council housing. We would own the asset and it would be much more secure accommodation for the tenants and so on. It would also generate money for the State through rental revenue. Another big effect would be regulation of the housing market in general by keeping down property prices. If a tiny oligarchy of developers and vulture funds controls all the property, we are guaranteed bubbles and busts because we have no control over what they do. This can be counteracted with a big bank of social housing, which would act as a sort of deadening weight on property bubbles occurring in the first place. That would keep down the general level of property and rental costs. In the 1940s and 1950s, when the State had far less money than it does now, at least we understood that logic. When Ireland was virtually a Third World country, we built thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of council houses per year. How did people manage that? They knew it was a good investment. As the proportion of housing provided in any given year has become less public and more private, we have ended up where we now are, complete with bubbles and crashes. This idea would be an investment against future crises, not to mention saving the State money and, most importantly, dealing with the catastrophic housing crisis we now face. The Minister of State might argue that we could not achieve that in a year or two. If the Government had listened when we argued for this in 2011, we would not be in the current mess. If the Government admitted that the housing list is a disaster and it messed it up but it would rectify it, even if people were not housed in a year, they could be housed in the next two to three years. That would at least give people hope. This does not even consider the construction work that would be generated, taking people off the live register and giving employment at a local level. All of this would provide hope and enthusiasm to people, who could believe that we are seriously dealing with the problem. There would of course have to be temporary measures in the mean time and there is no good solution in this regard. That is the cumulative cost we are paying for the failure to get this right over the past 20 years. We should start now and recognise what we did in essentially abandoning the provision of council housing over the past 20 years. The process has worsened under this Government but it was a disaster under the last Government as well, when resources were reduced to a trickle. This was a major contributor to the property madness, as housing came to be seen as just a commodity on which to speculate rather than an essential element of society. Even the economy will now pay a price. Government Deputies often see us as the bleeding heart liberals who want to do everything for everybody but who do not know how to pay for it. Those Deputies see themselves as the hard-headed pragmatists who really understand the economics of the issue. If we do not deal with the cost of accommodation, property and rental prices and the lack of affordable accommodation, there will be a serious problem even for the Government's beloved foreign direct investment. Even the multinationals know that people need affordable places in which to live, although they do not want to pay any higher taxes to provide them. Jesus Christ, I would not want to say that Guinness had particularly enlightened capitalists but even that company built social housing and understood that its workers, from whom they wished to profit, had to have somewhere to live, or else those people could not go to work the following day. The capitalists from the 19th century were more progressive than the gang of multinational vultures that we now have. They will not do it unless the Government indicates that housing must be provided for all sorts of reasons, including macroeconomic and humanitarian reasons. There is a basic right to housing and a decent, dignified existence for human beings, whether one argues from the bleeding heart liberal perspective or the hard-headed macroeconomic side.Instead, with this Bill and the other measures it is taking, the Government is pretty much outsourcing the lot. That is going to be an absolute disaster. That was a slight digression from the amendment, but the point about the amendment is that imposing this levy on local authorities will be a pressure for them to privatise, either directly by selling the land or indirectly by engaging in public private partnerships, which will effectively privatise it.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	272	I am not sure where the idea to levy the local authority is coming from. Putting a levy on a land-banker who sits on his land and refuses to develop it is obviously a great idea, but I do not see why the Government wants to do the same to local authorities, except that it thinks the local authority will sit on it as well. If a private investor has a site that is zoned for development and he decides not to build on it, there is a reason for it. He is deciding that it is a better idea not to develop it just yet. He is making a financial decision. If the local authority decides not to build, or is not building, I imagine it is because it does not have the money. The Government has decided it will only levy sites where housing is needed, although I would prefer if all land zoned for development that was bought for investment purposes was levied, but we will argue about that in later amendments. If the local authority has land and there is a need for housing, obviously the State should give it to them. I said in my last contribution that it is really important that the private sector plays a part in the construction of apartments and housing, but the truth is that we will continue to have a housing crisis until the State decides to start building housing again. There is a number of factors at play. I agree with the Central Bank's new rules, but the result is that up to 50% of people, young people between 20 and 30 years, who might be looking to buy a home in the near future if they settle down and start a family will not be able to afford to buy a property. That is for a number of reasons, including the Central Bank regulations. They are sensible, but the result is that the State must take more responsibility for providing housing for those who need it and who cannot afford to buy it. That number is going to grow. Some local authorities have land and are not developing it because they could not get State money because the State did not want to invest any more in the construction of housing than it had decided. Sadly right now there does not seem to be an appetite for the State to start building many houses. As the Government's so-called strategy specified before Christmas, it will remain very dependent on the rental market for its housing. The lack of joined-up thinking is a bit scary. I have made the point in here on a number of occasions that much of the development land that is out there now has been bought by the big investment funds. Of the ones that have decided to build on it, I can assure the House that they will not sell the majority of the units they build because from a financial point of view it is not a very clever thing to do at the moment. It makes far more sense, if they have the money to invest in building them and given that they got the land much cheaper than they would normally expect, to rent them out. That is what these big players have been doing and it is one of the reasons rents have gone so high. As I pointed out before, I have seen the rent for a rental property in a working class area of Dublin city centre on the north side of the river go from €1,000 a month to €1,400 a month in three years. The reason is that there are now so few players controlling the rental market. They can dictate the price. Whatever influence they have on the price currently, it will increase because these guys bought land at a fire-sale price, they had the deep pockets to do it because the land was sold in large parcels, and now they are going to build on it and rent out units. Places like Dublin are brilliant places to rent property. They are hard to beat. I am not exaggerating, but one can rent a two-bed apartment in Turin for €300 a month and we are looking at around €1,400 in Dublin. That is the place to be. There is no point in those fellows building apartments in Turin and renting them out. They will not be going over there, but they will like this place. If we are going to have a housing strategy that is geared towards huge dependence on the rental market, rent supplement is going to be too expensive for the State. Currently, rent supplement does not meet the rent, because rent is too high and the State does not want to pay too much in rent supplement. That gap is going to grow. If the Government wants people to avail of the private market, because there will not be State-built houses for them, its bill for rent supplement will be so large that it cannot be a sustainable way forward. The Government will have to rethink it. We have so many issues around it. It does not look likely that we will introduce serious rent control and even if we did, it would take a couple of years before it would work properly. The chances of us getting to grips with the housing crisis in Ireland in the next two years are almost non-existent because of the approach we are taking. I know the Government cannot provide social housing overnight, but although Rome was not built in a day, they did start it one day. We should start building houses ourselves now. I do not agree with the public private partnership model. One of the most outrageous laws in the European Union is that an EU state is not allowed to borrow money at market rates to invest in infrastructure. They insist on it going on the books. States are confined by the rules about 3% of GDP and are not allowed to escalate it. If a state borrows all this money for infrastructure, it ends up breaking EU rules.I do not see much sense in that and I would like to hear someone make a good argument as to why the EU would not encourage investment in infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure is a powerful use of money. It is an investment in the future and it creates significant employment. Although money is so cheap - one can borrow significant sums for less than 2% on the markets - the Government will not borrow it for social housing because the EU rules do not really allow that. There are different mechanisms to get around this. They are creating little pockets where one can do different things, but how in God's name can the EU stand over the rule that the State is not allowed borrow money cheaply, keep it off the books and invest it in infrastructure? It is a no-brainer. There is no logic to not allowing it. What happens is that the State can only invest X amount in social housing or other infrastructure because it is confined by the rules. If it wants to do something else in the public sector, it must go to the public private partnerships, PPPs. PPPs are really a licence for the private sector, like vultures, to feed off the carcass of the State that cannot borrow any more money at market rate. We want the work done but we have exhausted the borrowings that we are allowed to work into the system without breaking EU rules so we must now go to the PPPs. PPPs can cost anything up to approximately the 15% mark. Thanks to EU rules, instead of the State borrowing money for less than 2%, it will give private investors 15% over a longer period of time for their investment. I still almost feel uncomfortable using the word "neoliberal" in the House but the core of neoliberalism is the drive to privatise social services. Obviously, another aspect of it is the reduction of workers' rights and conditions. It has led us to a situation where there has been a serious increase in zero-hour contracts. Everyone throws their hands up in the air when workers, such as those in Dunnes Stores, are on the receiving end of that same philosophy. Everyone states this is not fair, but yet we go along with the neoliberal philosophy. That is why I believe that if people want fairness in Ireland, they should challenge every person who stands in the next election to state whether he or she is prepared to be part of a neoliberal grouping after the election or not. It is that important; it is crucial. Obviously, I will not get into the argument about Greece but it is part of the same argument. It is sad the way in which it has developed.  The European Union was about something else, or at least I thought it was, when it began. I thought it was about not only keeping peace in Europe and avoiding wars but about raising the living standards of people across Europe in general, in particular, on the peripheries, closer to that of those who were doing better than themselves. Sadly, as it stands, I now see neoliberalism as driving down living standards. It is reducing democracy and Greece is very much on the receiving end of it. Many in Ireland also are on the receiving end of it.  When in years to come people read the history of the period from 2008 to date, and probably later, how NAMA has operated, who has benefited from it and who is picking up the tab, they will find it hard to believe. We have serious problems and, as I keep saying, our housing crisis is not disconnected from that. The failure to build State housing now and the strategy of over-dependence on a rental market, which we are not able to control and which we will even struggle to ensure is affordable for many people, will be a massive problem. I had better let Deputy Cowen speak before he goes home.

Rather than elaborating, I support the proposed amendment pending a better explanation from the Minister of State on what exactly is entailed. Is it that the Government proposes to levy local authorities for hoarding land, despite their best intentions to do otherwise? There must be a better and more succinct and clear way in which one can adjudicate on the local authorities' performance in their efforts to develop the lands that they have in their possession as time passes. Specifically, I want to ask about the land aggregation scheme. Much of the land purchased by local authorities around the country was purchased at exorbitant prices but there has been an inability to both make repayments and develop those lands. Would it be possible for NAMA to give this social dividend in so far as it could make available funding to local authorities to address that issue of land that was purchased and that is now sitting in land aggregation schemes? Who is responsible, if there is to be a levy on vacant sites throughout the country? Who exactly would be responsible for those lands that are now in that scheme and that are not necessarily the responsibility of various local authorities throughout the country which purchased them with the intention of development but found themselves unable to do so without the State's backing and funding to do so? I acknowledge it may well have been, especially in the earlier years since the crash, that the funding was not readily available on the part of Government to address that but, obviously, the State has met the interest costs related to those lands.  When we hear now of the difficulties with regard to the State, more particularly, local authorities, not being able to benefit from the proceeds of NAMA, is this an opportunity whereby legislation could be brought to in to allow NAMA invest in developing these lands, among others? If there is to be a levy, will the Minister of State clarify whose responsibility it is in the case of those lands specifically within that scheme?

I do not say this lightly, as the fact of the matter remains there are 300,000 standard variable rate mortgage customers who are being charged way over the odds at rates that we now know are double the levels of elsewhere in the eurozone. On tonight's "Six One News", we heard that the European Commission had come out against any intervention by the Central Bank in the variable rates that are being charged. It will not surprise many in Ireland that the European Commission is backing the banks and not ordinary mortgage holders, but it is the job of the Government, including the Minister for Finance, to protect those mortgage holders who are still being charged excessive variable rates. With every month that passes, they must come up with more interest than anyone else in Europe. We will outline the reasons this is not acceptable and how the matter can be addressed. This issue has been firmly on the political agenda since the end of March, when we tabled a motion during Private Members' time on the subject. Since then, the campaign for mortgage fairness has gained momentum and I acknowledge the work of Mr. Brendan Burgess, Ms Sarah Hogan and other members of the campaign for their tireless efforts in this regard. The debate on the public airwaves and in the print media has galvanised public opinion and has been an example of the power of political campaigning. There is greater awareness than there was a few months ago of the extent to which variable rate mortgage customers are being ripped off in Ireland. Let us remember the scale of what we are discussing. There are 300,000 residential mortgage customers with variable rate mortgages in this country. Collectively, they owe €40 billion. Overall, a 1% interest rate cut across the board would save families €400 million every year. A 2% rate cut would provide a stimulus of €800 million to the economy in a 12-month period. This aspect of the debate is often overlooked. With every passing month that families pay sky high interest rates, they have less money to spend in the domestic economy. Their plight should be as important to the Government as is its determination to make the banks profitable again. I repeat the view that I expressed in March to the effect that the variable rates being charged by the banks are not justified based on their cost of funds. In his address to the Oireachtas finance committee, the Central Bank Governor, Professor Honohan, accepted:A widening of mortgage interest rate spreads over policy rates also occurred in the United Kingdom and in many euro area countries after the crisis but spreads have begun to narrow in the UK and elsewhere. Until recently, bank competition has been too weak in Ireland to result in any substantial inroads on rates.Like all Deputies, I have been inundated with a large volume of correspondence, including e-mails and telephone calls, from people who are directly affected by this issue. They feel a sheer sense of frustration because, as banks have enjoyed reduced funding costs and record amounts of cheap funding from the ECB, ordinary families have not been able to benefit from same. The banks' response to our raising of this issue was first to deny the existence of a problem and then to drop a few crumbs from the table. Despite the fact that variable rates in Ireland are more than 2% higher than the euro area average, the only bank to offer a straight cut in its variable rate has been AIB. This was announced before that bank's meeting with the Minister for Finance. Permanent TSB has offered a change in its pricing that leaves it still charging a 4.3% variable rate to borrowers above the 90% loan-to-value ratio. This is outrageous. The essential purpose of the meetings between the Minister and the banks in recent weeks was to reduce the exorbitant standard variable rates being charged by the latter. At the time, carefully placed media leaks indicated that variable rate cuts of 0.75% would be on the way over a period. It now looks like this will not happen and the Minister has been duped. For example, where is the Bank of Ireland variable rate cut? In essence, that bank is refusing to cut its inflated variable rate of 4.5% and is instead effectively trying to force existing customers to lock into a two-year fixed rate. The banks have not met the test set for them by the Central Bank in its recent report on the mortgage market, which reads, "Greater transparency surrounding the variable interest rate policies operated by each bank would help in this regard." If anything, the pricing process has been made more convoluted, with KBC tying in a reduction in its rates for customers moving their current accounts to that bank. As matters stand, customers have been left bewildered as to why they are paying higher rates for their mortgages, given that European Central Bank, ECB, rates have fallen to an historic low. The latest retail interest rates published by the Central Bank on 12 June showed that the average rate in the euro area for a new mortgage was 2.02%. Current variable rates on new housing loans in Ireland averaged at 4.13% in the first quarter of this year. Many existing customers are paying even more. It is important to put on the record the current rates that apply in Ireland for a variable rate customer with a loan-to-value ratio of between 80% and 90%: AIB's is 3.9%; KBC's rate for mortgage holders who move their current accounts to that bank is 4.3%; Ulster Bank's rate is 4.3%; Permanent TSB's is 4.2%; ICS, now known as Dilosk, has a rate of 4.35%; Bank of Ireland's rate is 4.5%; Danske Bank's is 4.95%; and ACC Bank, now Rabobank, has a rate of 4.4%. These rates are little changed from the rates that applied before the Minister, Deputy Noonan, met the banks. The main focus of their response has been to change their fixed rate offerings. In other words, existing standard variable rate customers continue to get a raw deal from the banks. In fact, the people who have gained the least from this initiative are those in negative equity or who have little equity in their properties. The irony is that those who most need assistance by way of an interest rate cut have not received one. Why is it acceptable that the pricing of variable rate mortgages would be so out of line with market conditions? The essence of a variable rate is that it should vary in line with them. Are we really suggesting that, if those conditions deteriorated, the banks would have to be asked twice to increase their rates to take account of it? I do not believe so. I watched the Minister for Finance on "Six One News" this evening. The most depressing aspect is that he seems to believe that the banks have moved enough on this issue. I got the distinct impression that he would like to close this file for good. Instead, he should revert to the banks and tell them that the response has not been adequate and that, fundamentally, they have not dealt with the key issue of variable rate mortgage pricing. The lack of progress on the standard variable rate issue will be made worse in the next two years or so, as mortgage interest relief is due to end entirely at the end of 2017. This will particularly affect variate rate customers paying high interest rates. Reducing fixed rates is not an adequate response for standard variable rate customers, as it may not be suitable for a large cohort of them. For example, Bank of Ireland will not allow existing customers to fix their interest rates for a period of less than two years. This comes at a price for them, as they may not be able to benefit from future rate reductions or lower rates from new market entrants, whom I hope will emerge even though there is no sign of any yet. Mortgage holders who want to sell their homes while on fixed rate mortgages could end up having to pay penalties for breaking their fixed terms early. Any person who is lucky enough to receive a lump sum from a redundancy or inheritance while on a fixed rate and wants to use it to reduce the balance on his or her loan may also be hit with a large financial penalty. The variable rate product should be priced appropriately for customers. In simple terms, the issue has not been resolved. In effect, banks have openly defied the Minister.This is why I believe moral persuasion on the banks will not in itself be enough. A legislative response is now needed. This evening, the Minister essentially encouraged customers to take up the fixed rate offer and made a prediction on the future direction of interest rates. In my view, this is not the role of the Minister for Finance. His job should be to get the best possible deal for this country's mortgage holders, rather than advising them to sign up to the fixed-rate products that the banks have now offered. Our comprehensive legislation would apply to all entities providing, managing or administering mortgages. This is very important as it would bring in mortgages that have been sold to vulture funds. If the Central Bank concludes that a "market failure" exists under our legislation, it will be empowered with a range of tools to influence the standard variable rates that are charged, including the power to issue a specific direction to a lender. This process would have the distinct advantage of protecting customers of smaller lenders and families whose loans have been sold to overseas equity or vulture funds. Currently, there is absolutely nothing to prevent an existing financial institution or a US equity fund from increasing the rate of interest on a mortgage to 6%, 7% or 8% - this point is fundamental to understanding why this legislation is needed - and that is exposing every mortgage holder in this country to an unacceptable level of risk. It is a fact that the trend is for banks to dispose of their mortgage portfolios. They are increasingly disposing of them to so-called vulture funds, which are not accountable to anyone. We hope the legislation that is going through at present will deal with that issue. However, it will not deal with the issue of possible interest rate hikes, which needs to be addressed. Under this Bill, the Central Bank will be required to carry out an assessment of the state of the mortgage market, taking account of 11 considerations including institution-specific factors such as the cost of funds, the weighted average cost of capital, the risk profile, the reasonable profit expectation and the proportion of market of each bank. It will also have to consider general market factors such as the ease with which borrowers can switch mortgages between lenders and the extent to which they are switching. If the Central Bank concludes that a market failure exists, this legislation will empower it with a range of tools to influence the standard variable rates that are being charged. For example, it will be able to direct a lender not to charge a rate which exceeds a specified minimum or maximum rate; a margin above the lender's cost of funds, as determined by the Central Bank; a margin above the ECB rate; or a proportion, for example, more than one third, above the average variable interest rate being charged in the market. Such interventions are common elsewhere in Europe. This Bill is not simply a response to the current circumstances in the mortgage market. It is intended that it will bring about a permanent improvement in consumer protection for mortgage holders. The Court of Appeal ruling in the Millar case essentially means the courts have found that the law as it stands cannot be invoked by a mortgage customer who feels that his or her bank has hiked the standard variable rate to an excessive extent. Judge Hogan's earlier ruling that Danske Bank had acted incorrectly in raising its variable rate at a time when the European Central Bank was actively cutting its lending rates had offered a chink of light for mortgage customers, but this has now been comprehensively closed off. In essence, the law as it stands does not offer adequate protection to mortgage holders in this country. As I said earlier, this proposal would have the distinct advantage of protecting the customers of smaller and non-bank lenders and those who are exiting the market. Some 46,000 mortgages are now held by non-banks, of which 19,000 are in arrears and therefore in very vulnerable situations. Even in a generally well-functioning marketplace, there is need for measures that protect customers who are weak and vulnerable. While we hope the provisions of this Bill will never need to be implemented or used by the Central Bank on a widespread basis in the market, it is important to have powers on the Statute Book in case the Central Bank might need to use them. This legislation has an important non-discrimination clause. Some banks are now engaged in a policy of making certain offers available to new customers only. Some of the banks moved on this issue in the recent round of announcements, but not all of them did so. In March of this year, I said I felt the banks' policies in this regard were damaging their own brands. I recently received correspondence from a Permanent TSB mortgage customer who was coming off a fixed rate. This person had received a letter offering three options: a variable rate of 4.5%, a two-year fixed rate of 7.25% or a five-year fixed rate of 8.75%. This is happening at a time when the same bank is offering new customers a chance to fix their rates at between 3.7% and 4% for two years or 3.95% for five years. Such a differential in the treatment of existing customers and new customers should not be acceptable to the Government, the Central Bank or anyone else. We believe banks should be prevented from doing this in the interests of fairness. For that reason, we are proposing that banks should be required to treat new and existing customers equally. Banks must be required to open up the market for switcher mortgages in a meaningful way. They like to give the impression that they are willing to take on the mortgages of existing customers of other institutions, but the reality is that very few of them are actively involved in this side of the market. The responses given by all of them to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform recently are evidence of this. We can infer from their refusal to provide figures on the number of switcher mortgages that have actually been completed that the number in question is absolutely tiny. We all know this is the case. This issue needs to be addressed. Fianna Fáil honestly believes this is the last opportunity before the forthcoming general election to deal with this issue by way of legislation in this House. We have been pressing this issue for many months now. Some progress has been made, but it has been very limited. It is unacceptable that the response from the banks, which has been minimalist in nature, has left many customers behind. The focus of our Bill is on variable rate loans. Other customers, including sub-prime mortgage holders and buy-to-let mortgage holders, are paying even higher rates of 5% or 6%. All of that underlines the fundamental need for this legislation to be enacted so that these powers are on the Statute Book. Fairness needs to be introduced to the mortgage market in Ireland to deal with the clear discriminatory practices that are being applied against up to 300,000 variable-rate customers. Such practices are not good enough and must come to an end.

Tagann sé inár láthair ó thráth go chéile, bíonn cúpla focal le rá aige agus ligeann sé air féin gur saoi nó fáidh de shaghas éigin é, ach ní bhíonn aon ghníomh uaidh ar chor ar bith. I have to say I am very disappointed that the Minister for Finance does not think this issue is important enough that he should turn up to hear from our party's spokesman, who is sponsoring this important Bill. This legislation that has been proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath is properly prepared and comprehensive. We need to look at what is happening. Variable rate mortgages are being kept at an artificially high rate. If any other consumer product were involved, the consumer affairs agency would be in here saying that a cartel is in operation. If one looks at the rates, one will see that KBC, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB have rates of 4.3%, ICS has a rate of 4.35%, Bank of Ireland has a rate of 4.5% and Danske Bank has a rate of 4.95%. The outlier here is AIB, which has a rate of 3.9%. What are they doing? They are penalising the most vulnerable borrowers of long-term finance in the State - those who borrowed on variable rates during the boom - because they lost money as a result of giving out too many tracker mortgages and being unable to run their affairs efficiently. What is the Government doing about it? I am reminded of summer 2012, when the Minister and the Taoiseach went to Brussels and achieved a "seismic shift" in relation to the bailing out of the banks that amounted to a puff of smoke.The same thing happened in this case. Everything was supposed to happen by 1 July. That date came and, effectively, nothing of any consequence had happened. In the meantime, the banks are taking houses from people who are paying the full amount of interest and a certain amount of the capital. If the Minister does not know that is happening, he is obviously not listening to his constituents. If he knows it is happening, he knows that if the interest rates were as they should be, those people would be able to pay the full amount of their mortgage repayments. What makes the matter even more puzzling is what is happening with, for example, Bank of Ireland. That bank will give the customer a fixed rate for two years at a smaller amount than a variable rate, even though we know that the price of money on the wholesale markets will probably never be cheaper. Can the Minister explain that? Why is it giving a two-year fixed rate option cheaper than the variable rate? I could understand that being so if rates were at a historic high, but when they are at a historic low, would it not be cheaper for the bank to borrow short-term funds, or even long-term funds at present, at a cheaper rate than they are likely to be able to get them at in the future? What are the banks doing? They are trying to make money for themselves and their shareholders. There is a principle of regulation across the board, going to the heart of consumer legislation and competition law, which provides that where there is a small number of private monopolies, one does not allow them to create an effective cartel. Interestingly, if one reads the Constitution and the social guidelines at the back of the Constitution, one can see that there is provision constitutionally for an obligation to deal with this issue. This Bill is a way of doing that. It is a way of ensuring that the banks act in a fair and proper manner and stop robbing the poor people who happen to be in the unfortunate situation of having made the wrong choice, not knowing what the future would hold in terms of interest rates, in taking out a variable rate mortgage rather than a tracker rate mortgage. I hope that over the next two days the Minister will listen to the proposal put forward by Deputy McGrath, who is a thoughtful and considered person. He has put a great deal of work into researching these issues and studying all of the implications. He has come up with a rational proposal which basically deals with banks if they are overcharging and abusing their monopoly or a cartel situation in respect of a small number of customers. If they are abusing their situation, it is difficult to swap one mortgage for another, because there are all sorts of legal issues attached to swapping, such as security. The Minister is aware of all the hassle that would cause for an ordinary citizen, along with the cost of legal fees, particularly these days. Swapping mortgages is not like buying a new coat. It is quite complicated to change the lender of one's mortgage. The Minister knows that in this situation it is incumbent on the State to act, as outlined in the Constitution, to protect the interests of the citizen from exploitation. The simple thing for the Government to do tomorrow night is to say, "Deputy McGrath, you have come forward with a good way of dealing with this issue. It is a reasonable proposition, we need it to protect our citizens and we are going to support what you have done." If the Government does not do that, it will be a clear sign to mortgage holders and particularly to distressed borrowers that the Government does not care and that it is acting more in the corporate interest than in the interest of the citizen. The Government will make a clear choice tomorrow. I hope it will make the right decision, do the big thing and accept that Fianna Fáil has been making a valid point and that it must act and do something about it now rather than wringing its hands and literally doing nothing.

It is a proportionate and considered response to a real failure in the marketplace and our banking system, particularly with regard to its treatment of customers with variable rate mortgages. It is disappointing that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, indicated in his comments today that he would drop this issue and not pursue it any further. It is reminiscent of his position before he started to engage on this and recognised that it was an issue that had to be addressed. That only happened after Deputy McGrath and the Fianna Fáil Party tabled a Private Members' motion last April raising this issue and making the extent of the problem crystal clear. Due to the widespread support the motion received and the coverage it garnered, the Minister had little option but to realise and admit that there was a problem and belatedly engage with the banks. We have seen the unravelling of that process over the last couple of months and the Minister's various engagements with the banks but, unfortunately, as our party leader said on Leaders' Questions last week, the banks have pretty much told the Minister to take a hike on the issue. They have paid lip service to the problem raised with them, but their response has been exceptionally limited and, in the vast majority of cases, totally unacceptable. As Deputy McGrath outlined earlier, the response of some of the banks has been that they will only agree to offer reduced rates in respect of fixed rate mortgages for customers. Unfortunately, that is not acceptable or suitable for many customers. It prevents them from moving on or changing bank. It also prevents them from being able to avail of newer rates which might become available in the future. The other difficulty is that under many fixed rate agreements between customers and a bank, the customer is prevented from making additional payments on his or her mortgage when funds become available. Indeed, the customer can incur penalties upon reducing his or her mortgage by a greater amount, should unexpected funds become available. The Bill is very sensible, if people would take the time to read it. It is proportionate and considered in the way it addresses the problem. It provides for a requirement for the Central Bank to carry out an assessment of competition in the banking market on a quarterly basis. None of us should fear that. With regard to the powers given to the Central Bank on foot of the problems it identifies, again, the Bill is proportionate. It gives a great deal of power and responsibility to the Central Bank to reach judgments about what is reasonable in respect of rates being charged in the market. The current situation with banks in this country is that the average variable mortgage rate is 2% higher than the rate in other countries in Europe.No one can argue that this is not a difficulty or that customers are not being short-changed or used by the banks and the Government, through its failure to engage with and address this problem, to recapitalise the banks. Those with mortgages, especially large mortgages, are the most hard-pressed people in the country and are least amenable to being used by the Government as a means of recapitalising the banks.  The Bill also addresses the problem of the non-banking institutions that hold approximately 47,000 mortgages and are not restricted in respect of the mortgage rates they can charge on the loans they hold, many of which were purchased from banks. The legislation proposes to ensure that these institutions are subject to reasonable competition constraints and a requirement to protect customers.  I urge the Government to reconsider its opposition to the Bill. This is its final opportunity to address this issue properly. It must not walk away from the issue or brush it under the carpet, as is its wont with such issues. It should instead deliver some relief to some of those who most need it.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	279	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has shown great consistency in bringing this topic to public attention in recent months. The only time the Minister addresses the issue is when it is raised by Opposition Deputies. The Government would not take any action on mortgage interest rates if it were not for the Opposition and it does so on occasion only to save its own blushes when the issue is highlighted in this Chamber. This is outstanding, careful and measured legislation. The crunch issue is the proposal to require the Central Bank to carry out an assessment of the state of the mortgage market. Should the Central Bank conclude that a market failure exists, the legislation provides that it would be empowered with a range of tools to influence standard variable interest rates. A couple of qualifications apply. The Bill does not require the Central Bank to intervene but provides it only with the power to intervene. In the first instance, it must examine the mortgage market and only where it finds that the market is operating unfairly would it be empowered to take action on variable interest rates. This is a fair and reasonable approach.  In recent years, we have heard a great deal about mortgage arrears. More recently, the debate has moved on to the 300,000 people who are being crucified by variable mortgage rates, which are out of line with the European Union average. I note the post-programme surveillance report issued by the European Commission last week specifically refers to the importance of allowing banks to obtain sufficient interest rate margins as a means of sustaining the return of profitability. My party accepts that Irish banks must be profitable. Having bailed them out, we want them to be profitable, albeit not at the expense of ordinary citizens who are being gouged and forced to pay on the double. The 300,000 variable rate mortgage holders paid through their taxes to bail out the banks and are now being asked, through the variable interest rates they are being charged, to pay again to return the banks to super-profitability. This is not necessary as they are performing well.  The Commission's post-programme surveillance report notes that the standard variable rate in Ireland is relatively high compared to other European countries and states the main reason for this is credit risk with high non-performing loans and legacy assets. Referring to the recent appearance of the Governor of the Central Bank before an Oireachtas committee, the report states that the Central Bank requested that banks provide a clear and quantified statement of how they set their standard variable rates. This means the Central Bank does not know how variable mortgage rates are set. Imagine the Governor of the Central Bank informing the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that he wants a clear and quantified statement of how the banks set their variable mortgage rates. Shame on the Governor of the Central Bank. It is his job to know how the banks do this. That he can come before an Oireachtas committee and state that the banks should produce documentation and a quantified statement on how they set their rates makes him appear as if he as an observer who has come in from the street. How can the Central Bank regulate the banks if it does not even know the basis on which they set their interest rates? The Governor of the Central Bank indicated that this information was sadly lacking and subsequently argued that continued pressure on the banks to cut rates may undermine financial stability by reducing bank profitability and impact on future privatisation prospects. I do not take issue with the argument that the banks must be profitable. The Governor also argued that such continued pressure could also have negative implications for market competition by discouraging potential new entrants to the market. I have news for Professor Honohan. I do not know where he was before the problems with the banks occurred, although I know he was not in the Central Bank at the time, but competition was one of the reasons for these problems. When Bank of Scotland entered the market, it claimed it would be the Ryanair of the banking sector and offered low interest rates. All the other banks followed suit to maintain market share and this decision to chase business and engage in excessive and unbridled competition was one of the reasons for the over-lending in the market that resulted in boom and bust policies and the collapse of the financial and property sectors. Despite this, the Central Bank is arguing that we need more competition in the Irish banking market. We need the banks operating here to be regulated by the institution charged with regulating them. I am shocked by the Governor of the Central Bank's statement to an Oireachtas committee that the Central Bank requires a quantified statement on how the banks set their variable interest rates. I am also shocked that he professed not to have this information. I am not shocked that people are being overcharged when the Governor of the Central Bank does not know what is going on and makes a public plea for information. He should have summoned representatives of the banks to his desk years ago and asked them to provide this information on an ongoing basis.  One thing the Central Bank has done in recent days was to publish a report in which it noted that seven of the major financial institutions - we can assume this to mean practically all of them - have not been adhering to the mortgage arrears resolution process. I and others are aware of court cases where people have defended themselves because they did not have the financial resources required to take legal advice. They will state that the mortgage arrears resolution process was not followed in their case. When such cases are dealt with in the courts, a senior counsel will appear on behalf of the bank and he or she will be advised by a solicitor who has, in turn, been advised by the legal team of the bank in question. This team will have been advised in turn by a mortgage loan manager who will have been advised by a regional manager who has been advised by the official at branch level who dealt with the mortgage holder. The evidence is not even third hand but is at the end of six or seven links in a chain of hearsay evidence that culminates in the legal representative of the bank claiming in court that the bank in question followed the mortgage arrears resolution process. Having reviewed this matter, the Central Bank should now publish the names of the banks in question. Rather than doing this, it has stated it will write a letter to the seven institutions in question. It is again failing citizens by being docile in its dealings with the banks. It is not surprising that the banks are getting away with the statements they are making.  During the hearings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Service and Reform, we learned that the banks have over-provided for mortgage losses in recent years and a substantial element of the profits they recorded in the past 12 months is the result of writing back previous provisions. They now acknowledge that they overstated their provisions in the past and presented this information to the joint committee a couple of weeks ago. Moreover, the formula for calculating write-downs was based, among other things, on a 55% fall from peak in the market value of the properties that had been mortgaged. This year, the formula used is only 50% and with prices set to rise next year and the following year, the formula used will be a 30% fall from peak. The banks, in determining the variable mortgage interest rate, factored into their cost structures a property collapse that is now turning around. They also factored in previous arrears which they now describe as being under control. According to the banks, 62% of people in mortgage difficulties have accepted new arrangements and the majority of these arrangements are working.As such, the level of previous arrears is also declining. They have all said their cost of funds is down at 1% to 1.5% yet they are charging 4% and 4.5%. Even the European Commission in its own couched language acknowledges that an excessive margin is being made by the banks here. The Central Bank seems to know it but does not know how it is happening notwithstanding that it is its job to know. According to the little information the Central Bank does have, the banks are not following the mortgage arrears resolution process. It is no wonder they are playing ducks and drakes. It is only when Fianna Fáil and, in particular, my colleague Deputy Michael McGrath raises these issues whenever we have a chance to do so that there is a flutter of activity by the Minister and the Central Bank to yield some results. Unfortunately, the results we have seen to date are too little too late. There is scope for a substantial and significant reduction. The European Commission says so. The Central Bank does not yet know how much it should be as it has not been doing its job. If we come out of this with anything, it should be a Central Bank that is properly able to oversee rates and how they are calculated. Then, we might get some reduction. The Minister is relying on the Central Bank for information but it is clearly saying it does not know how the rates are arrived at.

He would like to be here but cannot be. As Deputy Michael McGrath knows, the Minister would be here if he could be as he does attend these debates. However, he cannot be in two places at once despite all he is able to do. The Government appreciates the concerns which Deputy Michael McGrath has attempted to address in the Bill. We know Deputy Michael McGrath's efforts and those of Fianna Fáil are genuine as it is an issue affecting a great many people. We all want to see the burden eased if at all possible. A monthly mortgage payment is the largest expense faced by most families and, as the Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware, the Minister for Finance has requested the Central Bank to examine and produce a report on the issue. Subsequently, the Minister met the six main mortgage lenders in May to outline his concerns and those of most people here. The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks in Ireland. The Minister was clear that all customers should have easy options available to them to reduce their monthly mortgage payments. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers. This is to the benefit of both existing and new customers of the banks. A key concern expressed by the Minister was that all customers, including those with high loan to value ratios, would be in a position to lower their mortgage payments. The main lenders have launched a range of measures ranging from lower standard variable rates, new loan-to-value products and fixed-rate products. In addition to meeting the banks, the Minister met with representatives from the fair mortgage rates campaign. The Minister briefed the representatives on his meeting with the banks and his expectations in the months ahead. The Minister outlined to the group his view that many of the new products offered by the banks could result in monthly savings for mortgage customers and should be considered fully by customers and their advisers. We are currently in the middle of this process and the bank's responses are being considered by the Minister and the Department of Finance. The Minister wants to see customers offered lower monthly mortgage payments. I am sure this is an objective that is shared by all Deputies in the House. The Minister has made it clear that a follow up set of meetings will take place with the banks in advance of the budget. The Minister has made it clear to the banks that the issue of a penal banking levy in the budget or powers for the Central Banks to regulate interest rates will be considered in future if sufficient progress on this issue is not made. It is therefore not the time to legislate on this issue as the effects of moves by the banks have not yet become clear and a review of the situation is ongoing. The Government is opposing this Bill and I will outline the reasons. I stress that Department of Finance officials have consulted with the Central Bank specifically on the contents of the Bill and that the Central Bank remains opposed to the regulation of interest rates. I turn to the Bill in detail. The Bill requires the Central Bank to assess whether market failure exists in the principal dwelling house, or PDH, mortgage market and permits the Central Bank to issue a direction to a lender or lenders setting a maximum interest rate defined in a number of possible ways; either a specified rate, a margin above the ECB rate or cost of funds, or a proportion above market average. The Bill also requires the Central Bank to make an assessment of competition in the mortgage market. However, there is already a separate public authority with jurisdiction in this area, which is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. I question therefore whether the Bill could create a conflict of authorities in this regard. In addition, while the Central Bank does not support the regulation of interest rates, it has advised on a brief inspection of the Bill that there are numerous other factors which would need to be taken into account in any analysis, including such an analysis as suggested by the Bill. That said, the Bill does permit other matters which are certified by the Governor as relevant to be taken into account. The Bill permits the regulation of all banks and lenders. Therefore, it would apply to newcomers to the Irish market and might hinder competition, which is crucial to exerting downward pressure on interest rates. In fact, a three-year exemption from restrictions on other fees and charges for new entrants to the Irish market is currently in place to encourage new entrants and to foster competition. In addition, the Bill does not include variable rates which are set by reference to European Central Bank interest rates. This could mean that a tracker mortgage with an unreasonably high margin above the ECB rate would not be included. On an initial consideration, it would seem that the requirement for quarterly reports appears excessive. It is not accepted that significant changes are likely to occur in the mortgage market on a quarterly basis. There may be also legal issues regarding definitions and the factors to be taken into account in the assessments. The Bill prohibits discrimination between existing and new borrowers without defining any of these terms. Another difficulty with the Bill is that it provides that the assessments should be published "as appropriate" but makes no such provision in relation to directions to lenders. It is not clear whether these should be public although there is a possibility of High Court enforcement action in the Bill, which would, presumably, be public. The Bill limits the discretion of the High Court to impose fines on lenders for failure to follow a direction. Furthermore, the Bill limits the operational freedom of lenders because it seems to only allow two ways to attract new borrowers; defraying legal costs or paying stamp duty. Other practices such as lower introductory rates or cash back directly to customers which are used in Ireland do not seem to be permitted. Of course, there are consumer protection issues associated with such practices which warrant further detailed consideration. Significantly, the Bill does not have a sunset or review clause, which means the Central Bank would be required to undertake these assessments in perpetuity unless the legislation were repealed, even if it is accepted that the market is functioning well. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is clear that the objective of the Bill is to reduce monthly mortgage payments faced by standard variable rate customers. This is an objective the Minister shares. As I have stated, the purpose of meeting the banks was to get fair monthly payments for existing as well as new mortgage customers, including those on standard variable and fixed rates. As Deputies will be aware and as I have already stated, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, met with the senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage providers in May and strongly delivered the message that change was expected. The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for mortgage customers. The Minister does not want to see one solution or mortgage offering from all of the banks but rather a competitive range of products for existing and new customers. The banks have responded to the Minister's initiative and made announcements and these are currently being reviewed. We encourage all customers and their advisors to examine the options now available and to make the best decision for their circumstances. Customers with the highest standard variable rates now have the option to lower their monthly mortgage repayments and we encourage all Deputies to ensure that their constituents are aware of the lower cost products available to them. A number of the banks have embarked on significant advertising campaigns in order to attract new customers and encourage switching. This is very important because if banks believe they may lose customers, they will be encouraged to offer more competitive rates to existing customers. Switching would also increase the overall competitive nature of the market. Customers should not be put off by the process but should approach a new bank if they wish to switch and allow it to do the work or guide them through the process. I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, or CCPC, is planning a significant public awareness campaign on switching in the early autumn which will provide additional information to consumers to encourage switching. The CCPC website, www.consumerhelp.ie, continues to be a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In relation to other initiatives undertaken by the banks, some have reduced fixed-rate options for new and existing customers while others have introduced new variable rates based on loan-to-value ratios. Therefore, there are options available to those on standard variable rates. They can stay with their lender and, where possible and where it suits their circumstances, switch to an alternative rate or, alternatively, they can look into switching lenders. I would not want to give specific advice to borrowers because it is up to each person to make up his or her own mind on whether to choose a standard variable rate or fix or not and for how long. However, I would point out that many customers have the option to make immediate monthly savings by fixing. In some cases, it would take significant and speedy additional reductions in rates in the months ahead to outweigh the immediate savings from switching now. Borrowers need to consider whether the security and peace of mind of having a fixed rate, which will not rise if interest rates rise, could outweigh the lack of flexibility which comes with fixing, particularly when some of the fixed rates on offer are lower that existing variable rates. As we have stated, the responses by the lenders are currently being reviewed by the Minister and the Department of Finance. In addition, a follow-up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the budget. We are, therefore, only in the middle of this process and to legislate now would not be appropriate. The effects of the initiatives taken by banks have not yet had time to effect change or to be evaluated by the Department of Finance. In advance of the meetings the Minister held with the main mortgage providers, the Central Bank, on the Minister's request, prepared a report on the influences on standard variable rate pricing in Ireland. This report was submitted to the Department of Finance last month and has been published on both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank websites, to which reference was made. The report provides a valuable insight into the mortgage market and I would urge all Deputies to read it carefully. It showed that 52% or €60 billion of credit advanced to Irish resident households for home purchases is on a tracker rate, a further 7% or €8 billion is fixed and the remaining 41% or €47 billion is on standard variable rates. The report finds that the spread between official European Central Bank, ECB, rates and the standard variable rate is relatively high and lending rates are above average compared to our European peers, which is a point Deputy McGrath referenced. However, it made clear that the high pricing of loans reflects three factors - credit risk, competition and bank profitability. The report went on to say that credit risk is influenced by the high level of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain process of collateral recovery. Competition is weak and this is not unrelated to the credit risk as new entrants may be deterred from entering the Irish market. Finally, bank profitability is constrained by legacy issues, but profitability is needed to build capital buffers and to meet increasing regulatory requirements. However, the report did note that the reduction in ECB policy rates has not been passed through fully to the funding costs of Irish banks. Also, non-tracker mortgage lending rates have been slower to respond to a lowering of the policy rate than to increases. Furthermore, the Central Bank thought that it is likely that the rates in effect for most banks at the end of April 2015 were higher than would be necessary in the long run for a bank unburdened by a poorly performing mortgage back book. The Central Bank highlighted that the mortgage business as a whole is not profitable for Irish banks. This reflects the high levels of non-performing loans and tracker mortgages on their books. The Central Bank suggested that the ability of the banks to partially compensate for the burden of the trackers by retaining higher spreads on variable rates is likely to be transitory, as such spreads will in time encourage entry into the market.  This report by the Central Bank sharply cautioned that any policy steps to interfere with the rates charged risks creating damaging side-effects. In the last few days, the Central Bank has reiterated to the Department of Finance its stated policy opposition to set and enforce mortgage interest rates. Acceptance of the Bill would give powers to the Central Bank that it does not want and does not want to use. Therefore, the Government, in opposing this Bill, is also taking into account the views of the Central Bank, which is opposed to having the power to regulate interest rates. In regard to the regulation of standard variable rates, on 28 May 2015, in his introductory statement to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, re-emphasised his opposition to the administrative control of interest rates. While he acknowledged that he would welcome a reduction in bank standard variable rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large, it remains his firm belief that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term - notably, as he said, because of its stultifying effect on bank efficiency and its chilling effect on the entry of other banks. While the Governor signalled that he would welcome a reduction in bank standard variable rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large, he was opposed to this being brought about by administrative controls and instead thought that competition would be the crucial determinant. The Minister has also highlighted the importance of competition in terms of exerting downward pressure on interest rates, although it is acknowledged that this competition must be tempered by prudence.  The Governor pointed out that in current conditions, the standard variable rate borrower's main protection is competition: the fact that, by setting its standard variable rate too high, any bank stands to lose business - whether new business or switchers - to competitors. However, he acknowledged that the effectiveness of this strategy was currently hampered by the low level of competition in the Irish banking sector, but that this fact further strengthens arguments against administrative control of interest rates. Ensuring that official policy does not inadvertently deter competition and entry of banks to the market is thus vital for the long-term health of the economy. Professor Honohan warned that if Ireland were to be the country that controls interest rates, this would have a signalling value far in excess of what one might think in terms of causing a retreat of service providers. The Governor very firmly cautioned against the enacting of legislation that would provide for officially-administered lending rates and the Minister has yet to see convincing evidence to justify going against this advice. He explicitly stated that:Nothing could be more likely to curtail and discourage entry of new competitors into Irish banking, and without the possibility of such entry, I cannot see that banking can recover the operational efficiency and competitive pricing that is essential for Ireland in the long run. For the sake of modestly lower standard variable rates for a few quarters, a much larger and quasi-permanent albeit somewhat invisible loss would be incurred by the customers of the banking system in Ireland. Well-capitalised banks operating more competitively will, in the end, offer lower rates and better service.In addition, the Governor highlighted that close administrative control of interest rates would not be easily compatible with the principle of an open market economy with free competition which has underpinned the considerable increase in national prosperity over the past half century in Ireland and which is enshrined in the European Union treaty. As such, the issue of administrative control is not a matter to be taken lightly or quickly for what would be at best be a transitory advantage. As the Deputies are aware, banks must operate on a profitable basis if they are to provide the services necessary to the economy, to comply with international regulations surrounding capital requirements, to be fully financially autonomous and not dependent on the State, to have the resilience to deal with future shocks and to serve customers adequately.  As I said, Department of Finance officials have consulted with the Central Bank specifically on the contents of this Bill and the Central Bank remains opposed to regulation of interest rates. It should be noted that the Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those individuals who bought homes at the height of the property boom mainly between 2004 and 2008. In this regard, in budget 2012, the Minister fulfilled the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices were at their peak. As the Minister has made clear to the banks, the issue of a penal banking levy in the budget or powers for the Central Bank to regulate interest rates will be considered in future if sufficient progress on this issue is not made. However, it is too soon to assess the scale or nature of this progress as the banks have only recently set out their responses on the issue to the Minister and these are currently being reviewed by the Minister and the Department of Finance. Moves have been made by the banks in relation to providing options for customers with regard to the availability of different lower rate products and through advertising the possibility of switching lender. The Minister has also committed to a follow-up set of meetings with lenders in advance of the budget, and this will take place in September.

Deputy Bannon will correct me if I am wrong but I understand that estate was built under a section 23 tax incentive. From what I understand about tax incentives, they are only given if something that is needed is not being produced. However, in terms of the granting of them, unfortunately, very often that was not the case. This was also the period when 100% mortgages were granted and that combined with other factors led to the crash. While I have no doubt that Deputy Michael McGrath is sincere in bringing forward this Bill which deals with a very real and difficult issue for many families, it is very hard to take it from Fianna Fáil given that it presided over all that in those years. In terms of the issue, the most important thing to say about people who are dealing with distressed mortgages is that no one should have to leave their home unless there is somewhere else for them to go to live and, most preferably, people's mortgage situation should be dealt with in such a way that they can stay where they are. The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, has outlined quite a few of the ways in which the Government is trying to tackle this issue and I will refer briefly to one or two of them.The Government is facing a dilemma in this regard because on the one hand it wants the banks to become profitable again and, on the other, it does not want to see them screwing people to the wall.  The Government has taken action in various ways on this issue. The banks were called in and the Minister for Finance made it clear that a penal banking levy or powers for the Central Bank to regulate interest rates will be considered if enough progress is not made by the banks, for example, in regard to excessive standard variable rate mortgages. There have been cuts in some interest rates. In the 2012 budget, the Government increased the rate of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers. In the 2004 to 2008 period, the rate was increased to 30%. Major reform of the personal insolvency framework is planned where the Government has agreed to give the courts power to review and, in some cases, approve insolvency deals rejected by the banks; the legislation on that will be brought forward imminently. There is a greater role for the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, and the mortgage to rent scheme has expanded.  Progress is being made in some areas. If we consider the overall figures, 84.5% of primary home mortgages, fortunately, are not in arrears. Nearly 38,000 mortgages are two years or more in arrears, which is an area of considerable concern, but it is worth noting that over 114,000 accounts have been restructured.  Overall, good progress has been made but I urge the Minister for Finance to hit the banks hard if they do not treat these mortgage holders fairly. It is vital that mortgage holders in distress are treated as fairly as possible and that we keep an eye on the banks behaviour to ensure they treat people as fairly as possible.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	283	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill proposed by Fianna Fáil concerning regulation of variable mortgage interest rates. The Bill envisages a role for the Central Bank in oversight and enforcement in the domestic mortgage market and in the relationship between borrowers and their lenders. There is some merit in the Bill but it is possibly premature given the strategy the Government has adopted. It is a terrible pity that Deputy Michael McGrath was not in a senior position in the previous Government because he might have convinced his party to concern itself a bit more with regulation of such matters in the past. Fianna Fáil presided over an utterly unsustainable regime in which 100% mortgages were routinely handed out by banks, and that was the root of many of the difficulties that subsequently arose. It is difficult, therefore, to read this Bill without some sense of irony given that it has been proposed by a party whose guardianship of the economy in the recent past can be reasonably compared to a fox's guardianship of a henhouse.  As I said, I believe the Bill is premature and in some ways it is opportunistic. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has mapped out and initiated moves to address comprehensively the issue of mortgage rates in the banking sector. To change course at this stage in the manner being suggested would not be the prudent route to pursue. The Opposition Members know that. They know that this Bill cannot possibly be supported by Government, but they propose it for the sake of headlines or a sound bite. It is symptomatic of a trend in Opposition politics in the Dáil where policies do not have to make any sense. They just have to sound good when reports of them fall on half-listening ears.  Sinn Féin, which opposes principles south of the Border while it implements them in the North, threatened to unleash a reign of economic terrorism on the country through its fairy tale type policies, and amnesia stricken Fianna Fáil beside it is struggling to feign indignation as this Government strives to fix everything they broke. While these and others scramble to outflank each other in the populism stakes, the Government is working to do something about the problems and rebuild our shattered economy on a lasting foundation of sustainable economic growth. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, met with the six main lenders earlier this year to discuss the mortgage market and the issue of high standard variable rates. The banks have agreed to review their rates by the beginning of this month to have options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers. I understand they have reverted with these proposals and they are currently being considered by the Minister and his Department. He will meet them again later this year ahead of the next budget, and it is at that point that the question of a penal banking levy or regulation of interest rates will be considered if sufficient progress has not been made. Before coming into the Chamber, I listened to a report on RTE about a draft report by the European Commission, which stated that it is important to allow Irish banks sufficient leeway in setting mortgage interest rates. I would not entirely concur with that sentiment but there is a dilemma here for Ireland in the sense that many of the Irish banks, in which the taxpayer has a stake, are returning to profitability. It appears that we will not have to avail of the retrospective recapitalisation of banks now because the State will recover its interests in the main Irish banks through sale on the open market. There is a dilemma in that regard in terms of profitability and interest rates, but taxpayers have contributed hugely to sorting out the economy and recapitalising the banks. That is where there is merit in the Bill. Something has to happen. I do not know whether punitive penalties on banks if they do not deliver is the answer because that will impact on the overall value of the banks. It is an issue that must be handled very carefully but the Minister has adopted the right position, and I hope we will see significant progress on this later this year.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	284	Deputy Dowds will be glad to know that I got considerable funding under the Government through the ghost estates initiative to have Drumlish and many other estates throughout Longford and Westmeath finished to a very high standard. We were successful in getting more funding for estates in Longford-Westmeath than any other county or region in the country. The people of Drumlish and the other villages that have benefited from funding from this Government are very proud of their area, as are all Longfordians and Westmeath people. For quite some time it has become very clear that we need to encourage strong competition for new entrants in the banking sector in order to place some downward pressure on interest rates for variable rate mortgage customers. Indeed, in February 2015, figures published by the Central Bank showed that the average variable rate for Irish mortgage holders was 4.26%. When we look towards our eurozone neighbours, we see that the average variable mortgage rate is 2.47%. We can all agree that Irish home buyers are forced to pay disproportionate amounts compared to our European counterparts. There is not one Member of this House who does not understand how serious the issue of obtaining a mortgage has become for families. Every day, I am inundated with phone calls from constituents asking for advice or recourse when they have been unable to obtain a mortgage. Before I came into the Chamber, I was speaking to a person who was working with the same company for nearly five years, earning over €41,500 per annum plus an annual bonus of approximately €2,000 per annum, and who was paying €500 per month rent for a property that has been put up for sale for approximately €90,000.When he applied for a loan of €75,000 from the Bank of Ireland and EBS, he was refused by both. He then sought a loan from the local authority and was told his income was too high. This type of situation baffles me. Who is looking after the affairs of people in this situation? The vast majority of these people are on sustainable incomes and it beggars belief that they are being refused loans. The reason they are being refused is that there is little or no competition in this sector. A person who is refused a mortgage has few valid alternatives. As a result of this lack of competition, potential home buyers are being forced into the already crowded rental market, which is not a friendly environment for any young couple hoping to start a family. It has zero long-term certainty and landlords can charge extortionate amounts of rent. This is all due to a severe lack of competition among mortgage lenders. That said, I am pleased that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill will ensure that all mortgage holders in the State will have the protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and access to the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Minister for Finance has been quite vocal on this issue for a long time now and his recent meetings with the six main mortgage lenders have resulted in all lenders agreeing that customers should have much greater access to more competitive mortgage options. While the banks have agreed to review their rates, we must ensure they lower the standard variable rates for existing and new customers. It is only when this has been achieved that customers will get real value for money. I firmly believe that the six major lenders need to launch a strong promotional campaign to raise awareness of their best offers and how easy it is for customers to switch between lenders if they so wish. I hope all of the above steps will have been taken by the time officials from the Department of Finance meet with each of the six lenders in September to review the progress made.  This Government has already taken a number of steps to promote competition in the banking sector, including the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the creditguarantee scheme and the amendment of section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, to name but a few. I want to see this type of reform continue. We now have an excellent opportunity to push for a substantial reduction in variable rates. In my opinion, this is an opportunity that we simply cannot miss out on.

Since the Government voted down my Bill less than a month ago, the banks have given their answer. They have said a definite "No" to decreasing their standard variable rates in any real way. I recognise that Permanent TSB has moved, but Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have not budged on reducing their standard variable rates. In the case of AIB, it has made only a tiny move. The move by Permanent TSB is very much a nuanced one. It appears that those who need the cut most will be those least likely to benefit from it. The Minister set a deadline that has come and gone. Three of our four biggest banks have not budged in any real way. Meanwhile, each day four family homes are either repossessed or surrendered. Statistics from the Central Bank show that in the first quarter of 2015, 351 homes were repossessed or surrendered. I welcome Deputy McGrath's Bill, which is another genuine attempt by Members of the Opposition to deal with this issue. The core of the Bill is that the Central Bank should be allowed to declare a market failure and take action. This is a sensible approach, because there is a market failure. It is as clear as day that there is a market failure. We do not have a functioning banking system and we should not pretend that we do. I have some minor concerns about this Bill. For example, the idea that one lender can represent a market failure while others do not seems counterintuitive. Likewise, the imposition of fines as penalties presents some problems. Recent information I have received shows how reticent the Central Bank is in fining any financial institution, and that those fines, when levied, are minimal and can be passed on to the consumer. However, these are issues that can be thrashed out, in a genuine spirit of trying to reach agreement, on Committee Stage.  To put this and last month's debate into context - I have said this before but it is worth repeating - in 2011, when I challenged the Government on its failure to stand up to the banks and to pass on the ECB rate decrease at that time, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, told me: "Deputy Doherty need be in no doubt that this Government will act decisively, forcibly and effectively with the banks." There is a new Tánaiste, but the same old guff persists. As in the case of other issues such as mortgage arrears and bankers' pay, this Government is content to let the banks decide policy. The Taoiseach laments that the friendly reminder the Government gave to the banks about the deadline that has passed on mortgage rates has largely been ignored, but we are all told, "Don't worry because the Minister will follow it up." This is not a credible position. This Government is not willing to stand up to the banks. This has been proven over the past four years. As in the case of the Bill I introduced last month, this Bill introduced by Deputy McGrath seeks to empower the Central Bank to act in the interests of society and the economy. The refusal of the Government to take action, so that it is only shaking its finger at the banks, is not good enough. Sinn Féin supports this Bill. Like the Bill I introduced last month, it represents a genuine call for action and not just words. This is an issue of direct relevance to hundreds of thousands of families across this State. We do have a market failure when it comes to mortgages. Some call it a lack of competition and so on, but it is a market failure. It is becoming more and more obvious that this Government wishes to ignore the reality. Why it wishes to ignore the reality is a question of debate. One can imagine that the sale of the banks is a factor in its thinking.  As I stated last month, when we look coldly at two facts, it is inconceivable that the State would not move to use its influence at the banks it owns to make it possible to decrease rates for its citizens. It makes sense at this point of our economic development to act in the people's interest. There is no reason to delay, no reason to give more time and no reason to be satisfied with some banks indicating that they will reduce rates by the bare minimum. I fear that those of us who prioritise the welfare of society over the profit of banks are talking to the wall when it comes to this Government. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, huffed and puffed but the banks did not move. We are told there will be more meetings and that we should not worry. Given the record of this Government, I do not think the banks are trembling in their shoes or losing sleep. The banks have the measure of this Government. They have sized it up. They know this Government will not act in the interests of citizens when they say "No." All we have to do is compare this to the events of the past few days. When it comes to the mighty one-parent families, the Government has no problem moving decisively. When it comes to the courageous people who have fallen on hard times and cannot pay their debts, the Government has no problem ramming through legislation to impose attachment orders to what little money they can scrimp or save to pay off their debts. But when it comes to the banks, it is a case of taking out the kid gloves, treating them with deference and bowing to their every demand. Even with an election around the corner, the Government will not stand up to the financial institutions in the interests of citizens. We are led to believe that everything will be okay on the night. September will see another round of meetings and the Minister will huff and puff again and ask the banks to do the right thing. We own a number of the banks. The Minister for Finance holds the shares on behalf of the Irish people.It is right and fitting that the Irish people would expect, if not demand, that their Government acts in their interest instead of the interest of banks which are driven only by making profits. This, however, is a Government that is driven to see those banks make as much profit as possible on the backs of the Irish people, so that the institutions can be sold off to whichever vulture is ready to pick up the scraps. The time for posturing and delaying is over. The time for mealy-mouthed words is gone. It is time now to act on behalf of citizens. This Bill is one of a number of proposals from the Opposition to allow the Minister to bring forward legislation. It has the same purpose as the legislation the Minister indicated he may bring forward himself later this year. Why wait until then? Now is the time to act on behalf of the 300,000 people who are suffering as a result of the ultimate rip-off by the banks in respect of variable-rate mortgages.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	287	Last month, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, introduced a Bill to deal with this very issue. It is timely that we are again debating these matters just as another deadline has passed without any satisfactory move to change interest rates. The banks agreed to review their rates and products by the beginning of July, but that did not happen. Our Bill, like the one we are debating this evening, did not ask for anything too radical. It simply asked that the Government do what it said it would, namely, to act forcefully and decisively in dealing with the banks in order to protect the public, including the home owners who bailed out those banks. The Government's deeds have fallen very short of its claims. As with the Sinn Féin Bill last month, Deputy Michael McGrath's proposals represent only a small step in the right direction but would nevertheless be an important move towards making the Government's commitments a reality and helping struggling mortgage holders. The Government opposed our Bill last month and has already indicated it will take the same position on these proposals. Like the banks, this Government remains predictable in its failure to do anything meaningful to help home owners. It made clear last month that its commitments to be strong and act in the interests of the people are merely what Fine Gael and the Labour Party do at election time. In the early 2000s, Fianna Fáil engineered the property bubble and sold the public the lie that everybody could afford huge mortgages and would be fools not to avail of them. The party in government was aided and abetted by RTE, The Irish Times and the Independent Newspapers group. Fianna Fáil went on to oversee a catastrophic bank bailout, the facts of which we are only now beginning to untangle. It must be a little hard for Ministers to be lectured by Fianna Fáil, but constant references to that party's responsibility for mortgage distress and the economic trouble this country suffered in recent years does nothing for the people who are struggling to keep their homes. Many people who simply wanted a home for their family were left in dire straits, with falling incomes and massive mortgages. The banks were ripping off mortgage customers then and they continue to do so unhindered to this day by the current Government, which has been forceful in its treatment of lone parents, carers and other vulnerable groups but not with bankers. We need a firm hand to bring the banks into line and protect home owners. Sinn Féin sought to introduce that firm hand last month and by way of previous legislative proposals brought forward by Deputy Doherty, but the Government baulked at the idea. In the week when the courage of the Greek people has sent shock waves through the EU establishment, the measure of this Government's cowardice is all the more stark and embarrassing. No institution in our society has ever been better protected than the banks. Meanwhile, vulnerable sectors of our communities are regularly vilified, humiliated and insulted by a Government which has sought to remove the entitlements people have won over the years, the basic supports which keep them alive. If the Government had shown a fraction of the concern for the needs of homeless families and those in housing need as it shows for bankers' feelings, we certainly would not have more than 1,000 children in emergency accommodation tonight. We would not have an €18 million hole in funding for homeless services in Dublin city. These facts give the lie to the rubbish from Government about its commitment to tackling housing issues. It has ignored these devastating social issues and chosen instead to treat bailed out bankers as sacred cows even though they continue to ride roughshod over the people of this State. The kid gloves must come off now. We need that forceful and decisive hand in dealing with the banks. Deputy Eamon Gilmore, as former leader of the Labour Party, promised four years ago that his party in government would wield that firm hand. This Bill would be a step in the right direction. It is on the side of the home owners of Ireland, not the banks. Unfortunately, that principle is utterly absent from the actions of this Government. These proposals would introduce a legal process to allow the Financial Regulator to set a cap on the standard variable rate imposed by bailed out institutions. We have waited too long for the banks and the Government to act in favour of home owners or with any modicum of fairness in mind. The time for asking for compliance is past; it is time now to demand actions by the banks and legislate accordingly. This Bill is an extraordinary measure for the extraordinary times in which we are living. The families struggling to keep their homes are in need of such measures to ease their hardship. The banks must play their part in building a fair recovery. The opportunity was provided through the Bill we brought forward last month to do so and, prior to that, by our Interest Rates Approval Bill. If no action is taken now, even stronger measures will be needed in the future. When the Dáil rises for the summer recess next week, the struggles of families with variable-rate mortgages will continue. They cannot wait any longer for a change. They have waited for four years under this Government, paying a rate that is higher than that charged anywhere else in Europe and more than 1.4 percentage points higher than the median rate. The time to be decisive and forceful is now. This Bill should be supported, as the Bills brought forward by Sinn Féin should have been supported. Otherwise, we will be back here in September debating the same issue and no closer to a solution while families go on struggling, with no hope offered by the Government. Reference was made earlier to the prospect of the banks being sold off in the future. I offer the Government a warning in this regard. We have bailed out these banks and supported them. They belong to the people, not to the Government. There was no proper negotiation by Government when it came to the bailout, so I should not expect Ministers to talk to the banks, even though we have ownership of them. Indeed, their record in terms of negotiations is well known. Members opposite like to lecture my party on economics. I say to them that economic madness is when a debt of €88 billion ends up at more than €200 billion as a result of helping out bondholders and others.

I compliment my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on bringing forward this Bill. As the last speaker noted, Sinn Féin has tabled similar proposals, as have other Members of this House. The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, apologised for the absence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who is in Brussels. Where is the wonder man, the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris? He was proclaiming last week about how much the situation in Greece might cost us until his senior Minister, Deputy Noonan, slapped him on the wrist a few hours later and said it will cost us nothing. This Government has been in office for four and a half years and the genie is out of the bottle. Deputy Eamon Gilmore, when he was in opposition, promised, as then leader of the Labour Party, that he would burn the bondholders and sort out the banks. Hellfire would not be as hot as the fire he was going to start. Now he is going off into the sunset with his big pension. Many other members of this Government will be following him out of office, perhaps without the big pension, because the people will not put up with this. With interest rates elsewhere in Europe at 2%, mortgage holders here are paying 4%. The Government has had four and a half years to do something about this but has instead been feeble, lethargic and inept. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, was proclaimed as the man with the Midas touch who would sort it all out. He was apparently reformed since his time as Minister for Health when he oversaw the hepatitis C goings on. He was the new cool, clean Silvermint hero.He has been found out. The Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, had a cheek and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was arrogant a few weeks ago when they lectured Greece, instead of minding their business in our small nation which has always been proud to support other small nations and the ordinary people. We have now gone past that and the ordinary people no longer matter. It is all about big business. The Government promised the Central Bank consolidation Bill. It has been on the Order Paper since I was elected four and a half years ago, but it has not been introduced. There is no worthwhile legislation to deal with banks. It is a cabal and they want to do what they like. They want us to say, "Yes sir, how high sir, how much more do you want sir, screw the people as long as you like sir." It is disgusting. People can get variable rate mortgages. They are waiting for the Minister, Deputy Kelly, to change the regulations in rural Ireland, as he promised, before they build anything, and the result is that nothing is happening. It was brought to my attention some months ago that there is a Bank of Ireland branch in Clonmel which has a list of properties that were removed and are now back up again. There is a note stating that not all of them are to be sold by the bank. The people are being treated like pariahs under the Government's watch. It will be punished, and deservedly so, for the contempt it has shown, given that no Ministers came to the House, took this Bill seriously and responded to it. The Bill will be voted down and Ministers will tell their constituents they did not vote, but they have been found out. What the banks are doing is despicable. They are only interested in big business.

I am all for competition, but sadly the banks we as a nation bailed out have created cartels and are screwing the Irish public. People from all parts of the country are struggling to pay their mortgages and the cartels in the banking sector continue. It is a sad day when the Government has to intervene, but the reality is that it has to be done because AIB, EBS and other banks owned by the people have given us the two fingers. They decided to close branches in small towns and pull out in order to make their figures count, and to hell with the people who stood behind them in their hour of need. The only sector which picked up the slack in rural Ireland was the credit union sector. I have asked that the Minister give credit unions the facilities to clear cheques, do bank transfers and make sure they can function and compete with banks. When credit unions put money into banks they pay for the service, which is wrong. I urge the Minister to change that. People who currently take out new mortgages can pay 1% to 2% less than those who have been paying them for years, which is wrong. The banks have to be hauled in because they cannot get away with it. We know they can get money at a very cheap rate from the likes of the ECB. What goes around comes around. If we do not give householders a break, there will be even more than the 99,000 people currently in trouble looking for help. The banks were bailed out to the tune of €65 billion, but every Deputy has met people whom the banks have tried to evict from their houses. This is an intolerable situation that should not and cannot be allowed to continue. The Irish people did not sacrifice €65 billion for their neighbours, friends or any other Irish person with a family to be thrown out of their houses.
