#SeanSherlock	Labour	17094	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	0	The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00045/18. It is recommended that the committee will correspond with the National Disability Authority to request its observations on the petition and the responses received, and communicate with the petitioner what action has been taken. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00019/19. It is proposed that the committee forwards a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner, and then close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00021/19. It is proposed that the committee would keep the petition open and refer it to the appropriate committee for its consideration. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00029/19. It is proposed to keep this petition open, but in doing so we will refer it to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, with this committee's agreement. Is that agreed?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	1	Given that we have an issue with the number of people leaving the Defence Forces, this petition should certainly be kept open and discussed further. Perhaps the proposed extension would be a way of enticing people back in. I agree with what members are stating in this petition.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	17094	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	2	I thank the Deputy.

There is merit in what the petitioner is trying to do in keeping the age profile open. I also concur with the Chairman that it is important for the line committee to examine this issue and come back to us on it. The upper age limit for joining the Garda and the Reserve Defence Force is 35 years. It is more an issue of health, fitness and well-being, rather than age which should not be a barrier. As we got rid of the height requirement for joining An Garda Síochána, I do not see why age should be a factor either. I hope to see the petition escalated to the relevant committee.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	17094	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	4	I thank the Senator. It is agreed that we will keep the petition open. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00031/19. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Defence to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. 00032/19. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Health to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. In respect of Petition No. 00033/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?

As we are trying to move towards having a paperless society, there is merit in not issuing receipts. I understand some business people might need to keep receipts of transactions, but many shops, petrol stations and other outlets now ask customers whether they want a receipt and many people do not because it is surplus to their needs. We should encourage the Department to look at this issue and perhaps refer the petition to the line committee in order to learn how we can support measures that will reduce both paper and litter. I think there is merit in that suggestion.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	17094	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	6	The Senator has proposed referring the petition to the line committee.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	17094	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-09-25 00:00:00	Decisions on Public Petitions Received	8	That is no problem. Is the Senator making a formal proposal?

This is something we will be watching very closely.
