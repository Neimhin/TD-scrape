#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 39, inclusive, together.As regards the European Council meeting in Brussels on 21 and 22 March, the House will recall that on Tuesday, 25 March, the earliest opportunity following the Council, one hour and 20 minutes of Government time was allocated to statements on the Council, including a question and answer session. I would refer Deputies to my comprehensive statement on that occasion and the subsequent wide-ranging question and answer session. I do not wish to take up the valuable time of the House in repetition so I will not dwell too long on the Council in this reply. As I indicated  in my statement, the meeting was a productive one. We built on the work of the past three years of economic reform and recommitted all member states to achieving the European Union's ambitious ten year Lisbon strategy.We were all agreed that the current economic downturn makes it essential to increase the capacities of our economies to grow and prosper. Since we agreed the Lisbon agenda three years ago, we have made significant progress. Five million new jobs have been created in the EU. Unemployment has also declined by two million. Other areas where we have got results include opening up energy markets, creating a single European sky, putting in place an integrated Europe-wide financial market, agreeing a Union patent and an agreement on the taxation of energy. However, the European Council recognised that much more still needs to be done.Improving the employment position is central to the Lisbon strategy. In this context, the European Council invited the Commission to establish a European employment task force which will report in time for the 2004 spring European Council. I am confident that this task force will give added momentum to the employment strategy by rapidly identifying practical measures which will increase the European Union's employment levels. We also agreed that competitiveness must once again be placed centre stage and that entrepreneurship must be supported, in particular small business start-ups.On the social agenda, the European Council underlined the importance of a number of key items, including the new action plans for social inclusion, pensions and care of the elderly.International developments dominated much of the agenda of this Council. On Iraq, our shared hope was that the conflict would end with the minimum loss of human life and suffering. The EU is committed to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political stability of Iraq. We respect the right of the people of Iraq, including all persons belonging to minorities. We called on the Security Council to give the United Nations a strong mandate, particularly as regards co-ordinating assistance once the conflict in Iraq is over.We also discussed the implications of the current crisis for the Middle East region. The importance of progress in the Middle East peace process was underlined. We agreed on the importance of the immediate publication and implementation of the quartet road map which has been prepared by the UN, the US, the EU and Russia. The Council also discussed other items on the international agenda, including Cyprus, the western Balkans and Korea.I had a brief informal meeting with Prime Minster Blair en marge of the Council. I also had informal contacts with a number of other heads of government.On Wednesday, 26 March, the president of the European convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, visited Dublin. At our meeting, at which I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, we had a constructive and useful discussion on the progress of the convention. I stressed to the president Ireland's constructive and positive approach to the convention. I pointed out the active role that Ireland's representatives on the convention had played in its work. I outlined our concerns in a number of areas, in particular, that the principle of equality between member states and the overall balance between the institutions should be retained, that unanimity should be retained in the area of taxation and some elements of justice and home affairs issues.The president will brief members of the European Council on the work of the convention at an informal Council meeting prior to the signing of the accession treaty in Athens tomorrow. The question of whether a special European Council should be held in June to discuss the final report of the convention is to be decided by the Greek Presidency shortly. While not strictly a matter for the president, I reiterated my view that there should be an adequate period of reflection between the conclusion of the convention and the commencement of the intergovernmental conference. In the course of his visit, the president attended a lunch hosted in his honour by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also paid a courtesy call on President McAleese.On Tuesday, 1 April, I attended a meeting in Luxembourg of like-minded states. Also in attendance were the prime ministers of the Benelux countries, Austria, Finland and Portugal. The purpose of the meeting was to examine common principles to underpin an approach to institutional matters on which all members could agree. Our meeting found a broad range of agreement.In addition, we agreed: that the formula agreed at Nice which guarantees equality between member states should continue to apply in the appointment of the European Commission; that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament subject to modalities to be agreed – these modalities might include involvement of the national parliaments, as we have suggested; the desirability of retaining the essential elements of the system for rotation in regard to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and the European Council; that there should be double-hatting, or a single person in the High Representative and Commission External Relations post; that there should be no new institutions; that there should be a period of reflection between the final European convention report and the commencement of the intergovernmental conference; and that there should be a convention before each intergovernmental conference.A follow up meeting, to which the heads of state or government of 11 accession states have been invited, is to be held tomorrow. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I will attend that meeting.In addition, a paper co-sponsored by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, and the government representatives of 15 other countries at the convention, from both member and accession countries, was submitted to the convention. This paper set out the principles and premises that should underpin reform of the European Union's institutions. The paper was seen by the meeting as a good initiative and a positive input to the convention.On Thursday, 3 April, as part of a structured series of engagements with my European counterparts in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Union and the ongoing business of the Union, I visited Berlin for talks with Chancellor Schröder. Later that day, I travelled on to Brussels for a meeting with Prime Minister Verhofstadt. The focus of my discussions with both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor was on issues of concern regarding both European Union and international matters.I informed both leaders that the effective and efficient conduct of the Union's business is the overriding priority and focus of our preparations for our Presidency in 2004. I stated that work on the development of our Presidency programme was ongoing and that I was anxious to hear their views and to have an understanding of their concerns as we identified and developed priorities. I informed both that the Lisbon agenda would be a priority for our Presidency and I had an exchange of views with each of them on how best to advance the agenda despite the challenges of economic slowdown, global uncertainty and in the context of an enlarged Union. Progress at the European convention was a major focus for discussion with both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister.Naturally, Iraq was also discussed at both meetings. In the discussions, I expressed Ireland's deep concerns at the various threats posed by the Iraqi crisis, including the possibility of a humanitarian disaster, the risk that other countries in the region will be destabilised and the potential damage to the United Nations system arising from the disunity of its members. I indicated our readiness to assist in international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis likely to arise from a prolonged conflict. I expressed the view that it is essential to begin repairing the damage to the United Nations and that a strong, united and effective Security Council will continue to be a vital guarantor of international order in the future. I complimented Chancellor Schröder on the manner in which Germany, as chair of the relevant UN Security Council committee, had negotiated an extension to the oil for food programme.I spoke by telephone with UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in advance of the meeting in Hillsborough Castle with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. We discussed the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the role of the UN in  post-war Iraq. The Secretary General said that UN organisations and NGOs were becoming involved in the aid process in accordance with Resolution 1472. I told the Secretary General that we want to do everything within our capacity to help the people of Iraq. I also assured him that Ireland is fully committed to working with the US and its EU partners to ensure a central role for the UN in post-war Iraq.The Secretary General briefed me on his current concerns and priorities including the need for structures in post-war Iraq that will command widespread legitimacy and support. He said the issue of political facilitation leading to the emergence of a new or interim administration is an area in which the UN has considerable expertise. He felt the best way to do this would be to adhere to the Afghanistan model, co-ordinated by a UN nominee. We agreed to speak again after the Hillsborough meeting.The main focus of the discussions I had at Hillsborough Castle with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair was on Northern Ireland. The President, Prime Minister and I also had a forward-looking discussion on the situation in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. President Bush was accompanied by US Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell, Ambassador Richard Haass and national security adviser, Ms Condoleeza Rice. I had no other official contacts with any members of the United States Administration during my visit to Hillsborough.In the discussions on Iraq, I urged the President and the Prime Minister to take every possible step to avoid civilian casualties and to ensure that the utmost care would continue to be observed in this regard. I emphasised the immediate need to provide urgent treatment and care for the casualties of war.The President and the Prime Minister told me how deeply conscious they were of the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. We agreed that the humanitarian situation in Iraq must now become the immediate priority as the fighting begins to subside. I informed them that Ireland had already pledged €5 million in emergency assistance and that we are ready to contribute more according to the needs of the situation.We discussed the possible role for the United Nations in post-war Iraq. I stressed that a central UN role was necessary to give the post-war arrangements legitimacy in the eyes of the international community and Iraq's neighbours. The President indicated that he too wanted to see a role for the UN and the British and the Americans have since agreed that the UN should have a vital role. The precise nature of the role of the UN will obviously be the subject of discussion over the weeks ahead.I urged that every effort should be made to heal the divisions in the international community. This is in everyone's interests, including the coalition's. I said that it was essential to begin repairing the damage to the United Nations.The US has always appreciated the stop-over and overflight facilities at Shannon and President Bush reiterated his appreciation for these facilities.I had a further conversation with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan following the meeting at Hillsborough. I told him that I had conveyed his view on the post-war reconstruction of Iraq to the President and Prime Minister – that the UN wants to work in partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom. While there is a clear gap to be bridged, both the President and Prime Minister confirmed they were committed to a vital role for the UN in a post-war situation. I also welcomed the fact that the Secretary General would be meeting with the EU Council in Athens this week. I have now arranged a bilateral meeting with the Secretary General for tomorrow.The European Council in Athens tomorrow precedes the signing of the accession treaties for the ten new member states. The purpose of the Council is to have an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and with the Chairman of the European Convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. The meeting will consider in particular a number of questions in relation to institutional issues which have been raised by the President. These questions include how to improve the continuity and coherence in the Council, the selection and appointment of the Presidency of the Commission, the size and composition of the Commission and the appointment of the EU Foreign Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Over the coming weeks the European Convention will decide on a number of important matters regarding the institutions. Does the Taoiseach favour the appointment of a full-time president of the European Council?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We have already indicated that we can be happy if there is a president of the Commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	3	What about the Council?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Taoiseach has made a good try for extra time.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I must first listen to the Deputy's question.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	6	That is not the case. I recognise the Taoiseach's tricks.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I must first know what the Deputy says.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Taoiseach does not like short questions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I like short questions. If Deputy Quinn resumed regular attendance at Question Time he would see that matters have disimproved. At present we get through very few  questions, which is why I take so many of them together.We remain to be convinced on the need for a president of the European Union. We do not believe that the case has been made to move away from a rotating presidency. The present rotational system works well and we continue to argue for the maintenance of this system. While we are probably in a minority on this point, the matter will be raised when we meet the grouping that includes the Benelux countries early tomorrow morning. We hold the position that the existing system contains many advantages and we should not move away from it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Does the Taoiseach agree that if a full-time president was to be appointed, it would be to the detriment of the Commission? Has he or the Government formed a view on the size of the Commission and the extension of qualified majority voting and, if so, has this been communicated to the members of the convention?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	11	On the question of the size of the Commission, we are committed to what was agreed at Nice and what was voted on by the Irish people. We will not move from that position. We will take a forward-looking view on the question of qualified majority voting. While we favour its extension to a range of areas where we believe it will be effective, we have also indicated a number of areas where we do not consider it to be appropriate. These include criminal justice, justice and home affairs matters and the area of taxation. We are of the group that believes the extension of QMV will be a good thing in an enlarged Europe.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Does the Taoiseach agree that the convention has done an immense amount of valuable work? Does he also agree that in so far as its task was to relate to the ordinary citizen, it appears to have been a failure? Will he outline specific initiatives or steps he intends to take to make up this deficit in the communication of the work of the convention to the citizens of this jurisdiction?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	13	One of the purposes of the convention in the first instance was that it would simplify the treaties and present its work in a way that made it easier for individuals to understand. In fairness to the work of the convention, apart from the detailed legalistic work of the texts, I do not consider that the president or the membership have forgotten that point.The important point is what happens after 30 June and how the work of the political and other experts engaged in the work of the convention is conveyed to the wider public. The Deputy is aware that there will be a break in the proceedings of the convention, probably until October. There will then be an Intergovernmental Conference involving all the member states. In this country, the Forum on Europe and the various other European bodies have endeav oured to provide information on the work of the convention, without becoming involved in detail.I agree that the legalistic detail of the treaties and the work being produced each week by the convention is not very attractive to the ordinary citizen. The convention is endeavouring to realise the concept of making the European community work with 25 or more members to enable it to deal with EU business across member states over the next decade. The EU must be able to make decisions in a prompt fashion and communicate them across the Councils. The convention's work at this stage is not the presentational work which would make it attractive to citizens because it is far too detailed. I have made that point to the President. In fairness to him, the details in regard to justice and home affairs and under various treaty texts are not easy to communicate to the people. Neither are they particularly media-friendly. Speeches on these matters and explanations thereof do not attract much public attention.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Commission and the Council have the capacity to police the Lisbon process? Who is explicitly charged with driving the agenda and what is the particular role envisaged for Mr. Wim Kok? What role does the Taoiseach envisage in this regard for the forthcoming Irish Presidency?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Commission is the driving force. It is responsible under the Lisbon strategy for following through the original strategy of 2000 and for all of the initiatives, initiated by António Guterres, which have arisen since.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Lisbon process is followed just as well as the ten commandments and no better.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	17	That is human nature.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The process has been three years in existence and the Commission is driving it. It is producing the reports and following them up. My personal view is that there are too many initiatives in too many areas and there are too many projects which means there is not enough debate on substance other than at official level. During the Irish Presidency, I will try to take a number of initiatives from which we will attempt to get some value while not forgetting the others. The updated work will go on.What has happened in the Council over the past few years is that long debates have been taken up with the text of details with little involvement by Ministers or Prime Ministers. The follow-up will not be actively pursued either, a view shared by practically everybody. We must focus on a few areas while the ongoing work can be put in an annex report. During our Presidency, we must get agreement on the main areas and I have already begun the process of talking to  people to determine these. Obviously, the first of those is the employment and unemployment situation. A team of experts has been placed on the employment committee, an initiative of the European Council not the Commission. The Commission has decided to go along with this having initially been reluctant to see the establishment of an employment task force. Wim Kok's name was put forward by the Greek Presidency and he has been appointed with a team of experts. I spoke with him last week by telephone and he told me that he will work to bring forward new initiatives. He plans to have his report ready by the end of the year for submission to the informal employment meeting to be held here in January.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Given the wide agenda involved, is it the Taoiseach's intention to designate a particular Cabinet Minister domestically to pursue the Lisbon process? Was there mention by any party at the spring summit of the USA's intention to move from Iraq to Syria?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Both the Tánaiste and I will take the initiative through the Lisbon strategy because it is a full European Council meeting. Most of the sections and areas in the Lisbon strategy are the responsibility of the Tánaiste's Department.I do not think there is any question of activities against the Syrians other than diplomatic efforts. That was my clear impression from meetings last week.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Taoiseach referred to there being too many issues. Does he agree that taking 39 questions together certainly represents a collection of issues which, from a parliamentary point of view, is comparable to a shock and awe tactic and which makes it difficult for the Opposition to ask specific questions and do justice to all the questions grouped together?I will try to focus on a number of issues in terms of the Presidency conclusions from the March summit on which I would like more detail. One of the conclusions was that there would be accelerated progress towards compliance with the Kyoto Protocol targets. What progress does the Taoiseach see the Government making in the backdrop of Moneypoint not being transferred to gas, the cutting of incentives for wind energy by the Minister for Finance and increasing emissions from transportation? What is the Government's response to that conclusion from the summit?Does the Taoiseach see the European Union being willing merely to accept a humanitarian role for the United Nations in the Iraqi crisis or will it push for the UN to have a role in the administration of post-war Iraq?Has the Government a position on the verbal attacks on Syria by the US administration given that weapons of mass destruction have not been discovered there? Does the Government support going to war for regime change as an objective in itself? Does the Taoiseach support the calls for  the United Nations Scientific Committee to be brought in to study the effects of depleted uranium as soon as possible given the widespread use of it in the first and second Gulf wars and the health implications of that?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	22	On the Kyoto Protocol, the conclusions to the Lisbon strategy set out what everyone must live up to. We have to fulfil our targets.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	23	How?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Deputy has heard both the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, spell out what we have to do.Regarding tax incentives, there is not a completed deal yet on wind energy issues and I referred to this before. The Department of Finance is examining what it will do in this area. It has not refused, as the Deputy stated, to have incentives in this area. Different private sector interests made presentations concerning what we could usefully do to try to increase substantially the capacity of wind energy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Government cut the tax incentives.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Perhaps tax incentives will be introduced, but that is a decision yet to be made.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	27	They were cut.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Deputy Sargent should allow the Taoiseach to speak without interruption.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I am looking for answers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Other Deputies who submitted questions may wish to ask supplementary questions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The decision has yet to be made. Presentations have been made. I am not against some of these initiatives, but the aim is to generate a demand capacity under Kyoto, as some – not many – other countries have done whereby we can make it productive. The Deputy knows where the difficulty lies. It is not a viable industry without tax initiatives, not only in the Irish market but also beyond it. That is the difficulty for people who make the type of investment required, and they seek tax initiatives.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It would be viable if the Government subsidised it properly.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Deputy should look at AER VI.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I want to get accurate answers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	35	If Deputy Sargent does not cease interrupting I will have to ask him to leave the House. Other Deputies who submitted questions are entitled to submit a supplementary question to the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On Deputy Sargent's second question on Iraq, Ireland's position is the EU position, which is that the UN, with its expertise and experience in this area, should become actively involved at as early a date as possible and should participate fully in partnership with the UK and the US in dealing with the issue.What was the Deputy's third question?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Does the Taoiseach support the call for the scientific committee of the UN to go to Iraq to investigate the effects of depleted uranium?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I am not sure that question arises from the 39 questions submitted.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Everything else arises.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	40	It certainly does not arise in respect of the humanitarian issues.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	41	What is the Taoiseach's considered view of the draft constitution produced by the Convention on the Future of Europe? He has been reluctant to share that view with us in the past and I hope he will do so now. Will he confirm the report that there will be a special summit on or about 30 June to discuss the draft? Will he confirm that this House will have the opportunity to have a full debate before the summit? Does the Taoiseach agree that the proposed constitution paves the way for a fully fledged United States of Europe and that this is anti-democratic in that it will move decision making and accountability ever further from the citizens for whom national Parliament and national responsibility at Government level will be subsumed or placed into a second tier?What is the Taoiseach's view of the very worrying proposals to abolish the unanimity requirement in respect of justice and home affairs matters and in foreign and security policy?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On Deputy Ó Caoláin's first question, the discussion on the constitution is ongoing and I hope it will be finished by 30 June. The Irish representatives from both Parliament and Government have submitted papers on various aspects of it throughout the ongoing discussions. Amendments are produced on each section of the Articles as they are presented. The end game has not yet arrived in respect of any of these areas and it is far too early to offer a final view. As I have said already, I have no difficulty with having a debate in the House before 30 June and I would welcome it. It is taking place in the committee.In reply to the question about the details, the formula agreed at Nice guarantees equality  between member states who continue to apply, in the appointment of the European Commission and that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament subject to agreed modalities. This has still to be worked out and it must include the involvement of national Parliaments. That is our proposal and it is debatable whether this will be finally agreed. We are in favour of the double hatting of the position of high representative and the Commission external relations post. We are not in favour of new institutions. We believe there should be a period of reflection, a break from 30 June into the autumn and the length of this break is open to discussion. As I said to Deputy Kenny, I feel it should be until some time in late October.We are obviously in favour of the Community method and of keeping the Commission as strong as possible because we believe in its right of initiative and that the role it plays is extremely important to all countries, particularly small countries.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle to have a conversation with the Taoiseach about the taking of this huge block of questions. There are 26 questions on European affairs and 13 on the Taoiseach's meetings with the leaders of Britain and the United States regarding Iraq. These should have been blocked separately to allow us the time to ask adequate supplementaries.I refer specifically to Questions Nos. 29 and 30. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair justified their criminal invasion of Iraq by saying its purpose was to disarm Iraq because it had weapons of mass destruction and was a direct threat to the United States and Britain. Did the Taoiseach, in his discussions with the two men at Hillsborough, seek an explanation for the massive contradiction that the army of the state that allegedly held weapons of mass destruction and was a such a threat was responsible for the death of 100 US and British soldiers, whereas the states that were under threat killed countless thousands of innocent civilians and conscripts? Did he point out that no chemicals or poison gas were used? Did this strike the Taoiseach as a massive contradiction? If he did not know about the background to this war, who would he say held the weapons of mass destruction?Did the Taoiseach raise with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair the suspicion of many people on this island that they lied about their reasons for the invasion? Can I ask further—

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Does the Taoiseach believe that the reasons put forward for the invasion were fraudulent through and through? Finally, did he discuss with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair what their intention is in the Middle East now that phase one – I stress phase one -of the Iraqi war is winding down, particularly in view of their arrogant posturing, threatening sanctions, with regard to Syria in recent days? We know that what starts with sanctions finishes up with invasions. Did the Taoiseach express any unease about this with the President and the Prime Minister or is he prepared to trot along behind them as they move into other states, in the same way as President Bush thanked him for assisting the invasion of Iraq?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	50	During Leaders' Questions on two different days last week, I outlined the issues I raised and discussions I had with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. I raised most of the issues surrounding the invasion and what was the position at that time. We must wait until the end of the conflict to see what weapons of mass destruction are found, what reports are made and what surrendering Iraqi scientists and others have to say. I am not in a position to give those answers now. I do not think anybody is until we see a full report—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	52	In relation to Syria, Iran and other locations, the issue breaks down into two replies. There have been no indications in my discussions with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair of any intention to attack Syria or Iran. Quite the contrary. The situation in Iraq evolved over a long and sustained period because of the non-fulfilment of UN resolutions over a 12-year period. US differences with Syria and Iran may give rise to concern but they almost certainly have to be addressed in a diplomatic way, and I have not heard, from the EU or elsewhere, of any reason not to believe that such issues can be handled through peaceful, diplomatic means.On the other side of the Middle East issue, President Bush has changed his policy line substantially on the Palestinian-Israeli question. We have had statements from Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, which will hopefully be followed through in an effort to make progress and bring the peace process in Israel and Palestine back to the position it was in a few years ago.Finally, President Bush did not thank me for helping the United States with the invasion of Iraq—

Would he cease to be a Commissioner as well? What would happen if, in turn, the Commission lost the confidence of the Parliament and had to resign? Would he cease to be representative of the Council in that situation? In other words, if he loses one hat, does he lose both?

Weapons of destruction were not the only justification and were not the stated justification in the 16 resolutions which were passed prior to the attack. The world was made believe that the Saddam Hussein regime had weapons of mass destruction. We all believed that to be the case and that somewhere along the line that would be—

Although they were against the war, they made considerable efforts. The Deputy will have heard Gerhard Schröder make those statements in the  past week. Perhaps that assisted. I do not know to whom they talked but they certainly tried to deal with that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I cannot answer for the United States.In regard to double hatting, having been through all the arguments, it makes sense to have one person in this position. Obviously, if that person loses status and is acting as a Commissioner, I do not see how he can hold on to one position and not the other. This question has already been put. If one is in a doubled hatted position and one loses control or status, I do not see how one could hold on to one position over another.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	68	If that is the case, does that not undermine entirely the collective responsibility and independence of the Commission in that if a Commissioner, who also happens to be a foreign minister of the Council, must resign as a Commissioner because he has lost the confidence of the Council, we are then in a situation where one Commissioner out of whatever number there are can be dismissed by the Council whereas the rest can be dismissed in another way. Does that not fundamentally undermine both the separation of powers and the separate accountability of the two institutions in a way which could ultimately corrode the entire Community method?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	69	This has been debated and I have heard the various arguments. Deputy Bruton has asked me a fair question. If the position is double hatted and the individual loses the confidence of the Commission or the Council, I could not see the individual being able to lose one position on the basis of losing confidence. Let us say the European Parliament decided that a Commissioner or the President of the Commission was to lose this position but was to hold on to his status. I cannot visualise how an individual who had lost power or the respect and authority as a result of a decision by the Parliament could continue to fulfil that role. I cannot see how it is visualised. Deputy Bruton knows that I have said this in the debate already.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	72	May I ask the Taoiseach about the one Government proposal of which I am aware, the establishment of an electoral college to somehow select the President of the European Commission on a 50-50 basis? Will the Taoiseach outline the developmental work that is ongoing in that regard? How would candidates emerge under the system proposed by the Government? Where would the threshold of eligibility be fixed? Would there be a process of nominations? How  would the election happen? How would the combination of domestic Parliaments and the European Parliament work?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I will gladly make available to Deputy Rabbitte a presentation on this particular aspect or the full range of initiatives. Several initiatives have been made by the Government and its representatives, but I assume Deputy Rabbitte is talking about the Government's initiative. The concept behind the initiative mentioned by the Deputy is that institutions other than the European Parliament should have a say. The Deputy's earlier question related to the need to demonstrate that there is a link between appointments and national Parliaments and to ensure that the European Parliament and individual Parliaments have a role in making decisions on the same day. The Government's proposal is not the majority position at present, despite the fact that it deals successfully with the need to bring decision-making closer to the people.The number of parliamentarians to be involved would have to be selected. The Government's paper makes suggestions in that regard – it suggests that 50% should be from the European Parliament and 50% should be from national Parliaments. The number of members of each national Parliament who will vote in the election of the President of the Commission will be based on the size of the country. The proposed system has the benefit of involving local Parliaments. Those who oppose the concept believe it is too cumbersome and that MEPs are already national Parliamentary representatives. They ask why members of the national Parliaments should be involved. The answer to such a question, which relates to the point made by the Deputy at the outset and which may be uncharitable, is that European public opinion is that national Parliaments are closer to the people and that if people could vote, they would feel more involved. That is why I like the idea. I have to be frank by saying that this matter is up for discussion with the Benelux group and ourselves tomorrow morning. I think there is merit to the idea and I will pursue it tomorrow.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The last thing we would like is for this to become a group issue. It would be far better if people of status and people who are qualified from the Parliament would come forward, rather than it just being a block vote. That would be wrong. I said earlier that the modalities of the arrangements for the election of the President of the Commission should not be on the basis of a block vote, or one side against another. The modalities must be agreed. Everybody agrees that we should not have a fixed vote, where it comes from one side or another in the Parliament. I do not think there is a difficulty in that. The value of the Government's proposal is that the election of the President of the Commission will not be just a remote European Parliament decision, as important as it is. The involvement of the national Parliaments would be a good thing.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The alternative energy requirement programme generally supports new renewable energy based electricity generating stations by allowing developers to enter into guaranteed demand contracts with the ESB for up to 15 years.The guaranteed revenue streams are sufficient to allow developers to negotiate acceptable terms with debt and equity providers. AER VI aims to complete the current Government target to add  500 megawatts from previously supported technologies by 2005. A further 78 megawatts will be supported for the first time in offshore wind and biomass combined heat and power categories. I took account of the views of the sector in developing the terms and conditions of AER VI resulting in a more favourable approach to indexation of the contract price and an optional front-loading of part of the cash flow.Last Thursday, I attended the annual conference of the Irish Wind Energy Association and the clear message to me regarding AER VI was that the terms and conditions are sufficient and if I am to change anything I should increase the capacity limits. This reflects significant confidence by developers in the competition. I am confident therefore that the terms and conditions which I have set for the competition are sufficient to ensure that the current target of 500 megawatts is met on time and that the offshore and biomass-CHP options can be properly evaluated.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I was at the same wind energy conference and perhaps the Minister did not stay long enough but certainly there are more problems with AER VI than he seems to recognise. Why is the Minister so confident that the target figure of 500 megawatts will be created by AER VI? When one examines the history of both AER V and AER III, for example, not a single renewable energy project has been built under AER V and less than 35% of projects that were granted contracts under AER III were built. Will the Minister agree that if he is serious about achieving 500 megawatts surely it makes sense to offer significantly more contracts? This is in anticipation that at least a reasonable percentage of the consortia that get contracts will not proceed for various reasons, whether planning permission reasons to do with the connection of power lines to the national grid or financial reasons.Why did the Minister choose to introduce such low price cap figures under AER VI? A comparison with other European countries shows that in Scotland the price cap figure is 30% to 40% higher than in Ireland, Spain has a figure which is 20% or 30% higher and both Germany and France have significantly higher figures. Will the Minister agree that all the countries that have made significant progress have significantly higher price cap figures for the support systems for renewable energy? What makes the Minister so confident that AER VI will succeed when it seems clear that the price cap figure is too low and the number of contracts that he will allocate is also too low for the targets he has set?

The Government cannot be castigated by commentators for increasing electricity prices and at the same time endeavouring to introduce renewable energy. There has to be a balance. The Deputy spoke about the difference between AER VI and the previous AER projects. From the many contacts I have had with the renewable energy sector and the wind energy sector in particular—
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Minister was not listening.

The Deputy may remember that at the conference they spoke about a potential bloodbath in relation to those companies and individuals who wish to be considered under AER VI. The Deputy knows that at the conference I went further when I said that I would not wait around for a considerable time before endeavouring to put in place an alternative or a new system if that is required to follow on from AER VI. I indicated that a consultation process would be set up in the very near future. I like to think that Fine Gael might even make some representations to that consultation process. Fine Gael called for consultation but it did not make a submission on intoxicating liquor. It has been making a lot of noise in recent times.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	105	As the Deputy will be aware, my responsibility lies in developing and implementing public policy that ensures that broadband services are widely available at affordable prices in the Irish market, whether such services are provided for citizens, schools or the business community. There have been a number of significant developments recently which should lead to the realisation of this policy. My Department has co-funded private sector investment in telecommunications infrastructure and services. There has been development of open access metropolitan area networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. My Department is exploring the potential of satellite and wireless-based technologies. FRIACO will be mandated before the end of June 2003.With regard to the delivery of e-education services to students and schools, the Deputy will be aware that this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. I understand that the Minister for Education and Science has engaged consultants to review the options for delivery of broadband services to primary and secondary schools. The terms of reference for the consultancy study are available from the Department of Education and Science. This study will be completed by mid-2003 and will conclude with recommendations for broadband connectivity to all schools, an implementation plan and a draft tender document which may form the basis of an approach to market in light of available funding. My Department is represented on the steering committee for this consultancy with the Department of Education and Science and the National Centre for Technology in Education.In addition, my Department is actively considering a number of innovative methods of providing the resources for connectivity to schools in light of the consultants' recommendations. One possibility is a flexible public service levy designed to provide funds required for investment in educational connectivity as well as a number of other areas of importance. I have asked my officials to examine this issue with a view to proposals being brought to Government in this regard.I met the chief executive of ESB and the chief executive of ESB Telecoms on the issue of a proposal for the use of power line technology to bring broadband to schools in remote areas. This  technology provides broadband connectivity through existing power lines and could be suitable for use in remote areas. I will shortly announce details of a pilot project in this area. My Department is supporting wireless LAN projects and I launched such a project yesterday in my constituency. This will provide a solution to the problem of restricted broadband connectivity in remote areas.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I acknowledge that the primary responsibility rests with the Minister for Education and Science and that a programme for the provision of IT began after the 1997 general election. Over the past two and a half to three years, primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland have embarked on a radical programme of broadband infrastructure for all the children of Northern Ireland. They are all to be given an e-mail address, hands-on access and perhaps home access. Is it not true that as usual, we are left at the starting gate and the Minister and his Department are trying to catch up on what his predecessor did not do in the four or five years before?This is a crucial area and the Minister must address it in the period of his tenure of office. Is it not the case that a two-tier society is being created? Better off children in highly resourced schools, from highly resourced homes, will be on-line, have access to broadband and know about the Internet and its capabilities. Children from disadvantaged areas will be left with no resources or facilities. The Government is creating a two-tier society in terms of e-exclusion. Will the Minister agree that a recent survey by Amárach Consulting proved that half A, B, C1 category households are on-line, whereas 20% of C2, D and E category households are on-line? This is already creating a two-tier society in another direction, which indicates another hopeless failure for the Government.The Minister should have had the national vision of Seán Lemass or Éamon de Valera 60 or 70 years ago, to ensure that every household, no matter what its income or resources, would have continuous on-line access. The approach of the Department is ludicrous, half-baked and completely hopeless in relation to children.

He then though it was a great idea. There is more to opposition than simply responding to commercially driven inserts in newspapers. I warn him to be somewhat careful about taking a lead from quotations from industry representatives who are endeavouring to force a situation where they will gain from a profit point of view. I am surprised that someone from the Labour Party is taking a lead from the private sector which clearly has a vested interest in what it is suggesting.

While I do not have direct responsibility in this regard, I have gone through the process of getting some information for the Deputy on what the Department of Education and Science has done.The Department of Education and Science has to date invested more than €140 million in the integration of ICTs into teaching and learning at first and second level. There are two phases. The first phase, school IT 2000, ran from 1998 to 2000 and concentrated on the provision of computer equipment at school level – basic and advanced ICT. I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge there have been good strides in this regard and I agree it is vital to ensure there is not a two-tier society. There are ongoing discussions between the Ministers for Education and Science and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Éamon Ó Cuív, and me in this regard. No Minister of any political hue has been more active than I have been in recent months in bringing forward Internet access. As one can see from recent developments, there has been significant progress in bringing forward FRIACO and cheaper DSL.

Wireless LAN is one of the most significant proposals in that respect, which works. I saw it demonstrated yesterday in my own county. While I accept it is not a remote area, the technology can be used in remote areas. There is also the issue of satellite, which provides significant broadband connectivity. Perhaps the Deputy was not listening when I referred to the other pilot project we are considering. We have had discussions with the ESB in regard to using the power lines. This is being done on a pilot basis in two other European countries, and we are following on from that. I assure the Deputy that we are leaving no stone unturned.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	115	My Department has an ongoing safety programme involving an appropriate combination of statutory regulation, enforcement and safety awareness promotion with the aim of achieving the highest level of safety at sea and on inland waters. In August last I initiated a review of safety measures on small watercraft. This review is focusing on the requirement to carry and wear lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased safety awareness. I brought forward the date for implementation of new safety regulations applicable to passenger boats from June to January 2003. A number of seminars were organised around the country to promote the new regulations.My Department issued a consultation paper last November seeking views on the adequacy of existing legislation regarding the carrying and wearing of lifejackets. More than 100 lengthy submissions have been received and these are currently being assessed.As regards Ireland's port State control obligations under Directive 95/21/EC, following a redeployment of resources in the latter half of 2002 when we took on ten extra marine surveyors, my Department achieved an improved inspection performance from 21% in 2001 to 30% in 2002. This is above the 25% inspection ratio requirement under the directive and improves the safety standards of ships using our ports. A further ten vessel surveyors were also recruited recently to ensure that we continue to meet our port State control obligations.The Maritime Safety Directorate's business plan for 2003 includes an ambitious legislative programme involving new regulations governing domestic passenger ships, fishing vessels, port State control regime and measures to monitor the activities of classification societies that conduct survey inspections on behalf of flag states. The Deputy can be assured that the safety on our waters is a priority for me and my Department in the coming months.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the final statement by the Minister and the fact that we have improved significantly our inspection figures of ships coming into Irish ports. It was not before time or before we were embarrassed into doing so by the EU. I am sure the Minister is aware that an average of 85 people are lost each year as a result of accidental drowning. Some 42% of these people drown at sea and approximately 58% on inland waterways.I am sure he will agree that the key to improving these tragic figures is to educate people as to the dangers of the sea and inland waterways. In  that regard, will the Minister confirm that aquatics is now to be part of the physical education curriculum in all primary schools? This has been semi-announced and, even though the Minister does not have direct responsibility for education, he would be aware of the proposal if it were the case. It would be helpful if he could confirm the proposal and confirm that the Department of Education and Science will pay for the training as opposed to parents of children in primary school.In regard to enforcement, will the Minister tell the House how many people have been prosecuted for not carrying lifejackets on vessels since the legislation was introduced and how many have been arrested for the abuse of alcohol or drugs while in charge of a mechanically propelled vessel?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Given the broad range of the question, I do not have the information on the last two questions. Perhaps the Deputy will put down a parliamentary question and we will get him the information.In regard to the issue of safety, I thank the Deputy for what he said. This has been a priority for me since coming into office. On the issue of aquatics as a subject to be included in the primary school curriculum, I am aware that some discussions have taken place. I am not sure because this area is not my responsibility. It is an area to which I have given much thought. As the Deputy will be aware from the submissions in regard to compulsory wearing or availability of lifejackets, it is not that simple. Already, some of the submissions from people in this sector point out that one cannot wear a lifejacket on all occasions.There are issues that need to be addressed. We cannot be overly prescriptive and I agree completely with the Deputy that education is the ultimate way to encourage people to wear lifejackets. Unfortunately, despite wide-ranging and expensive publicity campaigns by various agencies the figures the Deputy related still exist. While we must continue to increase the level of education, there must be an element of the carrot as well as the stick. We should tighten up the regulations and the enforcement of them.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I have received feedback regarding the lifejacket questionnaire that says it was issued at an unsuitable time of the year. People were only given three weeks to respond and the document remains on the desks of a significant number of people that did not have an opportunity to respond to it before the end of December last. If it is the case that conclusions have not been reached on recommendations for wearing lifejackets, I suggest that people be given a second opportunity to make submissions.Does the Minister think it is acceptable that the Galway based Irish Water Safety Council relies so heavily on fund-raising to spread its message to schools and community groups etc.? Will the Minister consider looking at the funding available  to this agency? While the agency does excellent work, it is grossly underfunded. If it is true to say the Minister has made the improvement of water safety a priority and seeks to change the mind-set of people towards it, surely the proper financing of the water safety council is the place to start.

One might say it was issued at the wrong time of the year, yet if we were to issue the consultation paper in the summer the people involved in the leisure sector may well be on their boats.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	122	BSkyB is regulated in relation to broadcasting content under the TV without frontiers directive, which provides that broadcasters are subject to such regulation in one country only. As BSkyB's headquarters is in Britain, it is subject to content regulation in that state.The new EU regulatory package on electronic communication networks, services and associated facilities must be transposed into national law by 25 July 2003. The regulation of content is specifically excluded from the scope of the directives implementing that regulatory package and thus the transposing regulations will not result in BSkyB, or other providers of television services, being subject to regulation on broadcasting content in this State. In the context of the transposition into Irish law of the European regulatory package, the extent to which the package applies to other aspects of the provision of television services in the State by satellite as well as other platforms arises. Such aspects include access to facilities, quality of service and consumer protection.If it emerges that the new regulatory package does not allow for the regulation of those aspects of television service provision in Ireland, I will consider additional legislation to address those other aspects. This stance is in line with the policy direction I issued to the CCR earlier this year, instructing the Commission to provide consistency across platforms in terms of regulation. In  this direction I mandated the CCR to: ensure that regulatory obligations imposed upon undertakings engaged in the provision of similar electronic communications services but using different technologies are consistent, taking into account any different conditions that may exist, including the existence of market power. In issuing this direction I have mandated the CCR to ensure that a level playing field exists across platforms and this includes satellite. My Department is currently in discussion with the CCR on this issue and where new legislation is required and is consistent with the EU framework it will be provided.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Throughout the term of his Administration, the Minister has spoken of his desire to bring Sky under regulation. It used to be said that the Minister's party feared "the belt of a crozier". Is it not the case now that it is extremely afraid of a scowl on the face of Rupert Murdoch? Why are we discussing the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill this evening? Why was it left in limbo for two and a half years? There clearly was an agenda at work.I note that yesterday, this organisation has taken over DIRECTV, the largest satellite provider in the US and it has FOXTEL in Australia and STAR TV in Asia. It is a huge global network. Does the Minister agree that it is extremely unfair on providers like Chorus and NTL and the telecoms companies that levies are placed on them but not on BSkyB? There is a levy of 0.2% to 3.5% on the turnover of cable and telecoms companies to help run ComReg, yet there is no levy on satellite operators, particularly this massive operator that has been filling our screens in recent weeks.Five or six months ago, the Minister said he was considering the introduction of broadcasting spectrum fees and would not hesitate to apply them to BSkyB as well as all other operators. Why are we still waiting for this? Is the Minister afraid?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I wonder if the Deputy berating Sky will watch it tomorrow night to see his beloved soccer team play Arsenal. I have already said in response to previous parliamentary questions that there are five directives to be transposed into Irish law by 25 July 2003. Ireland is one of only a number of states that will transpose them on time. These will give the CCR greater additional powers in this area. It is wrong of the Deputy to suggest, and naïve of people to think, that this is purely an Irish problem. It is an EU-wide, if not world-wide problem. This is one of the reasons a review of the directive is taking place to establish what else can be done to ensure fairness of treatment. One of the net results of the transposition of the five directives will be the levelling of the pitch for other service providers. I accept that is a circumstance that exists and it is something in which we are endeavouring to at least assist other providers.If I am lucky enough to be in the position when Ireland assumes the presidency of the EU, the broadcasting issue will be on my agenda and I hope to bring finality to the review of the television without frontiers directives.There is no agenda such as that suggested by the Deputy. The fact that I have taken on Sky and the FAI defeats any argument that he may make that the Government, or I are afraid of a "belt of a crozier" from Rupert Murdoch or anyone else.

We will await the directives. As of now the Minister has no intention of regulating BSkyB in the State in relation to the cost of COMREG, spectrum fees or content. The Minister will recall that BCI made a presentation recently in relation to advertisements aimed at children which everyone in the House was anxious would proceed. In other words, the Minister is saying we have no control in that area.

In order to repair the vessel it was necessary to remove the cargo, and this operation has now been completed. These operations took place under the control of the Irish Coast Guard.Temporary repairs were initially carried out on the vessel and were completed in a few days.  The tanker was then moved to dry dock where permanent repairs were undertaken.In relation to costs, my Department pursues "the polluter pays" principle. The Irish Coast Guard has assessed the cost of its services during the incident at €213,000 and discussions are under way with the ship's owners at this time for the recovery of this sum.

I welcome the news on the recovery of funding and I hope that happens. What staff resources are available to the Maritime Safety Directorate? I am aware the Minister had intended to increase the number of inspectors significantly. Is the Minister disappointed the ban on single hulled vessels going through our waters will not come into operation until 2010. We will have to endure these battered old worthless hulks ploughing up and down our seas for another few years and possibly causing a major environmental disaster. I convey my congratulations to all the agencies involved.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks. A tremendous operation was carried out. One has only to look at the response in some of the magazines, Lloyds List compared Ireland's handling of the Princess Eva with the handling of the Prestige. The way in which all our agencies worked in consort and in partnership ensured a safe and successful pollution free incident. I raised the issue at a recent Maritime Transport Council meeting to indicate how vulnerable to these events we all are on the west coast of Europe. A detailed discussion took place on the phasing out of single hull tankers. We have to be conscious that there is a substantial number of these still in operation. The Greeks, who have the Presidency, made a strong case for the single hull tankers because from their point of view it would be impossible for them to deliver oil to the various islands which are part of its nation's state. There are many difficult issues to be dealt with. To be fair to the Greeks, they acceded to the phasing out of the single hull tankers by 2008.

This is an issue  that will have to go to the IMO. Once Ireland, France, Portugal and Spain made this proposal, all the other countries who have maritime waters wished to have their areas included. This matter is being discussed currently. Last week officials of my Department were in Paris to discuss this issue.

Had it gone slightly worse, I was concerned that our stocks in the Killybegs depot for the control of such instances seemed to be limited, particularly the length of boom that could be used to trap oil in a particular place. Has the Minister any views on that matter? It seemed to me that the length of boom available was quite short. Is he happy with the facilities we have in such stored depots or do they need to be revised?

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	140	As I stated in reply to similar questions on 29 January and 4 March there is justification for optimism in 2003 about petroleum exploration offshore Ireland. Much of the Atlantic Margin of our offshore is either untested or under explored and every effort is being made to promote the exploration of these areas.These efforts face considerable obstacles.  Unfortunately, the past 12 months have seen a very steep decline in exploration activity in North West Europe. In Ireland there are now only seven offshore exploration licences in place – down from a peak of 32 five years ago. In addition western offshore areas are difficult to access and explore, in terms of water depth, distance from land and lack of infrastructure. These define both the difficulties and the challenge that face both the Government and the industry.Last November I launched the Porcupine Licensing Initiative. Its purpose is to re-open the Porcupine Region, closed since 1999, for exploration. The region will be opened for licensing in four tranches as it covers a large area, 241 full blocks. Some wells have been drilled there in the past but it still has real exploration potential. Regrettably there were no applications in relation to the first tranche which had a closing date of 15 March 2003.The results from the Dooish well which was drilled off Donegal last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland also gives grounds for optimism. The company will carry out further appraisal of the well this year. My Department has long held that there was "real" exploration potential within these frontier areas and these results further vindicate this view. It is also likely that a further exploration well will be drilled in the Slyne-Erris Basin in 2003 under a licence commitmentWithin the past 16 months, two petroleum leases, for the Corrib Gas Field and the Seven Heads Gas Accumulation, have been signed. Production from Seven Heads is set to commence later this year and production from Corrib will depend on the outcome of the planning appeal which is at present being determined by An Bord Pleanála. In addition, there will be a small satellite development, South West Kinsale Greensand, in the Kinsale gas field. This is directed at accessing gas reserves that were not being drained effectively by the existing Kinsale gas field wells. The target date for gas production is July 2003.In summary, there will be six development wells drilled in 2003, one exploration well, one appraisal well and one production well.

Besides external factors and the world prices for oil and gas, what factors led to the catastrophic decline in the number of exploration licences in the past four or five years? The Minister of State has hinted several times in recent months that the Dooish well may turn out to be an extremely valuable discovery, if it does not turn us into Norwegians or Saudi Arabians. Is the situation as hopeful as he has hinted? What is the timeframe, if the planning procedure is over, for Corrib to come on stream and what flows are expected from it?
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Companies worldwide are reluctant to get involved in gas and oil exploration at  present. With regard to Dooish, one is always hopeful. Drilling is set to commence on 1 May with the deep water rig, Jack Bates, and we will continue to monitor the situation. Since the full appraisal has not been carried out, we are not in a position to say how fruitful it will be.With regard to the Corrib field, I hope the decision by An Bord Pleanála will be arrived at by the end of this month. If the decision is positive, work will commence immediately and the target for delivery of the first gas remains mid-2005.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The meeting with representatives of the north-west fishing industry on 7 March was positive and productive. The discussions concentrated on how best to develop a viable alternative to the fishing effort limitation scheme agreed at last December's Council. As the Deputy will recall, I opposed this approach at the December Fisheries Council on the basis that the application of days at sea restrictions was not the appropriate mechanism for the recovery of cod stocks and would severely impact on the economies of coastal fishing communities.It was agreed at the 7 March meeting that a prerequisite to the development of a viable alternative cod recovery strategy was the collection of additional scientific data on the state of the cod stock off the Donegal coast and especially the fishery off Greencastle. Following the meeting, I  asked the Marine Institute to proceed immediately with a study costing over €300,000 into cod stocks off the coast of Donegal. This study, which is supported by EU funding, will involve the evaluation of the benefits of a seasonal closure of the Greencastle codling fishery and will be led by the Marine Institute with input from the Donegal fishing industry and BIM.This project will increase our knowledge of the cod stock in the area and I am confident that it will in turn enable more appropriate and specific technical conservation measures to be devised. I will be seeking to have such targeted measures incorporated into a long-term recovery plan for that cod stock with a view to replacing the blunt instrument of the days at sea approach.The meeting also considered that there may be possibilities for diversification for fishermen affected by these new restrictions. In particular, this may involve the use of alternative fishing methods and gears, and I have asked BIM to explore such possibilities with individual fishermen.

In particular, has the Department figures showing the impact of the rule on smaller fishing boats, where the major impact was expected? Has the Minister proposals on the likely loss of earnings by Donegal fishermen and a financial package, which the Killybegs fishermen's organisation and the Irish Fish Producers Organisation asked him to investigate?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	149	On the particular instrument which lays down the days at sea limitation, we have had extensive discussions with the industry and with the people affected. Depending on the type of mesh size used, a number of boats which it was thought might be affected will not be, provided they have a particular mesh size. Boats will be permitted to fish for 25 days, 23 days or 15 days, depending on the mesh size used. The number of boats involved is relatively small but I accept that the rule will have implications for people onshore and offshore. That formed part of the discussions we had at the recent meeting. Following from that meeting, BIM and the Marine Institute have been involved in seeing what assistance and alternatives could be operated.At the most recent meeting we endeavoured to have the days at sea rule changed. A number of countries, for different reasons, were also against it. Denmark and France, particularly, voted with us against the amended proposal but for different reasons. Unfortunately, the UK did not. Despite the brouhaha in Scotland, the UK still insisted on the days at sea limitation which, obviously, meant that any amendment we proposed could not be included.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Will the Minister elaborate  on how mesh size affects whether boats would have to reduce their days at sea? Would the rule affect larger or smaller boats? The Minister said the vast majority of boats would not have to apply for the nine day licence? Did the rule fall particularly on any area? Will the Minister briefly outline what other technical measures he believes could bring about the conservation that the Fischler proposals seek?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	151	On mesh size, we issued an advisory note to fishermen to explain exactly how it would apply. Trawlers with towing gear, except beam trawlers, and with a mesh size over 100 mm are restricted to 11 days. For a mesh size of 70 mm to 99 mm the limitation is 25 days. When we checked the log books of some of the boats involved in that area and examined the history of what they had been using we found that many of them would be able to fish for 25 days under the existing regulations. To a certain extent, therefore, there was an alleviation because of the interpretation of the EU directive. We are working with the Commission and will continue to do so in relation to alternatives that might be put in place. The Deputy may be assured that the Commission is taking a very tough line on the issue of the recovery of cod and hake in our waters.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Generally speaking, the larger boats which were able to go out into the deeper water were not affected by the restriction on days at sea because quite a small sliver of water was included in this proposal. It tended to be the smaller boats that were affected, but even those smaller boats can, in many cases, continue with the type of fishing they have done up to now and have 25 days at sea. Those that had over 200 mm mesh would, in effect, be able to change to a different mesh and thereby come under the 25 day rule.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I arranged to meet Commissioner Fischler on 12 March to discuss with him, at first hand, a number of marine issues of particular interest to Ireland. The primary focus of our discussion was in relation to the Irish box. However, we also ranged over other issues such as current progress on the development of long-term recovery plans for cod and hake stocks and also the new fishing effort limitation scheme in  operation off the north-west coast since the beginning of February.In so far as the Irish box is concerned, I again emphasised to Commissioner Fischler the biological sensitivity of fishing grounds within the box on which Irish fishermen are highly dependent. I also reiterated to the Commissioner the importance of preventing an increase of fishing effort within the Irish box. A migration of fishing effort into the Irish box would be inconsistent with the overriding need to conserve stocks and in that regard I stressed the particular need to maintain an equilibrium between fleets and stocks.The Commissioner accepted my view that this is a vital issue that needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency. He also accepted that a Union approach must be followed in this case and that a bilateral approach would not result in a resolution of the current situation. As I have previously advised the House, the existing Commission proposal is completely unacceptable and must be radically amended. In that regard, I advise the Deputy that the Commissioner undertook at our meeting to reflect further on how this matter can be resolved.On the basis of recent soundings, it is clear that Ireland's position and concerns are not being satisfactorily addressed in current Commission thinking on a possible compromise. Accordingly, I again spoke at length with Commissioner Fischler last week to reiterate my concerns and press Ireland's case. I have agreed a further meeting with Commissioner Fischler in light of the lack of progress on this critical issue.

Will the Minister give us information as to the impact the new situation in relation to the box has made since 1 January? Is the 40-boat rule being adhered to by our Naval Service and Coastguard? The Minister said that clearly this situation must be resolved. Is there a timeframe for resolving it? The Minister threatened previously to go to the European Court. Is this something he is still thinking about or is that much further down the line?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The Government has had significant discussions on this matter and we are looking at every option. There is one thing which, to a certain extent, has weakened my position. Going into the new year, Armageddon was being forecast not only by the Opposition but by people outside this House. However, the number of boats within the Irish box has been surprisingly small. On the day of my recent meeting with Commissioner Fischler there were only five in the box. Today, before I came into the House, there were 18 in the box, and most of those are in the north-west, not in the south-west. We are keeping a close eye on this issue, on which we hold very strong views. We were successful in getting the  Commission to move away from a position where it treated this as a bilateral issue between ourselves and Spain to a position where it is dealing with it on a Union basis, which is necessary because other countries such as the UK, France and Portugal are also affected.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Minister said he holds strong views on the issue of the Irish box. Will he reassure fishermen around the country that if more than the 40 Spanish vessels that are allowed into the Irish box come into it, we will arrest the 41st vessel that comes in? Will the Minister provide clarity on that?

That is up to the Naval Service, and I have no direct responsibility in relation to the Naval Service. I assure the Deputy that there have been discussions between my Department and the Department of Defence on the implementation of the regulations that are in situ.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	160	In recent weeks this country has seen an unprecedented rise in the incidence of unpremeditated violence on our streets. Does the Taoiseach not accept that the policy pursued by this Government and the previous Government of zero tolerance lies in a complete and utter shambles? Does he accept that the solemn promise made in the programme for Government of a society where all people can feel safe in their homes, businesses and communities is a total sham?In 2002, the rise in serious crime was more than 22%. There were 1,886 more assaults than in 2001, 16 assaults and nine sexual offences every day in 2002 and 34,000 incidents of public drunkenness. On top of that, there was a solemn commitment by the Taoiseach and the Government to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí, but we got a statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that this will not happen. Does the Taoiseach accept that, as the head of Government, he is presiding over an absolutely disastrous State in terms of the implementation of law and order and of forming a society where people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes? Arising from those statistics, will he tell the House and the country what he proposes to do about this in the interests of having a normal society?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The Government has acknowledged that the increase in crime in the past few years is unacceptable and very disappointing. We have also pointed out that we will continue to put in additional resources in terms of manpower, pri son places, and changes to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and criminal justice legislation as well as other measures. Only yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spelled out in particular six measures, some legislative, which he intends to introduce as soon as possible, relating to drink and licensed premises.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and the other initiatives being brought forward are useful. These include a mandatory age card for a specific age cohort if they wish to buy and consume alcohol in a licensed premises. Plain clothes gardaí will have the right to be on licensed premises to stop under age drinking, there will be new and heavier penalties for drunkenness in licensed premises, gardaí will have the power to seek the closure of premises, there will be a prohibition on those under 18 years of age remaining in licensed premises, closed circuit television will be extended and there will be other initiatives to empower the gardaí to take the necessary measures.We allocated huge resources in the budget to allow gardaí to deal with the situation. It is a fact that the figures have gone up in the past few years, mainly through drink related crime and public order elements, but there was a fall of almost a quarter for a number of years prior to that. The solution is to deal with the two areas where there are problems – drink and the intoxicating liquor legislation coupled with public order and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. That is what we will do to return to the previous position and address the figures that are higher than we would like.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The stark failure of this Government is its inability to enforce current regulations, never mind new ones. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not take the opportunity with the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill to mention any of the six proposals he now has. How is it proposed to act on those proposals when the gardaí say that any cutbacks in overtime will have dire consequences for visibility on the streets? The single biggest issue for all communities is the presence of gardaí on the streets. They must be visible because it is not only a source of comfort, it is a source of protection and a deterrent to those who would break the law.How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with this? Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform get the extra resources from the Minister for Finance to ensure Garda visibility on the streets and the implementation of the proposals on drink and public order? Why has the Government failed to introduce any initiative, even in respect of parents, when 34,000 incidents of public drunkenness took place last year, when a young man taking money from an ATM had his throat slit and when people on the streets are kicked senseless in unprovoked acts of extreme  violence? The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are presiding over this. The time for talking is over, we must now have action.

Is what happened at the weekend not every parent's nightmare – the horrific, life threatening assault of a young man for no apparent reason? There is nothing new about this. This is the present Minister reaping the whirlwind of six years of zero tolerance. Does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recall his predecessor saying that he would be judged by whether people considered the streets to be safer and feeling secure in their homes at the end of his term of office? This is the legacy – 300 serious offences per year and nine vicious assaults in the past nine months that have maimed young people.I do not take cheap shots at the present Minister. I may not agree with him but I have high regard for his ability. He runs the risk, however, of ridicule if he does not stop making announcements and do something to enforce the law. How come there was no garda within easy distance on Grafton Street on the night? Can the Minister give the Taoiseach a note to tell him how many gardaí patrol the city centre area at weekends? Why is there no visible Garda presence? Why are there no community policemen on the beat? Why is that no longer regarded as a deterrent?Garda reform is as desperately needed as are the 2,000 gardaí the Government did not deliver. That people cannot go to bed at night during the weekend for fear that their teenagers will be the subject of a vicious and unprovoked assault is a matter for which the Taoiseach must be responsible. It is not good enough to say to Deputy Kenny that the Taoiseach has no responsibility for enforcement. The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government and the situation is getting worse every year. The figures for 2000 were a disaster, those for 2001, which the Government delayed until after the general election, were worse and preliminary figures for 2002 are worse again. That is the trend. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should realise this is not a laughing matter.

The Chair will insist upon that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	195	As I have stated, we have acknowledged that the figures for 2002 are high, as were the figures for 2001. I have been asked what we are doing about this. We have devoted and will continue to devote major resources to ensure that where crimes are committed, criminal law is adequate to deal with them. We have put more than 1,000 extra gardaí on the streets, the highest number ever. Garda numbers are up and the budget has increased by 60%. We have put legislation in place in all the key areas where there are difficulties and we will continue to do that. We have prioritised recruitment and training.Deputy Rabbitte rightly points out that crime levels are at their highest in the city centre. The Minister has provided for specialist units, both under cover and plain clothes, to deal with drugs, drink and public order issues. It is perhaps not solving the problems but the Minister is endeavouring to deal with them.With regard to enforcement, the Minister has spelt out what he is doing in the area of legislation and in terms of resources. He has addressed with the Garda what needs to be done on enforcement. It is not a question that the Government has ignored or washed its hands in respect of any of these initiatives. In a busy legislative period in the area of liquor licensing and public order, we hope to strengthen those aspects of the law the Garda and the courts have indicated to be deficient. We will continue to  provide the necessary resources in the Estimates.We should not ignore the fact that the Garda budget has increased by 60%, from €600 million only a few years ago to almost €1 billion today. These are not small figures. To have more than 12,000 gardaí in a small country is proportionately far higher in terms of size of population than in other areas.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	198	On the question of reform, I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's views on Garda supervision. The Minister has made that a priority. He has taken initiatives on the question of manning levels and reforming the system. We have introduced legislative controls, but more needs to be done. The Minister has outlined his proposals in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The Taoiseach appears not to accept that he has been in office for six years. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been in office with him for approximately half of that period. Is the Taoiseach aware that by comparison with 2000, crime figures for 2002 indicate that serious assaults have increased by 187%, sexual offences by 113%, drug offences by 62%, homicides by 58% and headline offences by 44%? There have already been six gangland killings this year.However, I do no want to divert from the question of safety on the streets. After six years in office, will the Taoiseach indicate when the law will be enforced? We do not need further legislation for that. When will there be a visible Garda presence on the streets?The Minister keeps promising new legislation. When will it be introduced to the House? The Minister inherited a milk and water Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill from his predecessor. It is a harmless measure and Second Stage was debated at the outset of his period in office.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I did not say that. It is a milk and water measure. If the Minister is to base his legislative career on tackling public order offences on the strength of this measure, which he inherited from his predecessor, he may as well return to the drawing board now.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The Minister is not basing his legislative proposals in this area solely on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. He has consulted the Garda Síochána and last night he spelt out the legislative measure he intends to take.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Minster has also allocated increased resources to other measures, such as closed circuit television. We can argue over the statistics all day. Crime levels are higher, but crime per head of the population is probably unchanged. Nevertheless, it is still too high and we must take the necessary measure to deal with it. In this regard I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on the need for greater enforcement. A tougher public order Bill is required, as are tougher laws dealing with intoxicating liquor and liquor licensing.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The Government has provided for substantial numbers of extra gardaí. Increased resources for overtime have been provided every year. We have also worked hard with the Garda Síochána to provide for reform and to ensure there is greater Garda visibility. If people see more gardaí on the streets they have a greater sense of confidence.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Will the Taoiseach indicate the number of gardaí in the city centre?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Government can seek to ensure that the Garda training college in Templemore produces the highest possible output of new gardaí. We have been doing this for a number of years.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	212	At their weekend conference, the Progressive Democrats rightly stressed the need to tackle high insurance costs. However, I worry that the Government appears unwilling to accept any link between costs of insurance for flooding and climate change. On Question Time earlier today, I pointed out to the Taoiseach that he must understand that radical action in this area is needed. However, it is difficult to accept that the Government is serious when on "Morning Ireland" the Minister for the Environment and Local Government confuses the ozone layer with the greenhouse effect while the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, tries to claim that the flooding last year was exceptional and that with the current spell of dry weather everything is fine again.I ask the Government to heed the expert view of the International Panel on Climate Change or, closer to home, Dr. John Sweeney of the NUI in Maynooth, who stress that the extremes of weather in terms of flooding and drought are to be expected with climate change and that this is happening around the world. Notwithstanding  the call by the IPCC that there is a need for a 60% cut in CO2 emissions world-wide, I ask the Government to look seriously at how it is failing to comply even with its agreed allowance of 13% growth in CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 over 1990 levels.I know the Taoiseach will respond by saying we have a national climate change strategy. Is there a replacement in the climate change strategy for the fact that Moneypoint is not now to be converted to gas? Is there any way of dealing with the fact that there was an expectation that 3.5 million tonnes, or 30% of the overall 15 million tonnes in the strategy, was to be accounted for by the conversion of the Moneypoint generating plant to the use of gas? Now that this will not happen, what will the Government do to save that 3.5 million tonnes which will not now be saved given that Moneypoint will remain fuelled by coal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I dealt with this matter earlier today on Question Time. In response to a question by Deputy Sargent, I said the Government would review the national climate change strategy to ensure that we have adequate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to meet our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. To the best of my knowledge, no provision has been made to deal with the Moneypoint initiative. However, we must continue to fulfil our obligations and the Government is committed to this approach.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	218	We have proposed a number of measures which are included in the national climate change strategy and we have indicated they will be reviewed to ensure we meet our targets. Deputy Sargent does not accept we have reviewed, and are in the process of implementing, the strategy, but that is the Government's position.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The Taoiseach should not mislead the House. He says we will continue to comply with our obligations. However, by 2000, Ireland was already 24% over the 1990 levels. That figure is increasing rapidly, even though 13% was the limit set for 2008. Will the Taoiseach indicate if there is to be a clear indication of what will  replace the input of the Moneypoint generator in the national strategy? To say that the strategy will be reviewed does not answer my question. There will be no replacement of Moneypoint, according to the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach change the transport policy whereby the cost ratio of roads to public transport is 5:1? Will he consider the cut in tax incentives for wind energy which we discussed earlier and the reliance on incineration which will pump further CO2 into the atmosphere?Will the Taoiseach face up to the fact that Ireland will be fined an estimated €1.2 billion per year if the current rate of emissions continues? That money should be spent on crime, health, education and in many other areas. The Government is set to squander it simply because it cannot face the reality of the challenge it signed up to at Kyoto. Will the Taoiseach say what he intends to examine in the review which is forthcoming? What will replace Moneypoint in the short-term, given that it will be fuelled by coal according to the ESB?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The Deputy will be aware from answers given earlier that Moneypoint will switch to gas. On taxation—

An examination of wind energy is under way. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have been considering proposals to provide investors with new means of engaging in wind energy production profitably. Without some subsidisation, it will not work.

I can provide more substantive briefing notes if they are necessary.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I do not wish to be disruptive, merely to make the point that the committee members are being given a briefing in committee on substantial changes and are then being asked to take Committee Stage directly afterwards without the opportunity to table amendments. That is not a good way to do business.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Is the proposal agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, statements on Northern Ireland, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the Private Notice Question agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' Business agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 17, Broadcasting (Major Events Television  Coverage) (Amendment) Bill 2003: Report and Final Stages, agreed?

While we will not call a division on the matter, we wish to record our opposition to the use of the guillotine.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	257	It could be deemed to be sharp practice.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I heard some comments from the Progressive Democrats conference over the weekend. The Tánaiste appeared to be taken up with the issue of competitiveness. It is just a year since the Motor Insurance Advisory Board reported and made its recommendations. We have slipped from fifth in the world in competitiveness in 1996 to 24th. Business is being hit by a range of extra charges and obstacles. One of these is insurance. In light of the Tánaiste's comments, will the Taoiseach expedite the personal injuries assessment board Bill? When will we see that legislation before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The heads of that Bill should be published after Easter for consultation. It is necessary that it be made available in that form so that people can comment on it. It will be available after Easter.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Another ten years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	263	That measure was ready to go on a pilot basis in May 1997. Is the legislation to establish the minor reform of the personal injuries assessment board the only legislative measure the Government will bring forward to deal with the crisis in the insurance industry?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Is other legislation promised?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	265	There are at least two other Bills. There will be legislation in the justice area to deal with fraudulent claims and in the transport area to deal with the road safety issues that surround this. I hope the personal injuries assessment board legislation will be progressed quickly. I understand it will be published later this year.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	266	When the Taoiseach goes to meet other European Union leaders, he may well be asked about the International Criminal Court Bill given the atrocities in Iraq. What answer will he give to other EU leaders as to when the Bill might be published? Will he ask them to talk to the Bush Administration in America about its involvement with the criminal court?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The legislation is a priority listing for the next session.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	269	In respect of the Government's anti-inflation legislation, will there be legislation to deal with prices and mark-ups. Food prices in shops are rising by 4% and at factory and farm gates they are falling by 5%.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	270	We cannot discuss the possible content of legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The context is important for the Taoiseach to assess the urgency.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	273	A Cheann Comhairle, you must allow some fair play to Members who wish to raise points.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The Chair will allow fair play and that is the reason I cannot allow the Deputy preference over other Members.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	275	There is a long established and clear precedent in the House for giving the context of requests for the early production of legislation. If the Taoiseach does not believe the rip-off of consumers—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Deputy Bruton, you are out of order.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	277	—in the shops is not important, I would like to know what the Government has to say.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18293	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Is there legislation? The Government has not indicated?

Under which of the two promised heritage Bills is it intended to bring that measure before the House? Is it intended to come under the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill or under the National Monuments Bill or is it  intended to introduce separate legislation to give effect to the extraordinary decision by the Government to break up Dúchas?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has just made an announcement on this. Deputies should table or ask a question in one of the ways they can whereby he can make a statement on the matter.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The Taoiseach does not know.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	288	It was cleared at Cabinet today and the Minister would be glad to make a statement on it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I call Deputy Ó Caoláin.

This should not be a difficult question for the Taoiseach to answer. If a decision was made today, he ought to be able to remember under which Bill this will be brought in. In which of the two promised Bills on heritage—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Deputy has made his point.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	293	To the best of my knowledge, but I may be incorrect, I understand the Minister does not need to introduce it under either of these Bills. He can do this on an administrative basis.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	294	No.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Maybe I am wrong.

Is it correct that this Bill will be published in the next few days? Will it be introduced through the Seanad or the Dáil? Will it be prioritised in the schedule of legislation the Government intends to press as it is sorely needed by workers who are—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The legislation is a priority and will be published this month and must be enacted before June.

They do not know where to send Departments to. I assume if the Progressive Democrats want decentralisation, they will get it. They are punching above their weight.

Is the Taoiseach pushing this legislation forward to dilute the functions of the National Monuments Bill, which is already in place?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I will allow a comment on when the Bill is to come before the House, not on what it might contain.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The powers and functions Bill is to clarify the extent of the Minister's powers and functions in relation to by-laws and regulations relating to properties in the care or ownership of the Minister. The heads of that Bill have been approved and legislation is being drafted but it is unlikely to be available until next year.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I thank the House for this opportunity to speak about recent political developments in Northern Ireland. While there is undoubtedly disappointment that it has not yet proved possible to see the movement we had hoped for last week, I believe that we still have an opportunity to bring our work to finality. I cannot say at this time when we will be able to do so but the goal of both Governments is to complete our work as soon as possible so that we can present the fruits of our efforts over the past several months.Since the suspension of the institutions in October 2002, the two Governments have con centrated our energies on the restoration of trust and confidence on all sides. A deficit of confidence on each side surrounding the commitment of the other to the full operation of the Agreement was, in the view of the Governments, central to the destabilisation of the institutions and their suspension. At an early stage, we recognised that the most effective way of ensuring mutual confidence on all sides was by looking towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and removing all the obstacles that stood in the way of its full implementation.The phrase "acts of completion" captures both the enormity and the simplicity of what is required. It reflects an end to instability and lack of confidence, the attainment of a satisfactory finishing point in all aspects of implementation and a completion of the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively peaceful means. It is a substantial and demanding task but one which Prime Minister Blair and I decided we should pursue in the interests of underpinning the Agreement and restoring stability and trust in Northern Ireland.To achieve completion, it will have to be clear, as set out in the joint statement of the two Governments in October 2002, that paramilitary activity and capability is being brought to an end; that the process of security normalisation is rapidly advancing; that the achievement of the new beginning to policing is being fully realised; that the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland is fully reflective of both communities; that the human rights and equality provisions of the Agreement are being entrenched; and that the stop-start phase of the operation of the institutions has come to an end and that all parties are committed to fully and wholeheartedly participating in them.These involve complex and difficult areas. There are differing perspectives between the parties and finalising our work has not proved easy. We did not expect it to be but we will continue to expend all our energies on it. As I have made clear, acts of completion must see an end to all paramilitary activity and the putting beyond use, finally, of all paramilitary weapons. This is basic and essential. We wish to see the restoration and full operation of the institutions of the Agreement, to return decision-making on local issues to locally accountable Ministers in Northern Ireland. Acts of completion would also allow policing and justice to be devolved on a robust and workable basis, subject to agreement between the parties.Most important, acts of completion would allow the full potential of the Agreement to be fostered and developed to the highest degree, with positive outcomes, tangible dividends and constructive opportunities for communities and individuals throughout the island of Ireland. We want a police service representative of all sections of the community, supported by all sections of the community, and being held accountable by the chosen representatives of all sections of the community. People have to decide in their own demo cratic way how to address issues, but it is clear that the time has come when the new police service – and its officers now being recruited on an equal basis as Patten intended – is entitled to the support and co-operation of the entire community. We look forward to seeing Sinn Féin taking their place on the policing board sooner rather than later. Such a move will be facilitated by the continued implementation of the Patten reforms and through the delivery of all acts of completion necessary to bring about the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.In the area of security normalisation, there is immense potential at present for conclusive advances towards the Good Friday Agreement's goal of as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland. We wish to see this goal achieved and believe it can be achieved in the context of the Governments' joint proposals. We want to see a Northern Ireland in which people are free to go about their daily lives in an environment of normality and safety.In the context of the acts of completion which I have outlined earlier, and following what I hope will be the early restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I look forward to the North-South Ministerial Council being able to resume its regular meetings. It has not been possible to hold these meetings while the Assembly is suspended. The intensive discussions that took place at Hillsborough on 3 and 4 March saw draft proposals being discussed and further developed between the Governments and the pro-Agreement parties. Following these discussions, a large measure of shared understanding emerged on what was required to move the process forward in the way that was desired by all sides.Let me make it clear that Hillsborough achieved a great deal. Issues that had remained unresolved for years were addressed and most of them were reconciled in a fair and acceptable way to the parties. However, we could not close on everything at Hillsborough and discussions since then have been focused on doing this. The Governments firmly support the comprehensive proposals that have been developed and feel that they form a comprehensive framework within which acts of completion should occur on all sides.The meeting which President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and I held with the parties at Hillsborough last week offered a further opportunity to emphasise and elaborate on the key points of significance which the Governments believe should form the basis for progress. In the statement that we issued following our meeting, we said that the proposals of the two Governments held out the prospect of enormous progress. We emphasised that peace is its own dividend. To further underpin the future we agreed together to look at ways to encourage the flow of investment to Northern Ireland. I very much welcome the US President's continuing interest in achieving a positive outcome to the current  challenges in Northern Ireland and of his willingness to lend the full support of the United States to our efforts. The role of Ambassador Haass in recent days has been extremely valuable.The political parties have all made strong and positive contributions, despite the differing political needs and pressures that influence them, to finding a way forward on a collective basis through the complex issues that need to be addressed. The time devoted by Prime Minister Blair to these issues in the fraught current circumstances bear witness to the personal and real commitment to partnership which has been demonstrated throughout this process by the British Government.The last week has been a very demanding and testing time for those of us who are closely involved with the negotiations in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to bring the package to a conclusion in time for it to be published last Thursday, as we had hoped. Instead, we have continued to work with the parties to conclude the process of achieving the necessary clarity on the required acts of completion. I met with Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams and SDLP leader Mark Durkan on Saturday in an effort to maintain momentum towards closure on outstanding difficulties. I also spoke on several occasions over the weekend and since with Prime Minister Blair. These contacts both between the Governments and with the parties have continued since the weekend.Yesterday, the two Governments welcomed the positive aspects of a draft IRA statement which was passed to us on Sunday evening. We acknowledged that it showed that much progress had been made and that it reflected a desire to make the peace process work. However, we also asked for clarification on a number of issues. Obviously it is important that the two Governments reflect very carefully to ensure that there is a basis on which we can proceed. The imperative of the popular mandate of the Agreement cannot be put aside and we must all recognise our responsibility to take and facilitate the further steps necessary to ensure its full implementation.We all welcomed and celebrated the new dawn with the signing of the Agreement and now five years later, it is no longer adequate simply to profess ourselves still dedicated to the Agreement. We must make clear the strides we are all willing to take to move the process to completion to enable the Agreement to deliver on its full potential.Some steps are, undoubtedly, more challenging than others. The opportunity offered through clear and wholehearted acts of completion is ours to embrace and I hope that our efforts can meet with success. The Government is totally committed and engaged in this effort. I commend the contribution of my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who have invested enormous effort in trying to bring our work to a  successful conclusion in recent weeks and days, in particular.On a personal note, over the past five years as Taoiseach the task that I have put and will continue to put above all others in my political life is to ensure that the people of this island remain united around the Good Friday Agreement. On this week of Good Friday, it remains my great political objective and desire to see the Agreement fully work and see its provisions fully implemented. Working with the British Government and the parties, I will do everything I can to achieve this.I thank the Opposition parties, particularly the main Opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, for the understanding and support they have shown, as have all parties in the House. It has been a difficult process. I would like to make a fuller and more detailed statement but I think the parties understand that is not possible, for which I thank them. I will continue to keep them informed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I thank the Taoiseach for his comments. It is fair to say every Member of the House shares the sentiments of the Government in this matter, namely, that the Good Friday Agreement, in its entirety, should be brought to a conclusion. We are again at a point where that is tantalisingly close. Given the images on our television screens from the far side of the world, it is obvious that there can be no going back over the past 30 years of desolation and paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.I was contacted on Sunday evening by a member of Sinn Féin, whom I thanked for his contact, on the basis that a definitive decision and statement was being issued by the IRA that would deal with the outstanding issues of clarification which were requested. As Opposition parties, we are not really central to the process in that we have not seen or been furnished with the proposals from either Government or the statement from Sinn Féin. I expected that the Sinn Féin statement would deal with the matters outstanding but it did not. On this occasion, the Governments were right to seek clarification on whatever matters they considered to be outstanding. It is fair to say that in the negotiations and discussions over the last number of years, Sinn Féin has repeatedly sought clarification from both Governments on a range of issues and circumstances ad nauseam. From its perspective, it is right to do so. Vested with the constitutional authority of the peoples of Great Britain and Ireland, the Governments were right to seek absolute clarification in respect of matters they considered to be outstanding.We are again almost at endgame. If it is not endgame, I would hate to think it might be game over. The outstanding issues remain to be clarified. I suppose as we speak discussions are going on between Government parties and the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland. I genuinely hope that before the Taoiseach and the  Prime Minister fly to Athens this evening, this matter will be finally resolved. A sequence has been laid out which, if followed through, could see this brought to a conclusion very rapidly whereby everybody in the country could rejoice, people could get on with their business, normality could be restored and people could achieve their full potential.However, if the statement issued by the IRA is not to be changed in any way, then verification of that and the authenticity of verbal clarification of those issues will have to be very clear. If, for instance, the leader or a member of another party interprets that statement for their party, it might not mean what the Government understands it to mean. I hope verification and clarification of that statement by whoever will lead to trust and compromise. I say trust in respect of both Governments having a clear and full understanding that on this occasion the game, or the war, is over and that while those words may never be used in a statement by the IRA, we can take it that what we have known for the past 30 years will be finished.If the IRA does not have a constitution which allows for it to be disbanded and if it is to "continue", then the independent monitoring committee and everybody else should be very clear that there are to be no further acts of paramilitarism, knee-capping and beatings and that that applies both North and South of the Border. We do not want to see a situation arise like that in Bray some months ago where preparations were being made to carry out some acts. I accept on trust, if that is absolutely verified, that the game, or the war, is over, that there will be no more of this and that we will move on to the avenue of participative democracy with the act of decommissioning to be verified by General de Chastelain in accordance with the process in place. If both Governments are prepared to accept that, Mr. Trimble must be able to say to his people that what is on the table is final and that he can get on with his convention, the restoration of the Assembly and the institutions and letting the people of Northern Ireland decide who they want to elect to that regional assembly.As leader of the Fine Gael Party, it has been my privilege to go to Northern Ireland on a number of occasions in recent months and to bring with me newer Members of the Oireachtas from our parliamentary party, both TDs and Senators, to give them a flavour of the complexity of the issues of Northern Ireland with which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others have been dealing over the years, whether in Cluan Place, Tigers Bay, the Falls Road or the Shankill. Their view on the politics of Northern Ireland and on the way people perceive Northern Ireland and their understanding of the difficulties with which people in Northern Ireland must deal, whether from a Sinn Féin or a Unionist perspective, has changed utterly as a result of their exposure to that kind of complexity. Such visits provide a stark understanding to Oireachtas  Members of how difficult and painful this process has been and how much patience and resilience has been required.I commend all the leaders of the pro-Agreement parties and all those associated with this process for the commitment they have shown. I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for the efforts they have made and the commitment they have persistently shown in trying to sort this out. Prime Minister Blair has shown undue commitment from a British perspective to a cause in which we all believe, that is, peace, co-operation, understanding and power sharing.I also pay tribute to the leaders of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, for the way in which they have reached this point where we are almost at endgame. I do not know at which point on that journey their political minds became fixed on the democratic route. I am not really interested in the Tánaiste's comments last weekend about Mr. Adams and whether Sinn Féin and the IRA are the same, as I am more interested in the end result of this process. I do not wish to stand in judgment over anybody, but I would like to make it perfectly clear that there can be no ambiguity as we move forward from here. I said to Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness that I do not want an "army" to be still around and involved in activities of a criminal or paramilitary nature. I have had discussions with David Trimble, Reg Empey and Dermot Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party, who have defended their position very resolutely.The Agreement does not receive ten marks out of ten, as it is not perfect in every respect, but extra understanding and compromise are needed on the part of all involved for its full implementation and its future. We are obviously very close to this. The former US President, John F. Kennedy, once said that "no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings" and that "man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do it again". Those who have worked in the North, including the leaders and parties who have gone before us, have played their part in putting together the jigsaw and colouring in the picture to the point where it is now. I would like the final acts of completion to take place without further delay and the elections to take place on time. Undermining the elections by postponing them further will not do anybody any good.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, has played a role in the process. There is little else to be said from this perspective, as we cannot directly influence the final clarification. I would also like to compliment the US special envoy, Mr. Haass, who has tried to build on what George Mitchell put together five years ago. I ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind that the US Congress, which is controlled by the Republicans, restored the United States's full contribution of $24 million to the International  Fund For Ireland after the US President, Mr. Bush, proposed to it that the fund be reduced to $8.5 million. I understand that the arbitration committee may find it difficult to acquire all the moneys for the fund, following the passing of a major proposal to cut taxes by about $700 billion in the US. I would not like to see the fund diminished, given that it has created thousands of jobs along the Border and has been of interest to the economies North and South.When I spoke recently to the leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan, I was struck by his commitment and his party's commitment to its involvement in the policing board. The genuine political risk taken by the SDLP in majoring on this issue, as well as its total involvement in the issue of policing, which is central to the process, shows that it is committed to the future of Northern Ireland. I note the presence in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery of Bríd Rodgers and Seán Farren and, on behalf of Fine Gael, I pay tribute to them and the members of the SDLP for the work they have done over the years.A new future beckons for the island of Ireland following the elections and the restoration of the Assembly, if this phase of the peace process can be brought to a successful conclusion today or tomorrow. I have personal experience of the area of international tourism and I know it is possible to market the entire island of Ireland, as distinct from two entities. Following the Canary Wharf bomb in the 1990s, I recall that it was recommended that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte should not have a presence at the second biggest tourism show in the world, at Earls Court in London. Rather than having two stands promoting regions of Ireland, it was decided to promote the island of Ireland on the same stand. For the first time in many years, one could see pride in people's faces because they were marketing internationally the concept of Irish tourism both North and South. Such a single entity does not interfere with the political dimensions preferred by parties on both sides of the Border and I hope, above anything else, that it will be backed by the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, the Assembly, when it reassembles, and both Governments. It should be allowed to work and to do its business.Similarly, mutual co-operation can benefit those North and South of the Border in areas such as agriculture, health, medicine, education, transport, intelligence information and broadband access. The fact that such potential exists was demonstrated by the co-operation between the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and his Northern counterpart, Bríd Rodgers, as well as their Departments, during the foot and mouth disease scare. Co-operation can enhance development in bodies like the North-South Ministerial Council, the Food Safety Promotion Board, Waterways Ireland, the North-South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. I ask the Govern ment to reconsider the reduction in funding to the North-South Language Body, something which should not be allowed to happen.I appreciate that a number of barriers have yet to be overcome. I understand and empathise with the difficulty and sensitivity that surround the remaining obstacles. The Taoiseach was right to ask for further clarification if he was unhappy with the statement issued by the IRA to both Governments, which I have not seen. I understand that the Taoiseach has spoken to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, about the outstanding matters of clarification. Members of Sinn Féin said to me publicly in Belfast that they do not represent the IRA, but that they have influence over it. I hope that the remaining set of obstacles in respect of clarification and verification can be overcome. If such clarification is given verbally or orally in a way that both Governments can stand over, it should also be acceptable to the Unionist community to allow for the restoration of the Assembly and the holding of elections. As I have said, the Agreement is not perfect and is not an absolute instrument, but it is the best we have got. It holds a great deal of potential and opportunity for many people. I hope that the next generation can look back and say that everybody who was involved in this process was really committed to the future of Ireland.The comment of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, that "the hand of history" is still very much on us is quite true. Similarly, there was an historic moment 91 years ago today when Belfast's most famous export, the unsinkable Titanic, was lost in the Atlantic. In this case, however, we can prevent a political tragedy by averting the prevention of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I genuinely hope that the small number of people involved in the last remnants of this process can see it in their hearts and political minds to do it this time. If this happens, all sides of the House will be able to say that we were involved in a process which affected the social and economic well-being of the peoples of this island, North and South. We have stood by progress, defended principles in this area and clearly stood for non-involvement with private armies.I hope there will finally be clarity and the matter will be truly ended. I look forward to the next few hours and days. I wish the Taoiseach and Deputy Cowen well in their endeavours. I hope all others involved in the process will show similar commitment and express a similar attitude of compromise that can lead to the trust and confidence that will allow us to move on to other business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I hoped that when we came to make these statements, there would at last be some degree of certainty about a package of measures, including a statement from the IRA. It appears now that it will be some time yet – I hope, a short time – before that certainty is  arrived at. I understand the tenor of the Taoiseach's earlier remarks in that regard.The Government has our broad support in the efforts it is undertaking to bring this phase of the process to a conclusion. I am saying that on the assumption that the Government has been firm in its dealings with Sinn Féin in recent days. It is essential now that all of us in this House unite in our support for the people and politicians of Northern Ireland, as they seek to ensure that so-called "acts of completion" are put in place to secure the future of the Good Friday Agreement There is no greater present we could give to the people of Northern Ireland, or the island as a whole, than a long spell of uninterrupted political stability, where democratic government, based on the consent of the governed, was the central and only feature of all political activity.The key to that long spell of democratic political activity lies in the hands of P. O'Neill, the mythical signatory of statements from the Provisional IRA. The statement on which they have closed and which is now in the hands of both Governments, must be capable of only one interpretation. It must mean, unequivocally, that democratic politicians are free to go about their business, in this case the business of building a dynamic economy and a fair and just society in Northern Ireland, without ever having to worry again about the threat of violence from a paramilitary source.I know that many statements have issued over the years from P. O'Neill which bore all the hallmarks of deep theological training and which often required the skills of a highly Jesuitical mind to interpret and analyse. From the very beginning of this process, back to the first IRA ceasefire, there has been room for ambiguity in everything said and written.All the so-called "terms of art" that have underpinned the process down the years have enabled statements and positions to be constructed that have the ability to mean different things to different audiences and that has often been necessary. However, now there is no longer room for doubt. If politics is the future, armed struggle is the past.I have praised the leadership of Provisional Sinn Féin on other occasions in this House for leading the members of that party on a long and arduous struggle down the road of peace. All of us in this House have recognised how difficult a job it has been at times. That road has an end and the end is now. Following the IRA ceasefire in 1994, there was general acceptance that the republican movement would need time and space to make the transition from violence to democracy. There was an understanding that the leadership was committed to moving towards full participation in our democratic system, but that it would require time to convince others in the republican movement. Anyone who understands anything about our political history knew that it would take time, that there would be slippage and that there would be problems.In recent years all of us too have from time to time bitten our lips. We have refrained from expressing the frustration we have felt at the slowness of the process. Too often over the past four years, it seemed to have been a case of two steps forward and one step back or even, on some occasions, one step forward and two steps back. Too often it has seemed as if the leadership of the republican movement was prepared to move only at the pace of its most recalcitrant member. Too often it has seemed that that slow pace was putting the process itself at risk.Let the republican movement now be the ones to take the final risk. Following 11 September there is no tolerance of terrorism in a civilised society. We will all applaud the day the entire republican movement has the vision and the foresight to say that democracy is the only way forward. The republican movement ended 30 years of conflict with its military wing, the IRA, undefeated. The undefeated IRA should now tell us, as clearly as it can, that the war is over. No one in this House or elsewhere will interpret such a statement as an admission of defeat.The republican movement has said again and again – and I for one am prepared to take what it says at face value – that it represents no threat to the peace process. It has it in its hands now to provide a positive benefit to the peace process.It has been said before, but it bears repeating here that a movement that describes itself as political, that has made significant political gains on both parts of this island and that is significantly represented in this House, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, in the Westminster Parliament, and on some local authorities throughout this island, does not need semtex. A movement that sees itself as pursuing democratic goals through democratic means does not need guns. A movement that is committed to the dynamics of political contest, that is seeking to build a strong political base in every democratic forum, must not shy away from declaring that it is no longer at war.Last November I suggested that it was time for a new analysis, an analysis that says republicans and Nationalists derive strength and confidence from peace and from democratic involvement. The old ways, just like the old days, are gone and the only way forward now is through politics. Making politics work requires drudgery, for sure, and we all here know that, but it does not require terror or violence. If the republican movement takes that last logical step of putting into words what it is already putting into practice, it will have a right to demand the only appropriate response from Unionism, the resumption of full democratic political engagement through the operation of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.We must never lose sight of what has been the primary achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, that it has brought a degree of peace, albeit flawed and imperfect, not experienced in Northern Ireland over the previous 30 years. The passage of time can dull the memory to the horrors  that were inflicted on Northern Ireland for such a long period. In 1993, just a decade ago, 90 people died in politically motivated violence arising from the Northern conflict. In January, Julie Statham a 20 year old student, took her own life just weeks after her boyfriend, Diarmuid Shields and his father, Patrick, were murdered by the UVF. It did not get any better as the year went on. On 3 March, three year old Jonathan Ball and 12 year old Tim Parry were murdered in an IRA bomb attack in Warrington in England. In October, ten people died in an IRA bomb attack in a fish shop in the Shankill Road. The loyalist response was almost as brutal, with the "trick or treat" gun attack on the Rising Sun public house in Greysteel. Republicans were responsible for the deaths of 39 people and loyalists for the deaths of 48. In 1993 the security forces were not responsible for any deaths.There is still violence in Northern Ireland and one death from politically motivated violence is a death too many, but the fact is that were it not for the Good Friday Agreement many more people would have died. There is no viable alternative to the Good Friday Agreement and its commitment to equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these islands. The key now, and the breakthrough we need to see, is the recognition that the agreement and its democratic framework is the only way forward.The general approach of seeking to deal with all outstanding issues arising from the Agreement in the talks now effectively concluded was the correct one. We must end the stop-start approach. We must remove the instability and uncertainty. Most of all, we must end the series of crises that have bedevilled the process from almost the beginning and replace it with stability and certainty.The Taoiseach said that the time has come for the new police service, drawn from both sides of the community, and that it is entitled to the support and co-operation of the entire community. I agree with that. I also agree with the Taoiseach that there may be some who want to make their own judgment in terms of timing and participation on the police board. Like Deputy Kenny, I pay tribute to the courageous and visionary leadership of the SDLP in this regard. In keeping with the sober and sensible leadership they have given throughout the northern conflict, this last step was a particularly courageous one and is likely to become to be recognised as such.I understand from the public statement issued by the IRA that it will restore, or perhaps even already have, its relationship with the de Chastelain Commission. I understand, too, that we can shortly expect a major act of decommissioning, presumably as part of a process leading to the elimination of all weapons and material. Nothing could be more welcome, because it would be an end to the system of "each-way bets" that has made the republican movement so distrusted by  those whom they wish to regard as partners – the Unionist community. We have all said before, in debates like these, that no one can be allowed to take an each-way bet on democracy. One cannot choose to be a democrat one day and revert to violence on another. The restart of the decommissioning process, and this time its progression to a final conclusion, will be all the more welcome for that.If everything is right in the next couple of days, the Ulster Unionist Party will also be asked to accept that the war is over. I hope they will find it in their hearts to do so. Stable government in Northern Ireland over the next five years will require courage and imagination on all sides. It will require a leap of faith by the people of Northern Ireland, and the rebuilding of trust.It is one of the saddest ironies of all that as we celebrate this week the fifth anniversary of the Belfast Agreement, and despite the political progress that has been made, the central task of reconciliation in a divided community has barely begun. There remains a need to encourage the allegiance of the loyalist community to the Belfast Agreement. Hopefully, the last obstacle will be removed when the IRA finally declares that the only future is a political one, and when the principle of consent is thus accepted across the entire community. Knowing as we do that nothing can ever be taken for granted in this process, and knowing as we do that all too often we have had to endure setbacks before making progress, may I conclude by expressing the fervent hope that this time the war is finally about to end.I had expected the debate today would be truly historic. We have not got there yet, but the Government has our full support in taking advantage of the current environment to ensure this week will indeed be the start of a new political dawn on this island.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	388	It is clear as we speak today that republicans, Unionists and indeed the two Governments are playing for very high stakes. It is still not clear that a form of words from the IRA is an absolute commitment not to recommence war at a future date. However, we are told by the media that the wording suggests there will be no return to violence. That said, the Green Parties North and South of the Border have not seen the draft joint statement of the two Governments. Assuming it represents a sufficient commitment to acts of completion with regard to the full implementation of outstanding matters within their remit under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in particular, with regard to policing and demilitarisation, but also with regard to strand 1 – the stability of the Northern Ireland institutions – and strand 2, which should include  consideration of establishing a North-South parliamentary forum – issues and human rights – the arguments for acts of completion from republicans become overwhelming.What must acts of completion from republicans involve? Sinn Féin is not facing up to the political reality if it claims there are no links between it and the IRA and that, therefore, acts of completion are only required from the Governments. It is reasonable for Unionism to insist that the Good Friday Agreement implies that all who signed up to it be committed to the ending of paramilitarism. It is also reasonable in the presumed light of a tightly timeframed commitment from the two Governments to the full implementation of the agreement to state that now is the time for clear and unambiguous language from both Sinn Féin and the IRA to the effect that in the changed constitutional circumstances of today, which have for the first time in eight and a half centuries ended the unilateral claim of sovereignty over Ireland or any part thereof by the British crown, there is no further legitimacy for the retention of so-called arms of liberation, and that a tightly timeframed process of decommissioning is under way. Any other stance is intellectually dishonest and politically illiterate.Failure by the republican movement to cross the Rubicon now, the Rubicon of recognition that the last remnants of justification for an armed struggle is gone, opens them to the accusation that bad faith has underpinned their approach all along, that they invite the instability and disorder which will ultimately fill the political vacuum maintained by their refusal to act now. In other words, it can be said that they have been misleading people all along. We in the Green Party are not accusing them of that. We certainly say there have been many honourable men and women of undoubted political skill from the republican movement who have made enormous contributions to date. Now that they have reached their defining moment, can their organisation, or indeed organisations, recognise that moment has come?In many ways, another step on this road to full implementation would be welcome if strand 2 could be strengthened further. It would be very important in finding the agreement that is needed to have to some extent, as we already have in strand 3, the British-Irish inter-parliamentary structure in place. In paragraph 18 of the agreement, under strand 2, it is envisaged that there would be a North-South inter-parliamentary forum on this island. The Green Party calls for such a structure to be put in place as a matter of priority so that it can give full expression to a working agreement in terms of strands 1, 2 and 3.Finally, I wish to pay tribute to all the pro-agreement parties, particularly in the North and, indeed, to the two Governments. We wish them rath Dé ar an obair.

It also marks another very crucial stage in the peace process. As we speak, it is an inconclusive stage and the future implementation of the Agreement may depend on decisions made in the next few hours or days. It is very important, therefore, that we approach these statements with some restraint. Sinn Féin negotiators have worked at full stretch to achieve progress. I know that both Governments have also expended considerable energy. It is my wish and that of my Sinn Féin colleagues that collectively, all parties and both Governments will overcome the difficulties of this phase and move forward together.I urge the two Governments to publish their joint declaration – it should have been published last Thursday. While the joint declaration has not yet been published, we have had a quite unprecedented initiative by the IRA in which it has outlined to both Governments its position in detail in an effort to move the process forward. Sinn Féin has been engaged in intensive efforts to see the current deadlock ended and the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full. The IRA has responded positively to this. The two Governments have recognised the positive nature of the IRA response and have acknowledged the desire of the IRA to make the peace process work. What is the current delay about? The two Governments, the UUP and all of us should seize this opportunity.On Sunday, 13 April the IRA undertook to draw up a statement setting out its views on recent developments in the peace process. It said it did so because of its commitment to this process and its desire to see it succeed. In its statement to the Governments, it set out its attitude on the current disposition of the IRA and the status of its cessation, its future intentions, its attitude to a re-engagement with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and engagement in a process of putting arms beyond use and a third act of putting arms beyond use to be verified under the agreed scheme. The IRA said it shared concepts and draft elements on these matters with others and, following an internal consultation, closed on a statement that was passed onto the two Governments. I believe this was indeed an unprecedented engagement by the IRA and it deserves to be recognised as such. All parties and both Governments should respond positively.On Sunday evening last, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams stated that the Governments had acknowledged that the IRA statement was positive. He found it incredible that they had not acted on the basis of this unprecedented intervention. He also stated that if the Governments' request for clarification was, as they claimed, a genuine attempt to advance matters at this point, then all obstacles to progress should be removed. I understand that clarification was subsequently given.We need to put all this in context. The reality is that the Good Friday Agreement has not been  fully implemented. The Agreement was the culmination of an enormous collective effort by the two Governments and the parties to tackle the causes of conflict. It was about fundamental and deep-rooted change in Ireland. There has been significant progress. In the limited time that the institutions existed they worked and were popular. Real progress was made and the hope of further progress was generated.The talks have been focused on implementing the Agreement. In our discussions with the two Governments and the other parties we have made considerable progress on a number of specific areas. These include policing, criminal justice, the stability of the institutions, demilitarisation, human rights and equality. Yet critical issues remain and these include the transfer of power on policing and justice, the suspended status of the institutions and the absence of any clear commitment from the Ulster Unionist Party that it will work the institutions in a sustainable way. There is also the attempt to introduce sanctions against Sinn Féin, which are clearly outside the terms of the Agreement and this is unacceptable.However, we continue to engage on these issues. All the issues in the Good Friday Agreement are issues of entitlements and rights, not subject to precondition by Governments, political parties or armed groups. This time five years ago the Good Friday Agreement would have been seen as an impossible achievement. Five years on, let us not underestimate the advances that have been made.I wish all the negotiators well and look forward to real progress in the coming hours and days.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the peace process and its development on our island. I hope and pray that we have a positive engagement on this serious national issue. It is essential that we build on the magnificent progress made in the negotiations. I urge Deputies not to use this debate as a point scoring exercise and commend Deputies for not doing this so far. I also wish all groups and parties well in the negotiations. I know it is a difficult task and calls for brave and decisive leadership.However, I am concerned that the Governments and the major parties have taken their eyes off the ball. Some people even seem to be trying to rewrite this Agreement. We need to start implementing it and ensure that people's rights are respected and equality is brought back on to the agenda.I will not take any moral or ethical lectures from the likes of Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush, or anyone else in this House, regarding our peace process and conflict resolution. The slaughter in Iraq over the past 27 days has shown us where many of them stand on morality and the concept of a just war. There are people in this House that quietly supported the war from the sitting rooms. They should spare us the lectures when sections  of the Irish people are trying to resolve their differences in a peaceful and democratic manner.We should also remind ourselves that this is not the David Trimble agreement, it is the Good Friday Agreement. Many people also seem to ignore the views of the DUP. Regardless of what I think of them – I disagree strongly with the party – exclusion will not work. History has always taught us that exclusion is dangerous. I also believe that sanctions are dangerous and will not work. Neither Tony Blair nor anyone else has the right to give concessions to the Irish people. The people are entitled to their rights. Nobody has any right to block or stall that development and the extension of democracy on this island. This is what I mean by equality.It might surprise members of the media, or Members of this House, that there still exists elected politicians that believe in Irish unity and independence. We believe in a free, democratic and intercultural Ireland based on equality and respect for difference. This is the new Ireland I see emerging from the Good Friday Agreement. The Ireland I want to build is anti-sectarian, anti-racist and looks after the men and women of no property. While there is great potential in this Agreement, we need to implement it as soon as possible. We need deep-rooted change in all aspects of society and should face this change together to tackle the causes of conflict. Ganging up on one side or getting involved in the blame game will not resolve the tough issues. We have made major progress over the past five years and we need to build on this. Let us also remind ourselves that this is a peace process – it is a process towards a greater goal.I commend the leadership of Sinn Féin in its negotiations, particularly those it has held in recent days. Sinn Féin has shown decisive leadership and many future historians will probably record that its leaders had the same vision as the men and women of 1916. I long for the day when we see all the guns out of Irish politics and where political debate and dialogue replaces conflict. We have started the process, now let us move on.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I deplore, and I believe a majority of people on this island deplore, the cynical hijacking of the desire for peace here by the President of the United States and Mr. Blair in an attempt to portray themselves as men of peace, even as they were waging pitiless war in Iraq with the most cruel consequences for innocent civilians and thousands of ordinary Iraqi soldiers and conscripts. The Northern Ireland parties opposed to the war in Iraq should not have afforded Messrs Bush and Blair the kind of cover they were seeking. That the Taoiseach has reported no conclusion demonstrates that last Tuesday was a war summit and a cynical photo opportunity.Working class people in Northern Ireland are, I believe, for the most part heartily fed up with the manoeuvrings and brinkmanship of the political parties. Based as they are on one side or other  of the sectarian divide, ordinary people are increasingly alienated from the political in-fighting, the horse trading, the posturing and the grand standing because issues of fundamental concern in working class communities are being sidelined, and are not receiving the attention they need and the discussion that is deserved and required. While the Assembly is suspended the British Government and its agents in Northern Ireland are making far-reaching decisions with immense consequences for ordinary people down the line.The privatisation of many crucial public services is being pushed through. Currently, hundreds of water service workers in the North are threatened with redundancies as that service is being prepared for privatisation. The Government is planning to bring in a water tax and a figure of £400 sterling has been mentioned. Housing continues to be a huge problem and poverty continues to be a major problem. Meanwhile we are faced with political parties based on one side or other of the sectarian divide and the institutionalisation of sectarianism which the structures of the Good Friday Agreement enshrine.The reality is that new elections in those circumstances will further polarise the situation. Therefore, we need a new departure in political life in the North. We need the paramilitaries disbanded. They have never added an ounce of progress on any side to the lives or the welfare of working class people. We need the apparatus of State repression disbanded as well and we need the people who represent concerns on the ground, trade union activists, community activists, anti-war activists and young people, to begin the process of building a real peace process and a new political movement that can go across the sectarian divide and offer a real and a radical alternative to the problems that face Catholic and Protestant working class people equally. That is how a solution will be found to the problem on this island.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I thank the party leaders for their helpful and constructive statements and express my appreciation to the House in general for its continuing interest in, and support for, the Government's work in regard to the peace process.As the Taoiseach outlined in his statement, the past six months has been a particularly intensive period in the collective task of fully implementing all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. The suspension of the devolved institutions last October was related to a crisis of trust. As a result of a number of destabilising incidents and allegations, many Unionists no longer had the required confidence that republicans were committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Equally, the Ulster Unionist Council of 21 September created doubts as to the commitment of that party to core elements of the Agreement, including the operation of inclusive institutions.In their statement of 14 October last, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister recognised this mutual deficit of confidence could only be addressed by substantially advancing the transition to exclusively peaceful and democratic means and, at the same time, ensuring the operation of stable and inclusive political institutions. It was our joint analysis that an incremental approach of gradually moving forward would no longer be sufficient to achieve these objectives. Five years after the Agreement, the deficit of confidence was such that a more radical and ambitious approach was required.We needed to fast-forward the implementation of the outstanding aspects of the Agreement. Quantum leaps were required or, in the words of the Prime Minister Mr. Blair, acts of completion that brought closure to all outstanding commitments under the Agreement. This was a bold and ambitious approach that challenged all sides – the Governments, the parties and the paramilitary organisations.In dialogue with the pro-Agreement parties, the two Governments have undertaken a huge amount of work auditing the progress that has been made over the past five years and bench-marking it against the objectives and undertakings of the Agreement. This work was undertaken in various formats; bilateral, trilateral and round-table meetings – implementation group meetings as they were known where all the parties who have an interest in this matter in terms of the full implementation of this Agreement – were held over several months to develop a broad consensus of the kind of steps that were required to constitute an overall acts of completion package.From these discussions, two things were clear. First, that the question of the transition to exclusively democratic means was a key issue of confidence that had to be resolved if the institutions were to be sustainable. Second, that it could only be addressed in the enabling context of the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement.I pay tribute to all of the pro-Agreement parties for the contributions they made to our collective endeavours over recent months. While each of the parties has different views, needs and pressures, all of them share a common determination to see the Agreement succeed. Each of them, irrespective of size, has made a distinct and valuable contribution to the progress that has been made.I place on record my appreciation of the quality of the working relationship that currently exists between both Governments. A key enabling condition of the progress made in recent years has been the solidity of the partnership between both Governments. That is most clearly reflected in the political partnership between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister. They negotiated the Agreement as colleagues but are seeking to deliver it as friends. The leadership and commitment they have both shown has been vital in overcoming the various obstacles to implementation.The strength of the partnership is reflected in the constructive working relationships between the two Governments at all levels. The progress we have made in recent years has been built on the foundation work of successive Taoisigh and Governments over several decades. This Government is very appreciative of those constructive foundations and of the bi-partisan support in this House for our ongoing work.The discussions at Hillsborough on 3 and 4 March between the two Governments and the parties were very productive and a good deal of progress was made across a range of issues including policing, criminal justice, security normalisation, ending paramilitary activity and the human rights and equality agendas. Progress on all of these issues is central to achieving a normalised society. While there was a shared understanding between the parties on the broad import of this work, more time was required for reflection and internal consultation. Accordingly, both Governments agreed to return to Hillsborough in early April. For related reasons, the Assembly elections were also postponed by 4 weeks from 1 May to 29 May.Arising out of the progress made, the Governments have now developed a comprehensive package of proposals which, we believe, could provide a solid basis for the necessary acts of completion. However, for this package to have the desired political impact, it must be clear that the consequential acts of completion will have the required confidence-building impact. That is why the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister laid such stress last Thursday on obtaining the required clarity and certainty.Assuming that sufficient responses are forthcoming, it must be equally clear that the Ulster Unionist leadership will positively embrace the package as a reasonable and sustainable basis for participation in inclusive government. The stop-start phase of the operation of the Agreement must be seen to be over. As the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said on Saturday, fulfilling the promise and potential of the Good Friday Agreement is a collective responsibility.Last Thursday was the fifth anniversary of the Agreement. I know this House shared the disappointment of many that it did not prove possible for the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister to return to Northern Ireland on that day to publish their proposals. However, there would have been little purpose in doing so if publication did not achieve the quality of response that would have the potential to break the current impasse. The two Governments, therefore, judged it necessary to defer publication until there was sufficient clarification about the nature of those responses.Some encouraging progress has been made since then. The Government has been keeping in close touch with the parties. All the pro-Agreement parties are to be commended for the responsible way they have dealt with the situation in recent days.As the House will be aware, the two Governments sought clarification on a number of issues arising from the text of an IRA statement which we received on Sunday night. That clarification was received last night and is being studied by both Governments. The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have discussed the matter by phone and will have an opportunity to consider it further when they meet at the European Council in Athens tomorrow.Given the fluidity and sensitivity of the current situation, the House will appreciate that I am not at liberty to discuss the substance of the clarifications being sought. However, they are related to achieving together with the publication of the Governments' proposals, a political environment in which confidence and trust can be recreated leading into the Assembly elections on 29 May. The two Governments have been working around the clock in recent days to finalise work on these issues. If we can make the judgment that sufficient clarification of positions has been obtained, we will publish our full proposals.The recent efforts of the two Governments have been greatly assisted by the support and encouragement received from our friends in the United States. President's Bush's meeting with the Governments and the parties last Tuesday in Hillsborough was a powerful reaffirmation of US support for the process. Not only has President Bush lent the power and prestige of his office to support our efforts, he has also given us the diplomatic skills of Ambassador Richard Haass who has been an assiduous facilitator of progress. As Deputies will be aware, Ambassador Haass has again spent the past few days in Northern Ireland meeting the parties, encouraging them to go the extra mile and remaining in close touch with the two Governments.Whatever happens in the next few weeks, the people of Northern Ireland will go to the polls on 29 May to elect a new Assembly. Our immediate priority is to create a strong pro-Agreement platform for those elections. The people of Northern Ireland want to see devolved government by local Ministers that are accountable to them. Since the Agreement, they have seen devolved government in operation. They know it works and that it delivers tangible benefits for its citizens.We must redouble our efforts in the coming days to ensure that, on 29 May, the people of Northern Ireland have before them an Agreement that is in full working order and that they have the credible prospect of electing members to an Assembly and Executive that are sustainable and that will again deliver them good government. In that scenario, I believe the people will remain constant to those parties who had the courage to commit themselves to the vision of the Agreement, who believed that, through partnership, Northern Ireland could be made a better place, who were prepared to take risks to light candles of hope rather than smugly curse the darkness.No doubt some of those who have always been opposed to the Agreement will argue that the current difficulties are a validation of their argument for an alternative approach. They argue that a new agreement can be negotiated that will attract the clear majority support of both Unionists and Nationalists. Apart from blithely ignoring the fact that the Good Friday Agreement attracted the solemn endorsement of 85% on the island, they have failed to indicate how people in Northern Ireland, particularly Nationalists, could be persuaded to depart from the core principles, values and safeguards of the Agreement.Do they seriously believe that key concepts of the Agreement, such as inclusive government and balanced North-South institutions, could be renegotiated? If so, I am not sure who the negotiating partners on the Nationalist side would be. As the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said on 14 October, the Agreement remains the template for political progress and is the only sustainable basis for a fair and honourable accommodation between Unionists and Nationalists, loyalists and republicans.When President Bush was in Hillsborough, he urged us to "achieve the Agreement, because it will have an effect beyond Northern Ireland". Despite the occasional frustrations we might feel, Northern Ireland is an encouraging case-study of conflict resolution. Compared to some other regions, Northern Ireland is a model of hope and encouragement for many areas of conflict in the globe.In the coming days and weeks we must seize the opportunity to fully secure gains that have been made over the past five years; to consolidate the many achievements that the Agreement has brought us; and to translate our peace process into a peace settlement.That is what our current work is about, why it is important that everyone can move forward together in mutual confidence and why, as we approach another Good Friday, we must finish the job begun five years ago of achieving a fresh start to relationships within and between these islands.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	397	At the outset, I wish to again state, on behalf of myself and my Government colleagues, our serious concern at the national strike action taken by public health doctors in pursuit of a 30% pay claim. I strongly urge the IMO to cease this unwarranted action, particularly in view of the recent agreement on a new national pay deal, Sustaining Progress, and to participate in the processes which are available to resolve this dispute.I also wish to record that this claim has been lodged in relation to the current duties and responsibilities of these doctors and is separate to any pay increase that the Irish Medical Organisation has indicated that it will demand for the implementation of changed working practices that may be required in the future.It is important to clarify the background to the current dispute, especially in view of the variety of selective historical accounts that are being circulated.The regional public health function was established in 1994, comprising the grades of director of public health, specialist in public health, senior area medical officers and area medical officers. A full review of the public health function commenced in 1999 with the report of the public health review group, the Brennan group, issuing in April 2002. The IMO were equal partners and co-owners of this review process. The HSEA, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards accept the recommendations contained in the Brennan report. The report does, however, reflect the diverging views between the parties on the issue of consultant status for public health doctors. The chairman's role was that of facilitator to the working party and not that of an arbitrator. His comments in relation to the status of directors and specialists were no more than a personal view and as such had not the status of a recommendation.The only recommendations contained in the report were on those issues on which the parties were in agreement. It should also be noted that the Brennan report acknowledged that there  might be a need to revisit its recommendations following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy, entitled Quality and Fairness, and the primary care strategy. Both of these strategies, and the forthcoming report on the audit of structures in the health service by Prospectus, will have significant implications for the future role of public health doctors and, as such, must be taken fully into account in any negotiations process.In 2002, following extensive consideration of a detailed submission by the IMO the Public Service Benchmarking Body recommended increases for public health doctors ranging from 2.5% for a specialist in public health medicine to 14.2% for a director of public health medicine. In making these recommendations, the benchmarking body was determining the rate of pay which should apply to the various public health posts based on their duties and responsibilities as of 30 June 2002. It is also important to note that these duties and responsibilities have not changed in the interim. The benchmarking body did acknowledge that it was not in a position to take account of the issues raised by the Public Health Review Group in relation to the restructuring of public health service provision.The health strategy envisages a population health division being established in each health board, incorporating such areas as public health and health promotion units. These developments will obviously be influenced by the outcome of the restructuring proposals which are currently being finalised and must be central to any consideration of the future role and responsibilities of public health doctors. I feel it is necessary to reflect on the key issues at the heart of this industrial relations dispute.The Irish Medical Organisation, the representative organisation for public health doctors, has lodged a claim for a 30% pay increase, in advance of any discussion or agreement on future changes in work practices arising from the negotiations on the Brennan report or that will be required under the health and primary care strategies or the Prospectus report. This claim is in addition to increases of up to 14% which have been approved by the Public Service Benchmarking Body and the 7% increase which will be paid under the terms of the new national pay agreement, Sustaining Progress.Contrary to IMO suggestions that the Department of Health and Children did not favour or support the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, it should be noted that Department officials, as part of the management team, have attended a number of LRC hearings with the IMO. In the context of these discussions, management made a substantial offer to the IMO in an attempt to resolve this dispute. A cumulative increase of up to 25%, inclusive of the increases approved under benchmarking, has been rejected by the IMO. On top of this amount the public health doctors will receive a further 7% under the  new national agreement. In monetary terms these increases would translate into very substantial amounts.The salary of directors of public health will increase by €29,000, from €82,000 to €111,000 per annum, a cumulative increase of 35.39%. The salary of public health specialists will increase by €17,000, from €78,000 to €95,000 per annum, a cumulative increase of 21.52%. The salary of senior area medical officers will increase by between €17,000 and €19,000, from between €55,000 and €63,000 to between €72,000 and €82,000 per annum, a cumulative increase of 30.41 %. The salary of area medical officers will increase by between €11,000 and €13,000, from between €48,000 and €56,000 to between €59,000 and €69,000 per annum, a cumulative increase of 22.11 %.I put it to the House that increases of this magnitude do not warrant industrial action, let alone a national strike. I am sure it will not go unnoticed that the potential increases themselves are in excess of the average annual industrial wage. Unfortunately, I am left with the impression that the IMO has a preference for strike action rather than mediation or resolution. It is unprecedented in the history of Irish industrial relations for any union to have refused to participate in proceedings in the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court in the weeks leading up to the strike.Both the Health Service Employers Agency and my Department have written to the Irish Medical Organisation indicating their opposition to the current action and requesting the reconvening of talks at the Labour Relations Commission or a referral to the Labour Court. A management team, comprising officials from my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the health boards, held negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in the Labour Relations Commission on a number of occasions in recent months. I understand that the HSEA has accepted an invitation from the Labour Relations Commission to resume discussions and has urged the IMO to participate in this process.I have previously requested the Irish Medical Organisation to return to these negotiations or to accept my invitation to attend the Labour Court. Both of these offers have been refused by the IMO in the weeks leading up to the strike. I now again request the IMO to reconsider its position in this matter in an attempt to resolve the current impasse. Further ministerial intervention at this stage is neither appropriate nor necessary in view of the processes available to the IMO through normal industrial relations channels.Talking about industrial relations practices and protocols brings me to another worrying aspect of this dispute – the difficulty in obtaining agreement to or clarification of the IMO arrangements for the provision of emergency cover by public health doctors during their strike. It is management's firm belief that the IMO requirement that requests for emergency cover should be chan nelled by health board chief executive officers to the IMO national strike committee rather than being dealt with at local/regional level is most unsatisfactory. The refusal of the IMO to meet with management to discuss and clarify issues which arose at a previous meeting on emergency cover is unprecedented. Similarly, the weekend statement by the IMO that there would be further serious curtailment of the already severely limited emergency cover arrangements, the refusal to exempt any director of public health or the director of the national disease surveillance centre or to exclude the activation of major emergency plans from their restrictive requirements raises serious ethical, professional and public safety issues and calls into question the organisation's motives in taking this approach.Against this backdrop, arrangements have been made to provide contingency planning arrangements at all levels within the Irish health care system. A national contingency planning group will assist and advise on any national issues in relation to emergency responses. This will cover issues related to the expert committees on SARS and biological threats. A national incident room has been established within the Department to liaise with the health boards and health authority and to monitor developments on a daily basis. Advice notices have been placed in the national press and these will be reviewed and reissued if appropriate.The medical division within the Department of Health and Children is providing an advisory service to the broader health system and meeting international reporting requirements to bodies such as the World Health Organisation and the European Union. In relation to the issue of SARS, I established an expert group in March to monitor the situation as it developed and to provide advice in relation to the measures required to deal with this syndrome. Prior to this strike, the national disease surveillance centre, NDSC, and the Department of Health and Children developed protocols and guidance for hospitals and health professionals which described the syndrome and provided advice on how suspect cases should be managed. In addition, information for the public and health care workers as well as guidance for aircraft cabin and aircraft cleaning staff has also been provided.The health service agencies will continue to monitor developments in this area in line with the guidelines issued. In that regard, I have been advised that the Health Service Employers Agency has again written to the IMO in relation to emergency cover arrangements and, specifically, those applying to SARS. The HSEA has requested the IMO to restore the public health input in relation to SARS to normal levels, as an exceptional matter, and in recognition of the unique nature of the illness. A reply is awaited from the IMO in this regard.Each health board and authority has nominated a senior official to co-ordinate contingency arrangements at regional level and details in this  regard have been circulated to all health agencies and to the IMO. Local senior management are overseeing the arrangements necessary to ensure effective co-ordinating and response at local level.I will finish by again urging the IMO and public health doctors, both collectively and individually, to reconsider the course of action which they have undertaken by initiating this unnecessary strike, to return to the Labour Relations Commission to continue negotiations or to seek a joint referral to the Labour Court. I assure them that the Health Service Employers Agency is ready and willing to resume this process at the earliest opportunity.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I thank the Minister for answering these questions on this important issue. I am not here to negotiate on behalf of public health doctors or to get involved in a union dispute. However, in fairness to the public health doctors, the Minister's statement regarding the new national pay deal—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Deputy, you may ask a question but you may not make a statement.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I realise that. The Minister has referred to the new national pay deal, Sustaining Progress. However, these issues precede this dispute and have nothing to do with it.These 300 doctors do very unglamorous work. They are not brain surgeons. They are dedicated public servants and mostly women, in fact. They did not go on strike on a whim. This dispute has been boiling up for a long time. It is unfair to say they would not go to the Labour Court when they offered to go to the Labour Court in the past. At that time the Department said there was no need to go to the Labour Court but that it would deal with them. The Department did not deal with them. This is the final straw for the public health doctors.Does the Minister agree that Ireland is now the weak link in the chain of disease protection because of the absence of a 24 hour rostered service? Our neighbour, Northern Ireland, has expressed concern to the Minister's Department at the gap in disease protection. Does the Minister not agree that we have spent a fortune on tribunals of inquiry to establish why our record is so bad in managing infectious diseases and that the cost of the 24 hour roster would be minute in comparison, given the exposure to infection that could result from not putting it in place?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Sustaining Progress is both relevant and applicable to this dispute. It is my opinion that the IMO is in breach of Sustaining Progress, only a matter of weeks after it was ratified. There are specific provisions in Sustaining Progress in relation to how industrial disputes should be resolved. There is even a specific section dealing with health.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	402	This dispute precedes Sustaining Progress. It is irrelevant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Sustaining Progress is binding on all signatories to the agreement since the date of ratification. Congress has been advised of that. All parties agreed, for example, that the agreement "precludes strikes or other forms of industrial action by trade unions, employees or employers in respect of any matters covered by this agreement, where the employer or trade union concerned is acting in accordance with the provisions of this agreement". The agreement goes on to refer to utilising the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and avoiding industrial action.The position is that the Labour Court is not being used. We have suggested to the IMO that we have a joint referral to the Labour Court. The HSEA has been involved in that process within the Labour Relations Commission, is still anxious to resume it, has been invited to go back and has accepted that invitation.I ask Deputies to reflect on the figure of €29,000, which is the offer on the table. That increase is due, yet people are on strike. I do not think that is acceptable or justifiable. It is well above the average industrial wage.The grades below that will not get €29,000 but will get the substantial increases of up to €19,000 that I outlined earlier. These are substantial monetary increases by any standards. In that context it is reasonable to say that we should fully exploit the available industrial relations machinery to resolve disputes of this kind.I accept Deputy Olivia Mitchell's point about a gap in public health provision as a result of the strike.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	404	There was a gap prior to the strike.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	405	That is an unfortunate consequence of the action that has been taken.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Fundamental issues remain to be negotiated arising from the Brennan report, not least out of hours cover and related logistics. Those matters are for further negotiation.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Does the Minister not agree that wailing about what might have been is pointless? Does he accept that public health doctors are on strike and sooner or later a deal must be struck? Sooner is a lot better than later in circumstances where there are ongoing risks of outbreaks of routine infectious diseases such as measles, meningitis and the winter vomiting bug and the new threat posed by SARS. Does the Minister not feel that he would be better engaged in ensuring there is a formula whereby people can go to the LRC? Indications have already come from the IMO how that can be done. Does the Minister not  accept that the people involved are the least militant one could imagine and that their patience has simply run out after many years of delay and bad faith on the part of the Department of Health and Children? It is important that the industrial relations machinery is put into action and that it sorts out the issues but the Minister has a part to play in that rather than bewailing the IMO.Who is providing the public health expertise to ensure any outbreak is contained, monitored and tracked and that any issues arising are dealt with? Is the Department taking responsibility and does it have the expertise to do so? Who is providing a strategy to deal with SARS as an issue for the Special Olympics? We all welcome the fact that the Special Olympics are taking place in Ireland but it involves 35,000 people travelling here. Is the Department of Health and Children advising these delegations of our poor public health infrastructure? Is it ensuring that all measures are being taken to prevent and contain the spread of SARS in Ireland?Does the Minister accept that there is a stark contrast between the approach of the Department of Agriculture and Food to the foot and mouth epidemic and the lack of effort made by the Department of Health and Children to ensure industrial action did not happen to begin with? People find it hard to understand why infectious diseases among animals get more attention than those among humans.Will the Minister comment on the statement from the Minister for Finance that there will be no money forthcoming to resolve the strike?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The medical division of the Department, under the chief medical officer, and through a network of committees in each health board, is dealing with issues that arise in the public health domain. The advice I have received comes from the medical division of my Department and the expert committee continues to meet on SARS. I hope that no one would use the Special Olympics to gain leverage in the dispute.The World Health Organisation offers advice on these issues and the expert committee at a recent meeting noted that, as of now, the WHO has not issued travel restrictions or quarantine orders on individuals from the affected areas. That could change and with the Special Olympics starting in the latter half of June we will keep that under review.The national expert committee reports to the European Union and the World Health Organisation and takes advice from the WHO. We have followed all of the recommendations to the letter from the WHO about travel restrictions, issuing notices and warnings to people and issuing protocols to hospitals and doctors about dealing with SARS in Ireland. All of that has happened under the expert committee that I established after the notification of the outbreak of SARS in China and other affected areas. We are keeping the issue under review and will be guided by the World Health Organisation. This is, however,  such an exceptional public health threat that it should not come under the remit of the strike. It is a sufficiently grave matter that it should be exempt from industrial action. I support the HSEA in its communication today to the IMO on that.I am not wailing about anything, my speech laid out the facts. The substantive offer on the table does not merit industrial action. There is a tendency for Opposition Deputies during a strike to say that the Government, Minister or Department should roll over and give whatever is on the table. The Department must protect taxpayers.

There are increases of between €17,000 and €19,000 for senior area medical officers and €13,000 for area medical officers. Most industrial workers would not get anything near that in an increase. There is a €29,000 increase for the directors of public health. All four grades are undertaking industrial action and those figures do not justify that action. Any agreements will have to be paid for out of the budget we have been allocated.

In many ways they are the Cinderellas of the health service and it is wrong to approach this by engaging in sabre rattling, as the Minister has done this evening. I understand positions are entrenched at the beginning but we must negotiate and find a solution.The Minister talked about a cumulative increase of up to 25% then mentioned numerous times that those involved would receive €29,000 of an increase. Over what period will that take place?The Minister outlined in this speech that the IMO stated at the weekend that there would be a further serious curtailment of the already sever ely limited emergency cover arrangements. That is causing disquiet. He then said we are adequately covered for SARS. How can the Minister square those two statements? It appears the health service has contingency plans in place. However, does the Minister agree that without the public health doctors, these plans are severely curtailed? Does he share my anxiety that if there is a SARS outbreak the country will not be adequately covered because of the strike and that therefore the onus is on him to resolve it as quickly as possible?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I did not go on strike.

I am not sabre rattling, but I have made the point that the health boards through the HSEA are available for discussions and negotiation. Industrial relations machinery is in place to deal with this issue.I have been Minister for Health and Children for a little more than three years. In my first months in office I had to deal with threatened strike action by junior doctors. It went to the wire. The following year GPs were involved in unrest and this year, public health doctors have taken strike action. It appears that the first recourse in these disputes is strike action.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	424	They are taking strike action after nine years.

A substantive offer has been made and in the circumstances, industrial action is not justified. The public health doctors should fully utilise the available industrial relations machinery. Sustaining Progress is strong on the need to avoid, if at all possible, industrial action in the health sector and on the obligation by all sides to fully exploit and utilise the industrial relations machinery. There is an opportunity for a joint referral to the Labour Court, which the HSEA is willing to take and I appeal to the IMO to join the HSEA in referring this issue to the Labour Court for a decision.

This information will enable us to make a proper judgment on the increases.I appeal to the Minister to exercise every initiative to secure an early resolution of this dispute. What steps does he propose to take to address the major deficit in public health alert cover, in the so-called out of hours periods covering evenings, weekends, bank holidays, and so on What steps does he propose to take in the context of the global threat posed by the SARS virus, especially in view of the significant visitor numbers expected over the course of the impending Special Olympics?The Minister said he does not wish to see the Special Olympics used as lever by any interest group. However, there is a growing and genuinely held fear throughout the country that there is an impending threat to public health. People want to know the steps taken by the Minster and his Department to address this aspect.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	430	A question to the Minister, please.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Does the Minister accept that infection does not close down at the Department's closing time of 5 p.m.? Does he also accept that given the increased threat of bio-terrorism and increased mobility in and out of the country, it is lunacy that we do not have the potential to instantly erect a ring of steel around the country on a 24 hour basis, such as we were able to do in the case of the foot and mouth disease outbreak?Apparently, two nurses are undergoing testing for the SARS virus at their homes. Will the Minister indicate who is monitoring this? He indicated that officials from the health boards have been nominated to act. While I am sure they will do their best, they are not technically or professionally qualified to engage in the necessary surveillance, monitoring, guidance and management of emergent diseases. In view of this, what measures have been put in place?

Does he also accept that there is genuine concern with regard to the  Special Olympics and that nobody is raising it for underhand reasons? I represent the town of Bray, which is expecting and hoping to welcome the Chinese delegation. I do not get the impression that sufficient information has been distributed in terms of ensuring that the Special Olympics can proceed and that those involved can feel secure that everything is being done in the proper manner.

Does he consider it is merely a question of greed?The WHO has described the SARS virus as one of seven pathogens with the potential to cause the next black death. If it is that serious, does the Minister accept it is his duty to resolve this problem as soon as possible?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Some of the questions have been asked a second or third time. With regard to the Special Olympics, I have made the point that in view of the world-wide nature and scale of the threat posed by the SARS virus, we are guided by the advice of experts in the WHO. The Special Olympics are due to commence next June. In the meantime the expert committee will continue to take advice from the WHO. Closer to the date we may have to make decisions on the best way to proceed. At present, it is too early to make definitive decisions on that aspect.The WHO is taking this crisis very seriously and we owe it a significant debt of gratitude for the manner in which it has addressed this public health threat. To date, it has not issued any recommendations on travel restrictions or quarantine arrangements in respect of those travelling from the affected areas. We will continue to work with the WHO.I understand the expert committee has been informed that the alleged cases referred to yesterday are not being notified to the WHO as SARS cases as they do not fit the diagnostic criteria necessary to report them. That is welcome news. The expert committee is monitoring the SARS virus. Prior to the strike action, those involved in public health informed through the National Disease Surveillance Centre, gave advice and produced high quality and important work. There is now a deficiency in this area and I am very concerned about it. The HSEA has contacted the IMO requesting that the SARS virus be exempted from strike action, given the gravity of the issue in terms of a public health threat, across the world and to this country.Regarding Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, in terms of the directors of public health the levels start at about 82,000 and will go up to 111,000 over the next 20 months. The number of public health specialists will increase from 78,000 to 95,000, of senior area medical health personnel from 19,000 to 82,000 and of area medical officers from 59,000 to 69,000.

I wish to share time with Deputies Connolly, James Breen, Finian McGrath, Gormley and Ó Caoláin. This motion was on last Wednesday's Order Paper, but it got nowhere because the Government did not take it up. Thanks to the co-operation of my Independent colleagues, this motion has been moved on behalf of the Technical Group and has the support of all Opposition Members.I wish to know what the Government's policy on cancer care funding is. Where is the priority to fund proper prevention and care regarding a disease which affects one in three people and kills one in four? We are still reading about the Taoiseach and the national stadium and we have heard the Taoiseach say he wants world-class sports facilities. Why can we not have world-class cancer care facilities with European standards? Cancer care is certainly not a Government priority and it is no wonder we are lagging behind in the statistics on death rates from the disease.The Government gave sporting organisations €161 million in 2002 while only €23.5 million was provided for the development of cancer services. I do not begrudge sporting organisations but I begrudge the small amount given to cancer care development. We need proper funding to make up the deficit between what is possible and what is there at the moment. The figures are shocking. The latest statistics from the 1999 national cancer registry show that 20,000 people, or one in three of the population, is being diagnosed with cancer which means that every hour two more families will receive the terrible news that a member has cancer.As early as 2015, the incidence of many cancers will double. The numbers being diagnosed with breast cancer will increase by 43% over the next 12 years which is a shocking figure. Are we prepared to tolerate this doubling in the numbers in light of current resources? There is concern given the high rates of morbidity and mortality in our national cancer registry compared to the EU average. There are also variations in those rates within the country. According to the recently published national cancer registry, there has been no reduction in the death rate from cancer, in the large numbers of people receiving no cancer specific treatment or in the large numbers of elderly people who receive no treatment at all. The large numbers of patients who live in areas not facilitated by radiotherapy services are less likely to receive treatment, while the likelihood of receiving scientifically-based treatment is a lottery which depends on where one lives. That is unacceptable.I was always told that prevention was better than cure which is why I threatened to march on the Oireachtas in regard to BreastCheck. Within 48 hours of marching, a commitment to extend  BreastCheck was given by the Minister for Health and Children, but we are still waiting for the Minister for Finance to confirm the €6 million necessary for the capital roll-out this year. The decision to roll-out BreastCheck in one part of the country rather than another meant that 195 women died unnecessarily in the south and west. A wealth of international evidence was available which proved that mortality rates from breast cancer could be cut by 20% to 30% through a breast check programme. It is wrong for the Department of Finance effectively to control the health service and I call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Taoiseach to confirm the availability of the €6 million needed for the capital roll-out of BreastCheck this year. It is unacceptable and a recipe for further cutbacks for the health boards to be expected to take the money from their existing budgets.A national programme for the prevention of cancer of the cervix was promised in 1999, but we are still waiting for it to extend beyond a single health board area. Given that in England the death rate from this cancer is being cut by 7% every year, it is a national disgrace that we do not have a country-wide screening programme. Cervical screening is a simple test. Even in the cases of those who have it done or can pay for the service, a waiting period of 28 weeks applies which constitutes another cancer lottery. It costs lives.The recently formed cancer care line aims to ensure that preventative services are put in place while demanding equity in the system. Cancer care apartheid exists in this country and its most notable example is access to radiotherapy services. Last week I received a telephone call to say that a bed was available for a patient of mine who had died four days before. That was disgraceful. Here was a man who had been told he needed treatment and expected to get it, but who died waiting for a letter to arrive, which never came. If one has money, one can have these services tomorrow. If that man had money and was insured by BUPA or the VHI, he would have received the care. People are voting with their feet and nearly half of the population are members of those insurance schemes. If one lives in Ballymun or Ballydehob, one will fall victim to the same cancer care apartheid. If one does not have money, one could die waiting for treatment as did my unfortunate patient. I am not saying he would have been cured, but he would have been helped. He was recommended for the treatment and he should have received it.The three modalities of treatment are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but they cannot benefit someone who lives a few hundred miles from the treatment centre. It is no wonder that our cancer statistics are as they are when people have to travel so far. It is no wonder we wallow at the bottom of the European league table when only 16% of those who require radiotherapy actually get it compared to the 50% to 60% who should get it. This is a disgraceful postcode lottery  in which whether one lives or dies depends on where one lives. Government policy is deciding whether people live or die.I was in Waterford recently to speak at a demonstration. I discussed the radiotherapy unit in Galway which should be rolled out in July but which will not treat a single patient until 2006 because the Department of Health and Children has not given the go-ahead for recruitment, a process which can take up to a year and a half to complete. According to leaks and the last edition of The Sunday Tribune, which speaks authoritatively on the subject, there will be no radiotherapy units in Waterford and Limerick which is a fiasco. It does not make humanitarian, medical or economic sense. Science has moved on and countries like Ireland with a dispersed population have discovered local radiotherapy which is something we should do too as it provides cheap, effective treatment. A patient would receive a scan locally, his or her information would be passed to St. Luke's and a treatment plan would passed back within hours. The patient could receive radiotherapy locally. Mothers would not have to be away from their babies for five weeks. It is a cost effective option and Deputy McCreevy should note that in the case of these day patients there would be no bed costs and no long transport costs. The system works. People spend 12 hours travelling to receive five minutes radiation and it costs them hundreds of hours to get one hour's worth of treatment. That is ridiculous and non-cost effective. The report outlined in The Sunday Tribune should be rejected as old hat. For a fraction of the cost we could have strategically-located radiotherapy units with CATscanners, radiotherapy machines and staff.They say we need 38 machines which they wish to locate centrally. I welcome the mention of Galway, but I do not understand why a service should be centralised when that will fail to make it easier for people to access it. Access to radiotherapy will not be improved by this measure. At the moment ten machines are available to the public which treat 350 people per machine per year, or 3,500 people in total. Annually, 9,000 patients will require radiotherapy. There is a requirement for cross-Border co-operation to ensure that those in the north-east can access cancer treatment services at Derry.I calculate that the South-Eastern Health Board spent €28.2 million in 12 years on transport and accommodation costs for radiotherapy patients. It costs this amount of money to transport people to receive this treatment, yet for half the money, the same service could be provided locally. It makes great humanitarian, medical and economic sense. There are models in Norway, Truro and the Mater private hospital. The report states that, by 2015 and possibly 2010, the population of Waterford and the south-east will be such that the service will be needed. That is for four linear accelerators, but it would be done immediately with a unit of two.Government policy is deciding whether people live or die and this has been confirmed by the National Cancer Registry report. We do not have enough oncology beds, nurses and staff. There are eight radiation oncologists for the country compared with 12 in Belfast alone and 157 in Holland. Given that Holland's population is four times ours, that would mean we should have 40 radiation oncologists. Instead, we have eight, which is a disgrace.It is time to end cancer care apartheid. It is time for the Government to put its money where its mouth is on cancer care and give a definite commitment to multi-annual funding for cancer care. Health apartheid should be ended and Galway given the go-ahead to begin recruiting staff.The radiotherapy report was supposed to have been made available years ago and yet we still receive leaks about it. We can read about it in The Sunday Tribune. It is typical that we must wait so long for a report that means so much to many people and when the lack of a proper service costs many lives. It is typical of how the Government prioritises cancer, which is terrible and shocking. The final irony is that the report supposedly recommends another report to decide where to locate the second centralised unit in Dublin. Does it make sense to you, a Cheann Comhairle? It does not make sense to me.We need to make cancer care a central priority. How can Ireland's families have a future if we are to be affected by a lack of funding for a service that is not delivering? We need a realistic budget for cancer care so that Ireland's families have a future and that, when people contract cancer, which one in three of us will, at least they can be assured of the best possible care.

The National Cancer Registry's recent report indicates that large numbers of cancer patients, especially elderly ones, do not receive any cancer treatment. By the time the patients are listed for treatment, in many cases they have passed beyond the eternal veil and the matter of the treatment is academic. This represents a type of creeping euthanasia and leads to the suspicion that there may be an acceptable level of cancer deaths since no clear vision or goal for a cancer control system appears to be evident.On the one hand, those with the wherewithal can purchase the treatment. The less affluent citizens must settle for joining the lottery as to whether they receive treatment, appropriate or otherwise. When cancer care policy is driven by administrative priorities, it cannot work, the public good suffers as a consequence and administrators are driven deeper into a defensive position. However, as long as the policies are ideas-driven, they are on the offensive and can work.The three wise men in the report pinpointed the black hole in health spending resources when  they reported a 40% increase in senior executive administrative posts in the three years between 1997 and 2000. In the past two years 120 different reports have been commissioned, most of which will be consigned to the waste basket.The most recent of these was a consultancy report on Monaghan General Hospital which took three people eight days to complete at a cost of €60,000. This will be confined to the waste paper basket – all signs of it are there – because it is an independent report and recommends the restoration of services to a local hospital in a rural area.It appears we are being hauled back more than 30 years to the situation envisaged by the Fitzgerald report of a country with only 12 to 14 general hospitals or so-called centres of excellence from which patients, including cancer patients, would be returned to local hospitals as step-down facilities – in effect, sent home to die. Many of the designated regional cancer hospitals have no oncology wards and find it necessary to treat patients in ordinary general wards.Comhairle na nOspidéal recommended a maximum of 300 patients per consultant annually, yet according to Cork University Hospital, we have an average of 800 per consultant. This results in consultants being overworked.The British Medical Journal has published research showing that, since a breast cancer screening programme was introduced in Italy in 1990, fewer Italian women have had mastectomies. In Ireland, BreastCheck, which is confined to women in the eastern, midland and north-eastern areas, plays a vital part in detecting nine cases of breast cancer per thousand and should be extended to all health board areas.The Government gave a clear commitment before the general election to provide a world class health service, not a Third World service, and that it would pump the necessary resources into tackling cancer. I call on the Government to honour that commitment and devote a realistic budget to an all-out assault on the cancer scourge.

We are continuously told about the amount of money spent on health. How much will be spent in future? The Minister allocates budgets to different health boards yet, when asked questions, fails to answer them and refers them back to health boards without asking where or on what the money is spent. The Minister comes from Cork, a great Gaelic football county, but he would make a great rugby player because he always kicks to touch.

#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Minister's allocation to cancer since 1997 has been very poor. Surely people suffering from this deadly disease deserve more. Imagine the trauma a person, especially one living in a remote area in the west, must feel on being told by his or her local general practitioner  or consultant that he or she has been diagnosed with cancer.I will deal with my county because there are many similar to it. Imagine getting into an ambulance in west Clare and travelling to Dublin and having to endure traffic gridlock in Ennis and Limerick. The stress caused by this is enormous. Surely we in the Mid-Western Health Board area are entitled to a radiotherapy unit in Limerick or Ennis. This would cost less and save lives.I call on the Government to provide immediate staffing for the unit in Galway and provide funding for a radiotherapy service in the mid-west as a matter of urgency. As cancer is rampant in the country, with one in every four affected, we cannot wait any longer. It will be cheaper to provide treatment on a regional basis and cut out the apparent cancer apartheid.As we are supposed to be cherished equally under the Constitution, it is only fair to expect the same treatment for all citizens, wherever in the country they live. However, this is not happening. In the year of people with disabilities, will the Minister look after the unfortunate people dying of cancer and provide the service necessary to keep them alive?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to speak on our group's motion on the lack of cancer services. Before I deal with the technical detail of the motion, I wish to emphasise that we have reached a cross-roads in society and our commitment to the provision of health care.Our health service – the taxpayers' and the people's health service – is in crisis and has major problems. It is sick but we have the opportunity to make it better. We can invest in it and radically change the structures or we can turn our backs and seek the easy way out. We can look for more tax cuts or look after our own people. It is as simple as that.It is not good enough for the Government to say it has thrown money at it for the past five years and nothing has happened. I do not accept that argument. Most of this was catch-up money for the years of neglect. Successive Ministers with responsibility for health have known this. The bottom line is that successive Governments have failed to take the tough decisions in the interests of all the people and a quality health service.We must face up to the waste and mismanagement of the health services. I have learned this from experience of the disability sector. We need reform, efficiency and, above all, more investment. That is the way forward and if we do not accept it society will go nowhere and we will fail our people as politicians.We must also look at our priorities. We have seen the poor budget for cancer care since 1997. Successive Governments have failed to extend the preventative cancer programmes to all our citizens. We demand that cancer services be funded properly by Government and we demand  equality of access to radiotherapy services for all our citizens. We must face up to the reality that we now have a cancer epidemic worse than the TB crisis of the past. Perhaps we now need another Noel Browne to tackle this issue head-on and to put people and patients first in delivering a service. We need this type of radical change and throwing our hands up in the air is not one of the options.Most people accept that the Government is failing to provide an adequate budget for cancer care, given that the disease affects one in three and kills one of four. This is the reality in Ireland in 2003 and we must now do something to solve this major crisis in our health system. In the near future, we should consider the idea of an all-party approach that will make health services a right for our people. This is the progressive way forward and, above all, it is in the interest of the people. As a start to this process, I urge all Deputies to support our motion.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	443	This is an extremely important motion and I have spoken on a number of occasions on this subject at the Committee on Health and Children. I am sure the Minister will be familiar with my line on the question of cancer.There are many green philosophers who have compared the global economy to a cancer cell. A cancer cell differs from other cells in that it knows no boundaries and grows and grows. This relates to our philosophy on economic growth because we have not recognised that there are limits to it and to the way in which our economy functions. We are living in a cancer culture and experiencing what other speakers have called a cancer epidemic. In our affluent society, we can continue to invest hugely in health and combating crime, yet the associated problems continue to worsen.We must ask ourselves some fundamental questions. Why do we continue to deal with the symptoms rather than the root causes? Green politics is really about going back to the root causes of our problems. The WHO has recently published its own cancer survey which suggests that cancer rates will increase by 50% over the next 20 years. This is quite horrendous. It tells us that this is because of our consumption of junk food, smoking and our sedentary lifestyles.One third of the predicted 15 million cases in 2020 could be prevented. Pervious speakers have said that prevention is better than cure, which is absolutely correct. We must ask what is causing the problem. The WHO has told us that 80% of cancers are environmentally linked. It goes back to the food we consume and all the fertilisers and pesticides we put on it, which have a cumulative effect. It goes back to the air we breath and we know that there is a higher incidence of cancer in urban areas in this country. It goes back to the water we drink. What do we put into our water? We put in aluminium sulphate and fluoride. Please do not tell me that this has no effect because one of the things that we are discovering is that  each person is not identical and that we all have different genetic predispositions. Therefore, some people are very sensitive. Some people can consume something and get away with it while others will develop cancer. Our knowledge in this area is growing all the time.The Minister can invest all the money he likes in the coming years but unless he considers what is causing cancer, he is on a loser. Consider the figures he has produced on the cumulative funding for cancer services. It is quite amazing how much money is being invested, yet the incidence of cancer is increasing. In 1997 the total amount the Minister invested was €8.135 million, and the figure for 2003 is €132.208 million. These are quite significant sums of money.As others have said, one in four will die from cancer. This statistic is no different from that pertaining to other developed countries, but it emphasises the need to make cancer services a priority within our health system. Figures from the National Cancer Registry show a marked increase in the number of cases of lung cancer among women in the past eight years. It is increasing by more than 3% per year. Among men, the rate of lung cancer is falling by about 1% per year. According to the director of the National Cancer Registry, Dr. Harry Comber, women will have the same rate of lung cancer by 2015 if the present trend continues. Compared with other EU states we have higher rates of cancer of the colon and melanoma, which is cancer of the skin. The incidence of cancer is generally higher in the ERHA area for both genders, particularly males.Why did 50% of patients with lung cancer receive no cancer-specific treatment and why were 57% of those with leukaemia not offered chemotherapy? The non-treatment rates for lung cancer in the US, for example, are in the 15% to 20% range. Two thirds of patients in the Republic with last-stage stomach cancer received no cancer-specific treatment. If they lived in the US, only one third of them would have been denied it.We know that smoking is the single most preventable cause of cancer. It is responsible for 30% of all cancers. Environment tobacco smoke or passive smoking, which is classified as a human carcinogen by the WHO, increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers by 25%. If the Government goes back to the root causes, my party and I will support its initiatives in this regard. Let us get very tough on smoking because it is a significant factor.The Committee on Health and Children has also dealt with the issue of breast cancer. BreastCheck provides free mammograms to women aged between 50 and 64 every two years. Let us look at the cause of breast cancer. In China, where people consume much less dairy product and eat more soya, they have eliminated or never even had a problem with breast cancer to the extent that we have had. Therefore, there are dietary factors involved.There is no point in the Minister saying that more and more is being invested. He will have to have a meeting within his Department to examine the issue. The strategy has failed and he will continue to throw good money after bad for many years to come unless he really takes a hard look at it. We in the Green Party would like to remove fluoride from water, for instance, because the statistics show that we have a higher rate of cancer as a result of its addition. Some people are sensitive to it while others may not be. I ask the Minister to rethink his strategy and to support the motion as put forward.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I commend Deputy Cowley and his fellow Independent Members for proposing this Private Members' motion. I fully support it and was glad to add my name to it, both as Sinn Féin leader in the Dáil and as health spokesperson.I attended and spoke at the recent demonstration in Dublin organised by the Cancer Care Alliance, which is calling for comprehensive, countrywide cancer services. It was quite remarkable that two days before the march, the Minister for Health and Children announced the extension of BreastCheck, a key demand of the campaign. I welcomed that announcement and look forward to seeing it implemented without delay, with extra funding being made available where necessary to speed the process. We all recognise that further delay will place more lives at risk.It has to be said, however, that the announcement of the extension on the eve of the demonstration speaks volumes of the piecemeal and band-aid approach of this Government to the health services. Why was this announcement not made six months ago or a year ago or two years ago, and why is it not in place now? Why should women in the west and south have to wait until 2005? How many women will suffer and die of cancer in the meantime as we await the extension of BreastCheck?The government should brace itself because people have learned the lesson that political pressure, including public demonstrations, can and does work. There is growing discontent and growing militancy in addressing a whole raft of areas that come under the direct jurisdiction of the Minister. The cancer services march was but one recent example. In the past month people have also been on the streets demanding justice and equality in the provision of maternity services, and last week, the Mansion House was packed as people protested about the disgraceful cuts in services for people with disabilities in this very special year, the European Year of People with Disabilities. Increasingly, people know their rights, know what the denial of those rights means for them and their families and will not desist in their efforts to have their rights vindicated. People and society have changed and there is no going back.There is apartheid – I heard an earlier speaker refer to the word – in the health services and  that apartheid is very obvious in the area of cancer care. This motion seeks to end that apartheid. It is a most startling statistic that one in four of our population dies of cancer. The five-year report of the National Cancer Registry, published in 2002, contained many other startling facts. Some 50% of patients with lung cancer receive no cancer-specific treatment and 57% of those with leukaemia have not been offered chemotherapy. The incidence of lung cancer among women in this State is 66% above the EU average. The incidence of melanoma among women is up to 53% higher.It is very worrying that while the incidence of lung cancer among men has decreased, which is to be welcomed, among women, and especially young women, it is increasing. That reflects changing patterns of nicotine addiction and poses a major challenge in terms of education and all other aspects of cancer prevention. The tragedy is that so many people with treatable cancers are not being given the treatment that could save their lives. The main reason for this is the gross inequality in the distribution of cancer services in this State. The centralisation of radiotherapy services in Dublin and Cork discriminates against people outside the broad hinterland of those two cities. Across huge swathes of the country, very ill people must travel long distances to receive the treatment they so badly need, the treatment that gives real hope of recovery to them and to their families. As always, it is the elderly, the poor and the vulnerable who suffer most in these circumstances.The motion notes that leaks of the Radiotherapy Service Development Group report have indicated that this centralisation strategy is set to continue and that radiotherapy will only be provided in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The long overdue report should be published without delay so that the uncertainty is ended. If it is the case that the centralisation strategy is to continue then it must be opposed. People in all the regions north of a line from Dublin to Galway are being discriminated against in cancer care, as are those in the south east and the south west. It is a scandal that less than one third of the 12,000 patients who require radiotherapy each year receive it and that public patients face a three-month wait for this vital treatment.The Minister will likely respond that these are very expensive treatments which require a critical mass of patients. We have heard that many times, and representing the constituency and region that I do, I am very familiar with these arguments. Yes, they are expensive treatments and require an increase in the number of health professionals to administer them, but I emphasise my belief that people are willing to pay for better health services through increased taxation if necessary on the basis of a fair and equitable tax system. Health is a priority for everyone.They also want accessible care in their region based on the real conditions in this country and  not on population templates and arbitrary quotas imported from abroad. If the Minister for Health and Children is willing to fight that battle with the Minister for Finance, whom he has accused of not seeing the big picture on health, then he will have the backing of Members on this side of the House and will have the applause of a huge number of people of all opinions.I represent people in one of the regions, the north east, where there is no radiotherapy unit. People in our region must travel to Dublin for radiotherapy. We know the reality of what inequity of services means, and in Monaghan, we are at the receiving end of the dictatorial policy of over-centralisation of services with the downgrading of our hospital.I have already welcomed the promised extension of BreastCheck but we must be assured that the Minister for Finance will provide the necessary funding of €27 million for that extension. For all our sakes, I urge the Minister to heed the people's call for health care justice. The first step he could take is to support this motion, not to seek to amend it but to join all other elected opinion in this House in a united and truly determined statement of intent. Nothing less will meet the people's needs and fears of cancer that has visited a loved one in almost every extended family throughout the land.As a member of a family which has had that tragedy visited upon it, not only in the past but currently, I know I stand with all other elected opinion in appealing to the Minister to put his support behind this motion, as the Government has done with other worthy Private Members' motions presented in the recent past. It is no less a requirement of Government to back this proposal than it was to back another in relation to the needs of people in another land. The people of this land require this Government's support and the collective and united support and effort of all elected opinion. Cancer respects no political differences.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"commends this Government and the previous Government on the implementation of a broadly based cancer care policy which has resulted in an additional cumulative investment of over €400 million in cancer care since 1997, and which has delivered:– extensive development of health promotion policies, particularly in relation to tobacco control;– a substantial increase in medical, nursing and support staff;– an unprecedented increase in investment in oncology drug treatments;– the extension of the national breast screening programme and increased investment in the cervical screening programme;– increased investment in radiotherapy services in Dublin, Cork and Galway;– a significant increase in cancer related activity between 1994 and 2000, including a 58% increase nationally in the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment and a 30% increase nationally in the number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment;– an increase in investment in palliative care;– the development of publicly funded clinical trials infrastructure for the benefit of patients with cancer;and supports the Government in its commitment to further develop cancer care nationally.I am pleased to have the opportunity to describe and put in context the extensive investment and reform programme which the Government has been promoting under the national cancer strategy and particularly since the launch of the health strategy in November 2001, and to set out the current position in relation to cancer services nationally."The Opposition motion fails to appreciate the broad recognition among health service providers of the changes that have taken place in recent years in improving cancer care. Cancer care is too important a service to have it subjected to the "all kinds of everything" motion which the Opposition has put together.In the middle of the 20th century, the chances of surviving cancer were low and showed little improvement from year to year. Over the past few decades, however, there have been some striking changes. In childhood leukaemia, for example, there has been a dramatic improvement in survival. Similar improvements have occurred in Hodgkin's disease, testicular cancer and melanoma. In many other cancers, improvements, although less dramatic, have been taking place. This has greatly changed the experience of cancer.We must, therefore, begin to view cancer not as a death sentence but a condition from which people can expect to survive. Nowadays, there is real hope for patients and families. My focus is to ensure that there is access to services which deliver this experience for each and every person who is diagnosed with cancer. Effectively tackling the problem of cancer means achieving consistently high quality, specialist services for patients, their carers and their families.The Government is committed to the development of co-ordinated and patient-focused cancer treatment. The health strategy provides a highly  ambitious and challenging agenda for the delivery of major improvements in health services throughout the country and signifies the clear and high priority which I attach to cancer and cancer care as part of the overall health system. The first national goal of better health for everyone contains a number of critical objectives in relation to cancer care and I have already made significant progress on many of them.I propose to outline the substantial developments that have taken place in recent years in all the main elements of a comprehensive cancer policy. Health promotion, prevention, primary care and acute and palliative care services have all benefited from investment and improvement.The key goal of the national cancer strategy 1996 was to achieve a 15 % decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten year period from 1994. I am pleased to advise the House that this figure was achieved in 2001, which was three years ahead of target. That is the litmus test in terms of the success or the dividend from the investment we made. We are three years ahead of target in terms of achieving a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer.That said, I agree with Deputies that cancer will continue to be a major challenge to our health services because approximately 21,000 new cases of cancer are recorded annually in this country and one in three of our citizens will develop cancer in the course of their lifetime. Cancer is more common in older people and as the population gets older and as people live longer, we can expect cancer cases to increase accordingly.Our age standardised mortality rates are higher than the EU average and there is scope for improvement to bring our rate in line with other EU countries. The reduction since 1994 in cancer mortality rates is as a result of improved diagnosis, earlier interventions and improved and more widely available cancer treatments. I expect these trends to continue as a result of developments in cancer services and continued improvements in treatments.A particular feature of health policy development over recent years has been the development of highly focused disease specific action programmes. The national cancer strategy is a leading example of this. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, a cumulative figure of €400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in 1996 to implement the national cancer strategy.The national cancer strategy acknowledges that the cause of most cancers is multifactorial but that there is strong evidence – I endorse most of what Deputy Gormley said – that lifestyle factors, in particular smoking, alcohol and diet, play an important role. The promotion of healthy lifestyles is a key element of the work of the Department's health promotion unit and spending by the unit since the launch of the strategy on these topics is in excess of €17 million.Following the signature by the President of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, I established the Office of Tobacco Control on a statutory basis. That office has played a significant role in the fight against tobacco. On 30 January last, I announced my decision to ban smoking in all workplaces from 1 January 2004. I hope I get the support of all Deputies who signed this motion in the implementation of that decision. This ban will include the hospitality industry where many workers are exposed to passive smoking and, as Deputy Gormley said, they have an increased likelihood of suffering from cancer and heart disease as a result.For all health behaviours, there is a shortage of national data representative of the various social subgroups in the Irish population. To combat this, the health promotion unit commissioned the national surveys of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, or the SLÁN survey as it became known, which were carried out by the Centre for Health Promotion Studies, National University of Ireland, Galway. The first SLÁN survey was commissioned in 1998 to provide baseline information on a range of lifestyle related health behaviours in the Irish adult population, with sufficient power to detect differences across age, gender and social strata.In 2002 we re-commissioned the next phase of the SLÁN surveys, with a larger population sample. I am pleased to announce that some positive trends are emerging from this second survey, which I will announce in full tomorrow. The top line indications show that across almost all demographic categories smoking rates have fallen but this trend has been most marked among girls and young women, a key target for our recent anti-smoking initiatives. The overall rate of smoking in school-going children has fallen. While overall exposure to tobacco smoke is down, the rates of exposure at work and in pubs and clubs remain high. Alcohol once again proved to be a problem, despite an increase in the number of school children reporting to never having consumed an alcoholic drink. One of the most positive findings in the survey was the increase in the adherence to the recommended consumption levels of fruit and vegetables in all social groups, particularly men. Again, that is in line with the comments and the constructive contribution Deputy Gormley made to the debate this evening. While these trends in both smoking and diet are positive, a lot more work remains to be done, especially in the area of alcohol consumption, and I will be elaborating more on these issues at the launch of the second SLÁN survey tomorrow.There is increasing recognition internationally of the importance of primary care in the delivery of cancer care. The primary care strategy will provide us with the capacity to ensure that people can experience a well co-ordinated and integrated package of services appropriate to their needs in their communities and their homes. It will broaden the focus of services to include health  promotion, prevention and supportive care for those who have recovered from cancer, are living with cancer or are dying from cancer.Investment to date under the national cancer strategy has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology throughout the country. For example, prior to the national cancer strategy, there was a total of four consultant oncologists in this country. I did not see too many marches about cancer care during those years nor did I see the same degree of agitation and so on. We had only four oncologists in the country. It is easy to attack the Government but we have come a long way from where we were in terms of treating cancer and that should be acknowledged. I would be the first to acknowledge that we have a long way to go but to hear the dismissive comments from some of those opposite in relation to the developments which have taken place in recent years was disingenuous, unfair and not a fair reflection of what has happened.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	447	An additional 12 oncologists have been appointed nationally, including three in the South-Eastern Health Board area alone. Deputy Gormley asked why the bill keeps rising and why we have to invest more. Every time we appoint an oncologist, one can take it for granted that there will be a €2 million to €3 million bill attached in terms of oncology drugs, more activity and greater treatments. That is what is happening, and it is welcome. Other appointments under the national cancer strategy include an additional 21 consultant surgeons with specific expertise in cancer surgery, an additional 13 radiologists and an additional 13 histopathologists.The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients per annum receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. We do not have the figures for 2001 and 2002 but they will show a further increase. This means that an additional 1,407 patients per annum are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients per annum receiving chemotherapy treatment has increased from 2,693 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000, representing an increase of 30 % nationally.Breast cancer is the individual site specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years. Indeed, since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, approval has been granted for an additional 39 consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease across the modalities of surgery, radiology and histopathology. Since 2001, there has been a cumulative investment of €30 million in the development of  symptomatic breast disease services. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred, with in-patient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,336 in 1997 to 1,839 in 2001, an increase of 37%.I announced the national extension of the BreastCheck programme on 27 March last, but certain Deputies should not delude themselves by thinking that the announcement was related to the march they organised and participated in. The Government has said consistently from the start of the programme that phase one would be done first, before phase two, and that there would then be an international evaluation. We have said that we will ensure that the quality is right.

Over 75% of eligible women – a total of 83,000 women – have been called for screening. The programme has been externally reviewed and validated. A team from the European Reference Centre for Quality Assurance visited the programme last year and identified that its key strengths are outstandingly high levels of professional expertise, team working and commitment to the programme, with all disciplines working to an internationally recognised standard. It took two years to set up phase one because it is not just about money, it is about putting in place multi-disciplinary teams. Many of the people we need are not available, unfortunately, which has effects on the numbers we have out there. We had to introduce training programmes quickly to recruit a number of radiographers, for example.The BreastCheck clinical unit in the west will be at University College Hospital, Galway, with two associated mobile units, and will cover counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and north Tipperary. The clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary Victoria Hospital in Cork, with three associated mobile units, and will cover counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and south Tipperary. Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population – those between 50 and 64 years of age – will be eligible for screening. It is expected that the programme will diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population. The expansion of the programme to the west and the south has been costed at €27 million under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, including capital costs of €13 million which will be provided for under the NDP capital provision programme.Discussions are ongoing among officials of my Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies. Meetings took place the week before last in Cork and Galway on the detailed roll-out of the programme. It is intended to prepare an effective and cohesive model which is in the best interests of the women concerned and which builds on the quality standards applied by BreastCheck and develops effective linkages with the symptomatic services. I have had a full meeting with the board of BreastCheck on this key issue, which I identified in responses to parliamentary questions as an issue that the Government wants to resolve before announcing a decision to extend.

There has been a cumu lative investment of €40 million to date in the programme. I have also made available approximately €6 million for the construction of a new state-of-the-art screening unit at St. Vincent's Hospital to replace the current Merrion unit. The Government's commitment to the development of services for women with cancer is further evidenced by the introduction of the Irish cervical screening programme. Cervical screening is a valuable preventative health measure, when delivered. The Government is examining the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme.

Additional resources have been made available in recent years to meet the additional demand for cervical cytology laboratory services and to develop both the laboratory and colposcopy services. An additional €2.5 million was provided in 2002 and a further €1.4 million has been allocated in 2003 for the ongoing development of these services.I accept that we do not have sufficient radiotherapy capacity to meet existing and future demands. The provision of radiotherapy requires significant medical, scientific and support expertise and resources, in addition to extensive capital investment. I established an expert review group on radiotherapy services to ensure that we effectively plan the current and future development of this key element of cancer care. The current debate on radiotherapy services is extremely narrowly based and is confined to geographical location without any real discussion on the principles that should underpin the national provision of services.

Northern Ireland, which has a population of 1.7 million, has decided to centralise its radiotherapy services in Belfast with the construction of a comprehensive radiotherapy facility on the site of a major teaching hospital which will treat all cancer patients in the Six Counties who require radiotherapy. There is considerable optimism in the North about this development as it represents the best and most effective way of organising services in a manner that ensures quality – I stress the word "quality". Some people opposite me would love the political issue to be resolved by putting two machines in many different locations. They want to please everybody politically and to forget about quality, patient survival rates and outcomes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	556	St. Luke's Hospital has seen considerable renovation and upgrading. In excess of €25 million has been invested in St. Luke's Hospital enabling the purchase of significant additional equipment including six new linear accelerators. This investment ensures that St. Luke's continues to meet the demands placed on it as a world class centre for the delivery of radiotherapy.Almost €9 million has been invested in phase 1 of a substantial new building project development at Cork University Hospital for radiation oncology services which was completed in 2002. This involved the commissioning of two new linear accelerators as well as other equipment.A new radiotherapy department is currently under construction at University College Hospital, Galway. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, took the decision to bring Galway on stream ahead of the first cancer strategy recommendations.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	560	We moved quickly to put in place the necessary capital investment for University College Hospital, Galway, to provide a supra-regional centre which will provide services to the western and north-western areas. This development is part of the phase 2 project at University College Hospital, Galway. In excess of €100 million has been allocated to this project which is due for completion in autumn 2003.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	562	The report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care was approved by this Government in the summer of 2001. The report describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its development. This Government has agreed to the implementation of the report's recommendations over a five to seven year period. The implementation of the report will be undertaken as part of the implementation of the national health strategy.Additional revenue funding of €2.5 million was provided in 2003. Since September 2001 almost €11 million has been allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Auth ority to begin implementing the report's recommendations.In February 2003, the first all-Ireland cancer network was launched under the auspices of the Ireland-Northern Ireland National Cancer Institute cancer consortium. The network is being formed by the Irish oncology research group in Dublin, the clinical research support centre in Belfast, nine cancer centres in Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. The new co-operative group will be jointly funded by the Health Research Board in Dublin and the Research and Development Office in Belfast. The group will receive €1 million over the next two years to carry out its work. Its principal role will be to initiate and co-ordinate clinical trials in cancer hospitals in both parts of the island.We have demonstrated our support by investing significant resources in this trilateral programme. Under this scheme, awards to the value of €3.5 million have been made available to allow hospitals to recruit and train staff, improve facilities and take part in world-class clinical trials. This is a first for the country and another example of the significant advances being made in terms of research and the advent of cancer clinical trials to the bedside.

Best results in treatment are achieved where patients are treated by staff working as part of an integrated multidisciplinary specialist team.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	566	This core principle must inform the current organisation of services and how we plan future services across the various modalities of cancer care.I wish to refer to the work of the National Cancer Forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts appointed to advise on cancer services, including hospital services. As part of the development of a new cancer strategy, the forum has examined oncology surgery between 1997 and 2002 in respect of a number of site-specific cancers, including those of lung, breast, pancreas and colon.The forum has concluded that there are too many consultants performing oncology surgery in too many hospitals given the total number of procedures that are performed in our hospitals. We simply do not have the patient caseload to support the current broadly-based organisation of oncology surgical services. The forum has advised me that the current organisation of these services is not in line with international best practice and it will be reflecting further on this issue as it pre pares the next cancer strategy, which I expect to receive later this year.International evidence is that technically challenging surgery, for example, can best be supported if it is concentrated in a relatively small number of centres. This is a message that is evidenced based and needs to be directed at and pursued at a number of levels in our society. At medical level there is a clear responsibility on the profession to respond to this reality in a balanced and adequate manner. As major stakeholders in our health services, I also expect the profession to lead medical and public opinion on this subject and to challenge contrary views. I am convinced that the medical profession on a more organised basis also needs to articulate to politicians on matters of this importance. Too often, it is left to politicians to respond to pressure to pursue the organisation of services that is based on sectional interests and not on best practice. It must be understood that having a service is no longer sufficient; it must be a service that is organised in such a way that it is capable of delivering quality in line with international standards and practice. We must face the reality that we cannot continue to expect that we can deliver the highest quality of cancer services across over 30 acute hospitals. I am not prepared to stand over a service—

To do so would be to create an apartheid system that is simply not acceptable. That is the real apartheid that would be achieved if Deputy Cowley's views and proposals held sway, in my opinion. A new apartheid would be created, one of quality versus lack of quality.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	570	These are major challenges for politicians, the medical profession and society generally. While we must continue to invest in quality, we must also organise for quality. Best cancer care must be benchmarked against quality indicators and not indicators based on geography. In terms of our achievements in improving cancer care, I have presented information to the House today regarding increased manpower and increased activity. These are an important measure of improvements in cancer care. However, we also need to develop further our understanding of the process of care.The ultimate objective in terms of the delivery of cancer care is that those in receipt of services experience outcomes on a par with best international standards.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	572	Health information is fundamental to assessing and implementing quality programmes. The national health strategy provides  for the establishment of an independent health information and equality authority to lead the development of health information to support these requirements. That authority will exercise a pivotal role regarding a number of key information functions. It is only through focusing on specific information developments such as this, to build on the excellent work of the national cancer registry, that we will be able to continuously demonstrate the positive impact that cancer services are having and also to identify the areas which may need to be addressed to further strengthen our cancer care system.Last month, the Irish Society for Quality and Safety in Healthcare launched the results of the latest survey undertaken on its behalf into patient perception of the quality of health care. The health strategy contains many commitments associated with both people centredness and quality issues. It clearly identifies the need for health care providers to put the patient at the centre in the delivery of care and to take into account the views of patients regarding the care they receive.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The results of the 2002 survey are positive in many respects. Patients perceive the quality of the care and service they received to be very high. Some of the findings mentioned in the survey include: 92% of patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of care they received during their stay in hospital; 85% of patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the standard of service they received in the accident and emergency department; 90% of patients who underwent a procedure reported having it adequately explained to them; and 92% of patients expressed a high level of overall satisfaction with the hotel aspects of hospital service.We are fortunate in this country that those involved in cancer care provide a professional and high standard of care that is broadly appreciated by those with cancer and their families. I wish to recognise this dedication and commitment. My objective as Minister for Health and Children is to ensure that the substantial investment is reflected in improvement in health outcomes for cancer patients.The developments which I have outlined describe an overall framework through which cancer services can be developed and provided in the most co-ordinated and effective manner. I am glad of the opportunity to place on the record of the House the substantial developments that have taken place in cancer services. It is appropriate that this House should commend the Government for its positive and demonstrable commitment to cancer services. I consider that while  we have achieved a lot, a lot more needs to be done.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I am being assertive.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	578	This is a serious issue. It is not often we discuss such a life and death matter in this House and an issue in which we all share the common objective of the desirability of a world-class service. We all share the best possible motives in dealing with this issue. We all want to achieve the best quality service for all. For these reasons, it is too important an issue with which to play politics and it is too complex to be decided merely by reference to party political considerations, electoral advantage or geographical considerations.As Opposition spokesperson, it is legitimate for me and my colleagues to bring home to the Government in the strongest possible terms the need to reappraise its approach to cancer care, prioritise investment in quality treatment, invest in preventative programmes and, most importantly, bring a sense of urgency to dealing with the extent of the problem which faces us. I accept there are few votes in preventative medicine. No thanks ever accrued for saving people from diseases they might have developed, but never actually developed. The Minister would have the support of all sides of the House for screening programmes for early detection and treatment, which would not just improve outcomes but would immeasurably improve the quality of life for patients. If it is to survive, the whole focus of the health service must be towards keeping people healthy and early treatment, rather than waiting for the crisis to emerge, involving admission to costly acute hospital beds.The Minister recently announced the extension of BreastCheck, albeit under strong pressure, which is widely welcomed. However, he did a disservice to the House and the public when he refused to identify what budget will pay for the service. He implied in reply to a question I put to him that it would come out of this year's cancer budget. Given that it was not originally provided for as part of the budget, it begs the question as to what part of the cancer service will now be postponed or delayed. I am assuming nothing will be cancelled but something must be postponed and delayed if money is going to a new service announced in recent weeks. Will the previously announced BreastCheck service for the south-east or the radiotherapy services planned for Galway be postponed or delayed? This should not be a matter of political spin or obfuscation.The issue must be clarified, as must the thinking behind the inexplicable decision to delay the commissioning of equipment for the radiotherapy services in Galway and the further delay in the process of recruitment until the equipment is installed. To those of us who are not privy to the rationale behind this thinking, it sounds like a wanton waste of time and money, particularly as the Minister knows that even when the service is up and running in 2006 at the earliest, it will be five or even ten years before the kind of expertise patients deserve has been gained by staff, however well meaning and qualified. For many years, people will have to travel to Dublin for complex treatment.Given the long lead-in time for radiotherapy services, it is unsatisfactory that the expert group report has not yet been published. It has been quoted from by the Minister, widely leaked and commented on in the newspapers. I have read press statements of people responding to it but it still has not been published. It is equally unsatisfactory that it appears not to make recommendations about services outside the three national centres identified. It is incomprehensible, if true, that it recommends a further report. This is just not acceptable as we have been waiting for years. Where the services will be ultimately located is a political decision. It is a costly and complex service with a long lead-in time.Expert advice, rightly sought by the Minister, is essential. I do not understand why an expert group would seek to pass the buck or why it would postpone matters. It is another excuse to defer decisions that are crucial. It is an excuse for postponing investment decisions in a service which has a lead-in time of ten years. The vacuum is filled by demands from all over the country, including hospitals engaging in turf wars about where the services will be located. This is not how these decisions should be made.I ask the Minister to seriously consider the demands of this motion and what is being said by people throughout the country. He should consider in an open and flexible way how services should be delivered to ensure everyone has access to a quality service. He should take into account the fact that it is unacceptable that people should have to travel long distances. Radiotherapy services, in particular, are not just a treatment service, they are a pain-relieving service. People who cannot be transported should be able to avail of these services, therefore, we must be far more flexible in this regard than in the past. Perhaps he should look at moving multidisciplinary teams to other locations rather than moving patients. That may mean an investment in equipment in many other locations. However, equipment gives a good return over many years. I accept it would be more difficult to put together multidisciplinary teams. I ask the Minister to listen to the sense of the motion which requests a comprehensive service of the highest quality for everyone in the country.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and congratulate the Technical Group on tabling it.It is now clear that the Minister has abandoned the national cancer strategy. Some 29,812 people died in Ireland in 2001, 7,577, or one in four, of whom died from cancer. We have the third highest cancer rate in Europe and many of those who die are on so-called waiting lists. It is difficult to tell someone who is on a waiting list for cancer treatment that one will make representations on his or her behalf and try to assist. One must tell them they will be called off the list because they cannot get preference to people who are placed before them, and people die in these circumstances.Screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer, which has great potential to reduce the incidence of cancer, is practically non-existent. The Minister has not yet indicated where the money will come from for the extension of the BreastCheck service. The Minister for Finance said today there is no money available to end the current strike action by public health doctors. While we welcome the announcement to extend the BreastCheck service, from where will the money for the service come? How can the Minister doubt our scepticism when he has a Minister at his back saying there is not a single shilling for anything else?Some 16% of cancer patients in Ireland receive radiotherapy, while the EU average is 66%. The highest figure in Europe receiving radiotherapy treatment is more than 80%. These statistics prove that the Government has abandoned the 1996 national cancer strategy.Under the Minster's stewardship, patients with cancer have had to resort to court action to vindicate their rights to lifesaving hospital treatment and care. That is surely an indication of how the national cancer strategy has been abandoned. The Minister has described this as unacceptable as if he was a disinterested observer rather than a member of the Government charged with responsibility for the provision of timely and appropriate care.For a person with cancer, stress and the physical and psychological difficulties experienced can create tensions and such a person is anxious to get timely and appropriate care. We know that cancer can develop rapidly in some people. People need immediate care – waiting lists are inappropriate for cancer sufferers as they know their life is increasingly threatened as time passes. The record of the Government in this area is abysmal. No attempt has been made in the past five years to change the way our health service operates to deliver more cohesive and accessible patient care.The current Government and the previous one has had more money available than any previous Administration, yet cancer services have not been taken care of. It is indefensible that patients suffering from cancer in 21st century Ireland have to wait for essential treatment because of the lack  of hospital beds. It is disgraceful that eight years after its launch, the national cancer strategy is not further advanced. It is offensive for the Minister to blame hard-pressed hospitals for delays in the delivery of services rather than his own inaction.The Government has failed to give priority to cancer services that would see more people survive cancer, have an enhanced quality of life and enjoy more years with their families and loved ones. Life is precious. Everybody wants to extend their life and someone diagnosed with cancer wants immediate treatment so that they might have the opportunity to share a longer life with their loved ones. We all know of people who lived for 15 or 20 years having received good and immediate care. The longer one waits for essential treatment, the less time one is likely to have to spend with loved ones.I welcome the BreastCheck programme. While the Bill establishing the children's ombudsman may be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I note that this position will not be filled for at least another 12 months. We hope that BreastCheck is not put on a similarly long finger.In the provision of cancer services in this country there is paralysis of analysis. We are still waiting for the report of the expert group on radiotherapy. It was promised in both February 2001 and February 2002. Meanwhile, University College Hospital Galway continues to be the world's only designated comprehensive cancer centre that can offer any type of radiotherapy. We have the potential to provide world-class cancer services in this country. We have highly skilled, highly motivated, compassionate and dedicated health professionals. We have wonderful palliative care facilities and incredible patient support services. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will agree that we have as excellent a palliative service in the Milford Hospice Care Centre as there is in any area of the country. I pay special tribute to the work that is being carried out there. We all know family members and friends that have experienced that palliative care. While there is immense goodwill and generosity from the public, we lack the political will, action and leadership to deal with the situation.The Government has paid lip service to the cancer strategy. The sad fact is that the Minister's inaction is costing lives. Set against a backdrop of the list of achievements, such as that offered tonight, the Government's failure to implement the vital strategy is a shameful breach of faith to cancer patients, their families and those who care for them.I will now focus on the provision of radiotherapy service in the mid-western area. I am sure I will have the support of the Minister of State, with whom I spent seven years on the Mid-Western Health Board. He was a most positive figure and one of the best members of the board during my time on it. I had the honour on several  occasions of seconding his candidature for the chairmanship of the board.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	582	As the Minister knows, the mid-west region has sought radiotherapy services for a long time. The Minister of State will be able to confirm that this came to light during the last election campaign. While it would be easy to say the issue was raised at every second door, I am not exaggerating when I say that the absence of radiotherapy services in the mid-west was raised at at least one door in ten when I was canvassing.People in Dublin do not understand how difficult and traumatic it is for people living in the mid-west to access services in Dublin or Cork. There had been a proposal to establish a radiotherapy service in the mid-west for the benefit of cancer patients in the area. It was a unique proposal and was adopted by the health board at its meeting on 17 January. The proposal is that a public private partnership between the Mid-Western Health Board, the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust and the Mater Private Hospital, Dublin, should be established in the region. This is an example of the mid-west making a proposal on how to provide the services there. It is asking for the Minister's support rather than coming to him with a begging bowl and asking him to provide the service.The Mid-Western Health Board proposes to provide a site adjacent to the existing cancer centre at the Mid-West Regional Hospital. Planning permission exists for a radiotherapy unit in the hospital. The development trust will provide approximately €6 million for the building and equipment and the State would not have to provide any money for construction of the building. The Mater Hospital will be responsible for the operating costs of the service.There are currently four centres, with two private facilities providing radiotherapy. Three of the centres are in Dublin and Cork and this does not meet the demand that exists. The result is long waiting lists for people in the mid-west region in particular. They have difficulty in obtaining treatment due to the distances involved and often have to spend six weeks away from home while availing of cancer treatment in Dublin or Cork. The Minister will appreciate that this is extremely stressful for cancer patients and their families. We are proposing the establishment of a local unit that will transform the lives of those patients and their families.The Minister will be aware that three years ago he appointed an expert group to examine the need for radiotherapy services. Perhaps he will tell me at a later stage what is happening in that area.

In page 3, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:1.–The Minister shall keep the list of designated events under section 3 of the Principal Act under review from time to time and at least every 2 years.On Committee Stage the Minister gave an indication that he might look favourably on the prescription that "the list of designated events under section 3 of the Principal Act under review from time to time and at least every 2 years."  Many Deputies contributed to the debate on Second Stage when the list of events designated was discussed at length and said the bulk of them relates to association football and that only the All-Ireland hurling and football finals, our native games, were included. Despite the developments in the draws for both the football and hurling championships in recent years, frequently there are exciting games which affect teams from different parts of the island and which, conceivably, could be regarded in the future as events of national importance. At the same time the Six Nations Championship was not included in the designations because of the pool system, as the Minister explained. Looking at the situation last Sunday week when Ireland was one match away from an amazing championship win, a Grand Slam title, we could see clearly that this was also a national occasion.The Minister carried out lengthy consultations for which I commended him on Second Stage. It was a very interesting document which informed our speeches on this side of the House in regard to all the sports and how the decisions were made. We know how decisions were reached on this occasion. Given the general development of sport and culture – culture was hardly referred to in relation to this process – the designation should be kept under continuous review. The Labour Party considers that to place it in the Long Title of the Bill would be the right way forward. The Minister said he might consider including this amendment – he was generous in respect of another amendment from Fine Gael in the name of Deputy Coveney.

The only thing I am annoyed about is that I did not put the proposal forward. The amendment makes sense. I note the Minister is speaking in terms of reviews every three years. He is taking on board the principle that it is proper to review this matter every so often. Perhaps  the Minister will indicate the reason he is opting for three years rather than two.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The Minister's amendment is welcome and has been stimulated, perhaps, by Deputy Broughan's request for a review procedure to be put in place. We need to look at golf and key events, such as the Irish Open, as a possible event of national interest, at some stage in the future. Clearly there is a need for a review process every two or three years. It does not make a huge difference whether it is every two or three years. My only concern is that if a sporting body or an event organiser enters into a six-year contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster and in two or three years' time we decide to designate that event, is it the case that contract becomes null and void? There is a concern among some sporting bodies that there will be a lack of confidence among non-qualifying broadcasters to offer substantial sums of money for contracts over a long period when they know there is a danger their event could be designated. This is a genuine concern and I am not trying to be difficult. If the Minister deals with it, that will address some of my concerns.

I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment although we are not far apart on it. The proposal in my amendment No. 15 will cover the situation. To reply to Deputy Coveney, all the broadcasters and event organisers will have some certainty now because I have already indicated I would embark on a review in two years' time so that the list will be in existence for another two years. At that stage there may be a review. It is possible that other events that are not envisaged may well be designated in the future. I cannot second-guess what would be the policy of a future Government on these issues. Under the directive, which is the basis for this legislation, we are allowed designate. The representations made by sporting organisations would be taken into account in any future designation because there must be a process of consultation and review and, obviously, the matter must come before the House.There is a long road ahead for future events that may or may not be designated. It is the case -all sides must be aware of this, as were some of the protagonists in this instance – that the 1999 television without frontiers directive allowed nation states to cordon off certain events of historical and cultural importance. In the designation process we looked at the possibility of designating one or two cultural events as well as sporting events. At the end of the day we decided to adopt the approach we did purely in relation to sporting events.

In page 5, line 15, after "rights" to insert "and the Court may if necessary set aside any contract which in the opinion of the Court impedes the exercise of rights under the Principal Act".I tabled the amendment because of the powers the High Court was being given in relation to existing contracts between the event organiser and another broadcaster who was not a qualifying broadcaster, where an event or part of it was proceeding.It seemed at that stage that we needed to spell out clearly that Part 3 of the directive, the key element on which the 1999 Act was based and on which this amendment Bill is now based, and that it should be completely implemented in spirit as well as in fact. We had a discussion earlier regarding BSkyB in the future and the kind of global network this massive cross-media company has established in broadcasting and all kinds of other media, particularly print media, and how such an organisation can determine the rates to be set for important public events. I agreed with Deputy Ryan the last time this was discussed that the fundamental point in this Bill, which is mentioned again in the Minister's amended section, is the fixing of reasonable market rates.This Minister faced a fait accompli when he took over the Department and found effectively that the 1999 Act had been left in abeyance for two and a half to three years and had not been implemented for whatever reason. We in the Labour Party and on this side of the House are suspicious about the Minister's real reasons for not implementing it and suddenly beginning again the whole process of consulting sports bodies to try to discover what would be a proportionate response in order to protect not just the rights of sporting bodies and event organisers but also those of broadcasters. I am not sure that he succeeded in doing this and that this is why he wanted to give this a further cutting edge. There is provision for varying a contract, which allows for a contract to be set aside if it was in the interests of the cultural and sporting life of the country.It seems that the last number of games, even of our association football teams, have not been available to every household, which is deplorable. The Government got us into that boat. The Minister's predecessor, my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, had set in train a development which would have prevented such an event. However, now people are talking about ballpark figures of €8 million in respect of the European Championship games in soccer. I ask the Minister to per haps give the ultimate power to the High Court in regard to such agreements.

I do not know how long he was in the office – maybe three years.I cannot agree to the Deputy's amendment. Section 4(10) gives the High Court enough power in regard to existing contracts. I do not want to be over-prescriptive. I wish to be proportionate. All we are dealing with is the entitlement of the Irish people to have on free-to-air television certain games of major sporting importance to society. From that point of view it would only mean varying a contract or adjusting the contract regarding either exclusive or non-exclusive rights vis-à-vis a non-qualifying broadcaster with an event organiser. That it is more than adequately taken care of.

In page 5, to delete lines 20 to 29.The effect of this amendment is to delete from the legislation the provision allowing a court to grant to a qualifying broadcaster access to an event without first deciding on the conditions of access and price that will have to be paid. It is farcical that a broadcaster could be allowed access to an event without knowing how much it will cost to cover it and without the event organiser or the sporting body knowing how much they will be paid for it. This level of uncertainty may lead to problems. For example, if RTE goes to the High Court to get access to a match, and the court proceedings go on for some time and a decision cannot be obtained through the arbitration process on the rate that will be applied for the event, would it be sensible for RTE to go ahead and cover it, not knowing how much it was going to cost? It will not have budgeted for it. The whole point of this legislation is that the coverage should be both affordable for qualifying  broadcasters and treat event organisers and sporting bodies fairly. Both parties involved, whether they be a qualifying broadcaster or an event organiser, are being treated unfairly by this section of the Bill.Sections 4 and 5 attempt to do the same and put in place a text that will require the court to decide both on conditions and rates for access up to three weeks before the event. If RTE believes the rate is too high and decides not to cover the event, at least there will be a period of time for the sporting body or the event organiser to get somebody else, probably a non-qualifying broadcaster, to cover it, which is better than having no coverage. On the other hand, the sporting bodies will know three weeks before an event how much they are going to be paid for it.The Minister was concerned about the possibility of a crisis as a result of running out of time and an event needing to be covered. However, we should not dictate to the court a timetable that cannot be realised.I have made provision for a lesser period which the Minister directs. If there are exceptional circumstances and a decision needs to be made two days before access to the event, then the Minister can facilitate that if necessary.We need to have text in the legislation which encourages and, potentially, requires the court to do its business up to three weeks before the event takes place, for all the reasons I have outlined. The Minister, sensibly and I thank him for it, increased the length of time during which people can go to court to get access before the event from 28 days to 56 days. If the process needs to go to the High Court, which it will not have to do in most cases, it will be dealt with between 56 days and 21 days prior to the event. That is a reasonable timescale which treats both the sporting body and the qualifying broadcaster in a fair manner.

The direction he is proposing is wrong. It shifts the ground away from the public interest towards the sporting bodies. We have already seen one sports body putting the fans and the public interest second and its own bottom line first, by selling broadcasting rights to Sky. I was under the impression that this legislation was geared to protecting and safeguarding the rights of the public more than the rights of sports bodies, which is the direction in which Deputy Coveney is moving.Flexibility is required where a short period is available to the court for seeing though the arbitration process and the broadcaster needs to plan and make preparations for covering the events. The legislation before us is an admirable, if late, attempt by the Government to put public interest before the vested interests of sporting bodies. On that basis, I will be opposing the amendment.

I have made it quite clear on every Stage that the primary purpose of the Bill, which we support, is to ensure that the public comes first. However, there is no reason we cannot also ensure that the sporting bodies and qualifying broadcasters are treated in a fair and sensible manner. That is the balance we are attempting to achieve with these amendments. Of course the public is the priority in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The amendments proposed by Deputy Coveney are designed to require the High Court to fix terms in sufficient time to allow the event organiser to make other arrangements in the event that a qualifying broadcaster has decided to withdraw its application under section 4(1). We are all anxious to ensure that if the matter goes before a court it will be brought to an early conclusion. That is why the amendment I brought forward and amended to include the 56 days, as was proposed by Deputy Coveney on Committee Stage, is sufficient to catch what we are all trying to do.I disagree with Deputy Coveney's approach for a number of reasons. Deputy Coveney's amendments propose that the High Court would be bound to make a decision on reasonable market rates at least 21 days before the date of the event. This would have the impact of removing, as an option for the court, the possibility of fixing the rate after the event had taken place. It is not unusual for a court to make a decision regarding terms and conditions after an event. It is to be expected that the court would endeavour to reach a speedy decision but I am strongly of the view that the hands of the court should not be tied. I discussed this with officials of my own Department and from the Attorney General's office. It should be left to the High Court to decide when it is ready to make a decision on reasonable market rates.Amendment No. 4 provides that the High Court should fix reasonable market rates less than 21 days before an event takes place, provided the court has the permission of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I am of the view that this would be a gross intrusion in the independence of the court. Once the matter is before the court I do not see a role for the Executive or for ministerial involvement. Full discretion should be left to the courts. The Bill, as drafted, provides that the High Court could fix reasonable market rates after the event has taken place. The effect of amendments Nos. 3 and 6 would be to remove this option and I disagree with the objective of those amendments.The first thing to get clear is that allowing  the High Court to fix the rate after the event has taken place is not bad for the event organisers. Where the High Court route is used to agree terms the event organiser will be paid a reasonable market rate. The event organiser has no choice but to accept the court's findings. Accordingly, the event organiser will get the same cheque, whether the court fixes the rate ten days before the event or ten days after.There would, of course, be a risk for the qualifying broadcaster. So, if the qualifying broadcaster accepted rights on the basis that the rate would be fixed after the event there would be a risk for the broadcaster that it would end up paying a price to which it would not have agreed had the rate been fixed before the event. The real issue, however, is that it is for the court alone to decide when it is ready to make the decision as to what constitutes reasonable market rates. One of the options open to the court must be to make an order granting a qualifying broadcaster access to the event while, at the same time, deferring, if necessary, a decision on the price until such time as the event had taken place. If the court does not have this option it would be faced with taking a decision on reasonable market rates before it is ready to do so, which I do not think anyone here would want, or not granting access to the event to a qualifying broadcaster on the grounds that the court had insufficient time to reach a fair decision on a reasonable market rate, which it would be obliged to do if it could not come to a decision regarding reasonable market rates.While agreeing with the principle that an early decision would be best, I think the court must have flexibility in dealing with any application under section 4(1). The amendments proposed by Deputy Coveney may, by removing the flexibility allowed to the court, prevent the court, in certain circumstances, from facilitating the broadcasting of designated events on free-to-air television. For those reasons I oppose amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6.

There is a difference in the market between selling an event to all broadcasters, qualifying and non-qualifying, and to two potential buyers, TV3 and RTE, the only qualifying broadcasters in Ireland. I am not referring solely to the FAI deal with Sky, I want the general principle to exist in the Bill. This is not an effort to get compensation for Sky or the FAI, it is merely an example of what can happen. If a sporting body or broadcaster suffers significant financial losses where an event is designated, the High Court should have the power to award compensation to the body if it is appropriate.

There is a case that designation could impact on the ability of an event organiser to maximise resources from the sale of television rights and could also impact on broadcasters. By accepting the amendment, however, a non-qualifying broadcaster who has entered into a contract prior to this legislation could be compensated for a situation where it was clear that there was a move towards designation and it entered into the contract in full knowledge of that.The television without frontiers directive allowed intervention to protect these events. Because of the scenario we faced, we included sections 4, 9 and 10 in the Bill. Section 10 relates to the adjusting of an existing contract and there  is no need to put in a reference to compensation for the event organiser or the non-qualifying broadcaster because in the scenario we are dealing will that has caused the difficulty. We would be awarding compensation to a satellite operator who would not get exclusive rights under this designation, something it wanted at the very start.

In page 6, to delete lines 50 and 51.Amendment No. 8 is a technical drafting amendment that does not change the effect of section 5. I am advised by the parliamentary counsel that subsection (3) is not required as the matter is already dealt with in section 48 of the Arbitration Act 1954. On amendment No. 9, section 5 of the Bill deals with the concerns expressed by event organisers that qualifying broadcasters would use event designation to drive down the price for access to such events in the future. The arbitration mechanism was called for during the consultation process and it was warmly welcomed by the sporting organisations.The Bill provides for a situation where there is an agreement to have an event broadcast by a qualifying broadcaster but not on what constitutes a fair price. The amendment would mean that the arbitration finding would not be binding on either the event organiser or the broadcaster so it would not be helpful to the event organiser. The Bill, as drafted, provides that the finding of an arbitrator is binding on the event organiser if the qualifying broadcaster accepts the finding within 21 days. A qualifying broadcaster is therefore required to make a definite decision after an arbitrator has issued its findings to pay the price or withdraw.Without this mechanism negotiations could go on and on, frustrating the situation. This would not be in the interests of the event organiser who would still not know if the qualifying broadcaster is prepared to pay reasonable market rates for acquiring rights to televise the event. The arbitration mechanism will not only determine reasonable market rate but will help to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. A completely non-binding arbitration mechanism, as proposed by Deputy Coveney, would not be of assistance in bring negotiations to a conclusion and would probably only lead to the case ultimately arriving in the High Court. The High Court could then ask why the matter is before it when it has already been decided res judicata. It would say the fee has already been set by another body.This legislation is geared to ensure that events are broadcast on free to air television and any  movement in this section would weaken the effort we are making to protect the public interest.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I welcome the fact that, following consultation, the Minister included an arbitration process because it was not originally in the Bill. If we are putting an arbitration process in place, however, the whole point is to treat both sides fairly and come up with a compromise. That is what arbitration means. The current wording means that all the cards in negotiations are held by the broadcaster. If the event organiser and the broadcaster cannot agree a price and they go to the arbitrator, once the arbitrator makes a ruling, if the broadcaster does not like the price he can say it is too expensive and go to court. If the sporting body does not like it, that is tough and it must accept it. That is not arbitration.The purpose of this Bill is to get a fair price to ensure the event is covered and the public has the opportunity to see it. I support that principle, but if there is an arbitration process it must be binding on both parties and that is not practical here because the broadcaster cannot be forced to pay the money. The alternative is to have an arbitration process like the Labour Court where neither party is obliged to accept the ruling. In this instance the sporting body is obliged to accept the price decided by the arbitrator and the broadcaster is not.If the broadcaster turns down the arbitration rate and the dispute goes to court, I accept the need at that stage for the broadcaster to make a decision on accepting or not the court decision and to decide whether to cover the event.Where an arbitration process can include court proceedings, the event organiser must accept the ruling of the court because of the need to guarantee that the event is covered. However, at the earlier stage, when both sides volunteer to go to an arbitrator, the legislation would be more balanced if the arbitration process was binding on only one party. The sporting bodies are being treated poorly in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I return to the premise on which this legislation was introduced, namely, to protect for the public interest a limited and specific number of events. If an unbinding arbitration process was to be imposed on both parties, they would effectively use it. I hazard a guess that event organisers in particular would use it to bring to the wire, or frustrate, the televising of the event. I do not mean that to be disrespectful to the event organisers, but they would try to prolong the process for as long as possible with the result that the qualifying broadcaster could well have to go to court. That is not what we wish to achieve.The arbitration provision was originally based on the premise of an agreement to broadcast, but if the amendment is accepted it could happen that the event broadcaster could decline to cover the event. The provision allowing the qualifying broadcaster the option to decline an award was inserted for good policy reasons as without it, a  large onus may be placed on either of the country's two broadcasters to accept a figure they could not afford. They may wish to have the option to decline, in which case the event organiser could reach an agreement elsewhere. The event organiser will know within 21 days if there is a deal, which is the way it should be.

In page 7, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:"(a) the needs of free to air broadcasters,”.Most of those who spoke on Committee Stage considered that the criteria laid out in section 6 were perhaps among the most important aspects of the Bill. The 1999 Act refers to a fair market rate and reference has been made to reasonable market rates. The word "reasonable" has legal connotations in the history of jurisprudence.The Labour Party considers that the fundamental needs of broadcasters should also be included in these criteria. Section 6, paragraph (f), refers to, “such other matters as may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates.”  Deputy Coveney has referred to the fears and concerns of the sporting bodies, but the other side to the equation must also be considered.I am pleased that my distinguished colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is beside me in this debate because he played a heroic and fundamental role in having this legislation introduced. The European Union directive, Télévision Sans Frontières, also seeks to ensure that European Union member state citizens will be able to view great sporting and cultural events as a fundamental right and to resist the attempts of organisations such as the Murdoch and Kirch media conglomerates to turn these events into commodities.A number of months ago, RTE unions and management appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and a delegation from TV3 appeared before it recently. Some people considered that I was somewhat harsh on the TV3 delegation, but my purpose was to get TV3 to compete strongly and begin to provide good programming across the schedule, something it is not doing at present.The committee engaged in lengthy debate on the different financial needs of both broadcasters. As the national broadcaster, RTE has a great national task in transmitting the core values of the nation in areas such as music, language and the other high national tasks accorded to one of the country's oldest semi-State bodies. The Minister addressed some of the issues raised, especially with regard to an increase in the television licence fee. The committee also considered the concerns of TV3.The purpose of the amendment is to secure a level playing pitch for both sides in this area and to ensure that the spirit of what my colleague intended is met. This will mean ensuring that in the process provided for in the legislation, the needs of free-to-air broadcasters will be considered. There may be additional such broadcasters in the future.The key aim is to ensure that the public will not be prevented from viewing an event because of the kind of market that appears to have been created by the deal reached between the FAI and BSkyB. A price of approximately €8 million appears to have been agreed between the FAI and BSkyB for the latter's right to the exclusive broadcasting of the FAI team's qualifying games in the European Championships. The concern that this may be used as a benchmark for future transactions must be addressed and I propose this be done by way of this amendment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	614	Deputy Broughan is correct to identify this section as the crux of the Bill, certainly from the perspective of the Opposition. We are concerned that in not amending the Bill in some way, as proposed by these amendments, the Minister will ensure that the legislation will produce an effect that is counter to the stated intention. The key issue centres on the definition of the term "market rates". The Minister maintains that section 6, paragraph (f) will be sufficient to ensure that in the case of dispute, the High Court must take, “such other matters as may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates”, and that this will be sufficient to ensure that it takes account of the concerns raised by Opposition spokespersons. The Minister said he would be willing to accept amendments which were supported by genuine arguments. In view of this it will be disappointing if he does not accept one of these amendments in an attempt to ensure that the legislation does not produce the opposite effect of what he intends, and which we fully support.Following Committee Stage, I redrafted amendment No. 11 in my name to try and take into account comments made by the Minister. I took him at his word when he indicated that he might consider an amendment that will deal with non-exclusive or free to air coverage rights for particular events.If "non-exclusive live coverage" is the wrong phrase and the Minister prefers the term "free to air", I am happy to accept it. However, it is important to indicate to the High Court what we are looking for. When we refer to market rates, we should point out that we mean the market rates for free to air programming rather than market rates as set by exclusive broadcasters.To reiterate one of the main points I made on Committee Stage, if market rates are not set on that sort of limited basis, the High Court will have to take into account the market rates that apply to broadcasters like Sky. In that regard, we are not talking about a fair and free market because, under present arrangements, Sky is able to insert into programmes advertising which is directly targeted at the Irish market. It gets significant revenues from this advertising without being subject to the requirements imposed on free to air broadcasters here and without any regulation and control from the Minister, nor does it have increased incremental costs.We have one broadcaster which is able to draw significant revenues from the State, but is under none of the restrictions other free to air broadcasters must observe. Sky has a well known, worldwide strategy whereby it purchases sports rights as an introductory tool to access a market and builds up a customer base. It is willing to set far higher rates than can be afforded by any terrestrial broadcaster for high profile national sporting events.If the Minister does not accept the point and is happy to allow the High Court to set the market rates, I cannot see how the court will do other than interpret the Bill as obliging it to take into account what satellite broadcasters are willing to pay. In such circumstances, the arbitrator will set a rate which the terrestrial broadcasters may have to refuse to pay unless the Minister is willing to allow a further increase in the licence fee to enable them to budget for such prices. The Bill provides, rightly, that the satellite broadcaster can mop up in regard to events where the market rate is set higher than the terrestrial broadcaster can afford, because Sky has done these deals already. Unless the Minister is willing to accept or formulate an amendment to provide the High Court with a clear indication that the market rate is not simply what any other broadcaster can pay, the Bill will be fatally flawed. On Committee Stage, the Minister came close to accepting such an amendment when he said he might consider a wording which takes into account free to air or non-exclusive live coverage. For that reason, I amended amendment No. 11 to incorporate the wording the Minister used on Committee Stage and I hope he will accept it.Amendment No. 13 addresses a key issue. It is perfectly legitimate for legislators, who are responsible for broadcasting policy in the State, to make a condition or provide a reminder for the High Court which informs it that we want year-round sports coverage to bring us the everyday drama and excitement of Irish sporting life. We do not want to see cherry-picking of major sporting events with a large commercial revenue potential. To their credit, TV3 and RTE cover, week in and week out, the Eircom soccer league which we know from Committee Stage is of great interest to the Minister. Does he wish to promote coverage of that sort or is he happy to sit back and fail to use his legislative role to provide for it? If he wishes to promote sport by legislating for the everyday rather than just the major events, it would be valid to accept this amendment. I have tried to move towards the Minister's position by including the wording of paragraph (f) rather than provide for a separate clause as I did originally.My last amendment is not as important, but it is valid. If the Minister is willing to steer the High Court in the direction of considering the time of day the event occurs, the period for which rights are offered and the revenue potential, it is valid to ask the court to consider how much coverage will be given to the sport and what the production costs will be. As I said on Committee Stage, such a clause might benefit sporting organisations which cover some of the broadcaster's costs by providing facilities for it.To address the concerns of sporting organisations which feel they may be losing out, we still have a competitive process in free to air and terrestrial broadcasting. The two primary channels, RTE and TV3, would provide a competitive bidding system as they are not great friends and I cannot see them working in a duopoly. If they talked to each other, it would be a major achievement. As anyone who has been to a house auction knows, all you need are two bidders to hike up a price. If sporting bodies are concerned, they should note that there will be a genuine market in terms of the very limited number of events under discussion. The broadcasters in place and possible broadcasters to come would provide sufficient competition to establish an appropriate market rate. If we leave the Bill as it is and the Minister does not provide some wording to steer the High Court, the court can only understand market rates as those which have been set by satellite broadcasters. The Minister will have failed to achieve his stated goal of protecting the right of Irish people to see on free to air certain key sporting and cultural events. I hope the Minister will see his way to making some changes.

I am of the opinion that the Minister agrees with us with regard to the essence of the issue. There  is a difference between the two market places, one of which is for the two qualifying broadcasters – TV3 and RTE – and one of which is an open market where non-qualifying broadcasters will compete. The High Court will be obliged to look at the guidelines we provide and the very first one it sees will require consideration of previous fees, if any, for the event or similar events. In the case of the FAI, the High Court will have to consider previous fees of €12 million for an event. Was that the figure?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Let us say it was €7.5 million, although my understanding was the same as Deputy Eamon Ryan's – I am using the example only to make a point. Deputy Broughan has said that I have been representing the interests of the sporting bodies, which I have, unashamedly, but in this instance I am concerned that qualifying broadcasters will not be able to afford the rates set by the court if the primary focus is previous fees, if any, paid for the event or similar events. My wording seeks to recognise that we should only consider previous fees paid in the market place of free to air television. If amended, the Bill's provisions would refer to previous fees, if any, designated previously for free television broadcasting or similar designated events for free television services.We are asking the court to consider previous fees within the market place of free to air television as opposed to considering the other market place which grossly distorts the price. My main concern is that if the court decides on too high a rate, the free to air broadcaster will not cover an event and what Deputy Broughan warned against will happen.The qualifying broadcaster will not cover it and what Deputy Broughan warned against will happen. Sky Television will cover it and people will either have to pay to get the service or they will not be able to access it.I have two suggestions. Either the Minister accepts one of the amendments or else deletes section 6(a). I would not have a problem with that. If it were done, it would be self-evident to the court that it must take into account previous free-to-air television rates for events.I can understand the Minister's concern about being too prescriptive to the court. There is a danger of us trying to be too prescriptive because what we are trying to achieve could be distorted  by a clever barrister. If the Minister wishes to be less prescriptive, were he to get rid of section 6(a), I would have no problem with the rest of the section. However, if he insists on section 6(a), the requirement that the court must consider previous fees for the event or similar events is a misrepresentation of what we are trying to do, which is to get a sensible market rate based on previous experience within the marketplace of free-to-air television.I do not think anyone is trying to be political. There is a genuine concern that qualifying broadcasters will not be able to afford the rates set if they are set on the basis of previous events outside the free-to-air marketplace. We either need to get rid of section 6(a), remove the previous fees from the equation and assume it will come under section 6(f) where the court is required to consider such other matters as may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates. Previous fees are an obvious matter that would come under section 6(f). It is a case of either doing that or amending section 6(a) and trying to be more prescriptive about the marketplace at which this is aimed.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I am in favour of Deputy Broughan's amendment which adds the words, "the needs of free to air broadcasters", to the list of items the court must consider when setting a fair market rate. I know the Minister will quote section 6(f) but it is important this amendment is included. It copperfastens the direction of the Bill.The legislation calls on the High Court to take into account previous fees for the rights to an event when setting its judgment. Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment No. 11 specifies that the previous fees, if any, for non-exclusive rights to the event would be a determining factor. I am not sure about this. Had I been present for Committee Stage instead of being in Colombia looking after the rights of Irish people, I might have had more of an idea. Deputy Coveney's amendment No. 12 is better, is more clearly defined and I will support it.Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment No. 13 is good. It requires the High Court to take into account when making its determination on the size of the fee the amount of coverage given to the event by broadcasters generally. My understanding of that would be that TG4, which shows more GAA coverage, would get a better deal than TV3. It is a good amendment and I support it.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I will be brief. I wish to make one point in support of amendment No. 10 and the other amendments, especially Deputy Eamon Ryan's.I urge the Minister to accept the amendments for the following reason. I remember when the Télévision Sans Frontières directive was being negotiated that the tension within the college of commissioners was between the competition  commissioner and the cultural commissioner, which was then DG X. It arose because the defence of the qualification of the market contained in the directive was based on the term “event”, a term the Minister uses in the legislation. The competition commissioner was inclined to view something shown on television as a commodity. Therefore, the issue was whether competition was present in regard to something generated in a commodified market. The approach through DG X and our negotiations when I was Minister with responsibility for this area was that we were talking about an event. Therefore, it was necessary to consider the rights of viewers as part of a public watching something that was put on in the name of the nation. It was that view which prevailed.If the Minister wants the spirit of those negotiations to be carried through, it would make sense for him to arm the court and bodies which view these matters as events, for example, national broadcasters, by giving them something on which to latch their arguments. There is no question that there is a different relationship in the bidding process between those who carry the burden of a national orchestra, commitments to broadcasting in both languages, the operation of schedules across different networks, an obligation to the community and so forth, and those who are free, as Rupert Murdoch classically put it, to use sport as a battering ram through which to establish the type of monopoly he has in television.The Minister could strengthen his intention to preserve events for free-to-air television for the public by accepting the two crucial amendments Nos. 10 and 13. It is a valid point that, if soccer and sports at different levels are covered by a national service as part of the nation talking to itself, it is unreasonable that this would be impeded because of the cost of bidding in a pure market sense for a significant sporting event with a high advertising take. If the Minister does not accept the amendments, he or a future Minister will find themselves in the position of having to increase the licence fee to enable the national broadcaster to compete with the pure market operator or make subventions to enable it to bid. This is an entirely unreasonable expectation.The other point validly made is that we do not have an alternative to the qualified market as proposed in the amendments. We do not have a pure market. We have a market that is monopolistic in tendency. This effectively broke the ability of the European Broadcasting Union to offer significant events of a world kind, such as the Olympics and so on, for which the Kirch corporation effectively bid, acquired a monopoly and then went broke.I understand what Deputy Coveney says, namely, that if we want to allow any space to the court, the Minister would be better off without section 6(a) which steers it in the direction of an established benchmark. If the Minister will not accept the amendments, the least that he should do is drop section 6(a). If that is not possible, all  the amendments tabled will improve the legislation and keep it true to the principle of what the directive sought to achieve.From day one in all the negotiations, and I can only speak for the time when I had responsibility and the officials negotiating reported to me, the entire intention was to protect events for the public and to preserve the right of the culture commissioner to argue to the college of commissioners that this was not a matter of pure competition with a commodity. The outcome of the negotiations was to accept the principle that there could not be purely market considerations.Section 6(f) is not sufficiently strong. It states: “such other matters as may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates”. That does not take into account the burden that falls on free-to-air broadcasters, especially national broadcasters. Such issues would be language, general coverage and commitments to covering sport throughout the year. I strongly urge the Minister in the interests of the public and transposing the best intentions of the directive into Irish broadcasting legislation to accept these amendments.

I thank Deputy Michael Higgins for giving us a flavour of the type of scenario under which the directive came forward. Listening to him copperfastens my determination to proceed on this basis in that I can skew the market in favour of qualifying broadcasters in Ireland. I have legislative backing in this respect and I have justification for doing so because of the EU directive. That is where it should stop, however.The Deputy is pushing, by way of his amendment, the determination of what is a fair price in a particular direction. It is skewing it away from the event organiser in the direction of the qualifying broadcaster. That is why I said on Committee Stage that when one is giving a job to the High Court or an arbitrator, the broader and less specific the issues referred to, the better. If one puts down specific issues one will be favouring one side or the other. That is exactly what would happen if I were to accept any of the four amendments.The first of the four amendments refers to the needs of free to air broadcasters. Would the FAI not make the case in court? What about our needs? In effect, the Deputy is trying to intervene in a decision of an independent body as to what is a fair price and, at the same time, saying that the court or the arbitrator must take into account the needs, whatever they are, of the free to air broadcaster. What are those needs? If RTE was in a financial strait-jacket in years to come, would the court have to take that into account in determining a fair price? We are asking the court  to determine not what is a fair price for RTE but a fair price given the conflicting issues.

It would be obliged to accord it much more weight than the needs of the event organiser.Some of the other amendments are not necessary because the legislation is dealing with free to air issues. The fair market price would be based on non-exclusivity on free to air television so the previous price that Sky and the FAI had put in place would not come under—

That is what this legislation is about.Amendment No. 14 refers to the estimated production costs for coverage of an event. If other broadcasters were also getting rights, one might as well include that other broadcasters may be making a contribution to the qualifying broadcaster. One would have to take into account that a feed might be provided to other broadcasters outside the State for some of the games, which is normal international practice. If one accepted amendment No. 14, all those additional factors would have to be provided for.We are far better to put down broad principles and allow a court to come up with what is a reasonable price for all concerned. I accept the Deputies' bona fides, but they are, in effect, tying the hands of the adjudicator, the High Court or the arbitrator, in one direction as opposed to another. This would be unfair and probably open to challenge.I can intervene under an EU directive to say we are entitled to skew in favour of free to air broadcasters. However, if one is intervening to skew the determination of fair price in favour of one broadcaster over another, this is open to challenge and would possibly lead to legal action, which we would not want to happen.

It still goes to the core of the matter that the fundamental right of people to view the events in question will be exercised through free to air broadcasters. It is a basic right of communication. The events, from whatever sporting or cultural tradition, go beyond the province of the activities themselves and they become part of the cultural spirit of the nation.Listening to the debate we feel it would make more sense to remove paragraph (a), but if we are to be prescriptive – the Minister has been in respect of some points – why not accept the needs of the broadcaster? We need to take that into account if we are to ensure that the botched legislation of 1999, which I hope this Bill will correct, will work to the benefit of our national life.We made a very general provision because we felt it would give the arbitrator and the High Court the greatest range of action in relation to what might happen.

I do not see why the small amendment, which the Minister mentioned as a possibility on Committee Stage, cannot be accepted. I would happily withdraw amendment No. 14 if he felt we were meddling too much with the High Court's thinking.I would like to hear the Minister's response to amendment No. 13. Broadcasters that give a week in, week out commitment to national sports should be taken into account in some way when setting the rate for the once-off, more prestigious events. I am interested to hear the Minister's arguments against that principle. If it is not included in written form, as presented, I do not see how the High Court could possibly agree on the matter.It is not in the Council directive.

I do not like to disagree with Deputy Broughan but I would have some concerns about putting in a specific section saying that the court has to take into account the needs of free-to-air broadcasters and not balancing that  with the needs of the sporting bodies. That is what I have been trying to do all the way through.I agree with what the Minister has said but the wording of section 6(a) can be read in a different way and a case could be argued strongly in court. Let us take the example of the FAI again. The first thing the courts will look at when deciding on rates is previous fees paid for an event or similar events but there is no clarification in the Bill of what is meant here. The Minister has said, and I agree, that of course the courts are going to take previous events into account and will do so in the context of free-to-air television coverage of events. One could, however, argue the other case in court because of the lack of clarity in section 6(a).What is the Minister's problem with deleting section 6(a) entirely, for example, if he does not want to be overly prescriptive? Alternatively, my amendment No. 12 does not skew the decision process in favour of the broadcaster, or the event organiser for that matter. It merely clarifies the market in which the courts have to consider previous fees paid. That is all it says. It does not skew the decision-making process in favour of either side. The wording as exists at the moment is open to ambiguity, which could lead to problems.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I never conceded that the rights that would be argued for in arbitration constituted a property right. While sticking with this Bill tightly, the Minister could go some way towards meeting the spirit of the amendments by even agreeing to changes regarding section 6(f), which states, “such other matters that may appear to be relevant to fixing reasonable market rates.”  If this had stopped merely with the words, “such other matters that may appear to be relevant,” it would give some force to the case that the Minister has argued regarding article 3a of the Council directive.The difficulty the Minister has in his argument about section 6(e) is that when one takes into account the purposes of article 3a of the Council directive, the courts might well argue that the Minister had the opportunity to legislate under the directive, and in particular under article 3a, but chose not to do so and is now limited to that for which he has legislated. If section 6(f) had been shorter than it is at present, the Minister would have been free to draw on section 6(e) in a court case. In limiting section 6(f) by saying, “to fixing reasonable market rates,” the Minister has so circumscribed it that he has cut off all the ground available to him in section 6(e), and I ask him to give consideration to that point.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I do not want to repeat myself, but in general, in giving a job over to the High Court or an arbitrator, we have to be balanced and to allow them to get on with the job and determine matters as they see fit. I could not agree to delete the words "previous fees" from section 6(a). As regards the point Deputy  Coveney and, I think, Deputy Broughan were trying to make about non-exclusivity, that is taken care of in section 6(e), which states that account must be taken of the purposes of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.I do not see the point that Deputy M. Higgins is making in relation to section 6(f) but nor do I think that the words, “to fixing reasonable market rates”, are that relevant. Thus, I would be prepared, if you will allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, to agree to delete the words, “to fixing reasonable market rates”, from the end of section 6(f). I do not think they are relevant. I do not think they should go for the reasons Deputy M. Higgins has outlined, I just think the words are superfluous.

The sixth factor, section 6(f), in effect covers other matters that may appear to be relevant to the court. From that point of view, I could agree to make that change if that is acceptable.Deputy Ryan made a point about the level of sports coverage provided by the broadcasters as a whole. Let us take an example where RTE has broadcast the entire championship leading up to the all-Ireland final and TV3 comes along and says it wants access to the all-Ireland final. By including Deputy Ryan's provision we would, to a certain extent, skew the process in favour of one of the two broadcasters in the determination of a fair market price, and the GAA would be the determinant as to which of the two organisations would get the event. The price would be fixed and the GAA could then determine that there would be exclusive rights for one of the organisations only. To a certain extent, therefore, putting that provision in would skew the process in such a way that we could not have fairness, particularly regarding the amount that a broadcaster might be required to pay.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I thank the Chair for facilitating me and I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in the House. I have raised this matter with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, but I am glad that the Minister of State is here. I hope he will convey to the Minister my deep concern about this matter.Although I am raising my concerns because I have a particular Tallaght perspective, this issue does not relate to Tallaght only. I am asking the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to provide urgently needed funding, through FÁS and the social economy scheme, to enable a long-established community training project in Tallaght to continue in operation. Syscom Computer Training Limited is a registered company that was established by the Tallaght ICTU centre for the unemployed, which was founded in 1987 as part of the response by the trade union movement to the unemployment crisis that prevailed at that time. The centre was established alongside the Programme for National Recovery which was agreed by the social partners in the 1980s.Syscom was established to provide high quality training and development services to unemployed people, to provide educational and training facilities that are of relevance to such people, to support the long-term unemployed in their efforts to return to the workforce and to help individuals to gain new skills and to develop existing skills. Since its establishment in 1991, Syscom has provided 8,000 course places in Tallaght. It has been staffed by part-time community employment and full-time job initiative personnel during that period. Its one full-time staff member, the manager, who has been continuously employed since its inception, also functions as a part-time tutor. I had the pleasure of bringing the manager and some of her colleagues to meet the Taoiseach last year. I impressed on the Taoiseach the importance of this scheme, which I have been happy to support as an elected representative of Tallaght.The termination of payments expected under the second phase of the community access to IT scheme, which was inaugurated by the former Minister for communications, Senator O'Rourke, removed the possibility of the support for which this project had been already favourably assessed by the Department. The provision for the gradual roll-out of the social economy and its use to replace places hitherto provided under the community employment scheme, as envisaged in the PPF, provided an alternative source of support. Syscom has provided all necessary information and a detailed and updated business plan for FÁS as part of its application for such support. I understand that FÁS has verbally indicated that it has no available resources to cover further projects in Tallaght. I remind the House that Tallaght is the third largest centre of population in Ireland.The reduction of community employment schemes and numbers being carried out by FÁS, together with the continuing uncertainty among surviving schemes as to their continuation, has led to the postponement or reduction of normal spending by community employment projects on IT training. This will lead to a reduction in the skills of the workforce at a time when skills are urgently needed. Syscom is faced with an immediate crisis, therefore. In the absence of support, it is being forced to close down, in spite of the need  for IT training in Tallaght and its long and proven record in delivering a quality service to the community, including recognised qualifications such as the ECDL and NCVA awards.I wish to make clear to the Minister of State that this is an important issue for Tallaght. It is important that this House demonstrates its strong support for people who need it. As I have outlined, Syscom has provided tremendous service to the community over a long period. Some 8,000 people have benefited and it would be a shame to pick on such people in this time of spending constraints. I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment my serious concerns, as a representative of Tallaght and the Dublin South-West constituency. I hope that I can look forward to progress in this regard. I appreciate the attendance and support of the Minister of State,
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I thank Deputy O'Connor for raising this issue and for providing me with an opportunity to outline the roles of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS in the administration of this relatively new scheme. Annual allocations under the FÁS social economy programme are provided in the context of the Estimates through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is also responsible for the scheme's overall policy direction. The management of the scheme, including the regional breakdown of the funding and the approval of grants for individual social economy enterprises, are day-to-day operational matters for the board of FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987.The social economy programme was introduced in September 2000 to tap into employment or income generating opportunities that might be available in the social economy sector. FÁS provides start-up capital, for up to three years, to social economy enterprises that create permanent sustainable employment for certain disadvantaged groups. The jobs supported within social economy enterprises are primarily aimed at long-term unemployed persons over the age of 35 and other disadvantaged persons, such as Travellers and those in receipt of disability allowance. There is a 10% exemption, however, for other persons who do not meet the normal eligibility criteria, including women in households that depend on welfare. The social economy programme operates as a national programme with a specific localised focus on the 38 disadvantaged areas designated by Government for specific supports.At local level the decision-making process is two-tiered and is operated through FÁS community services unit and social economy local working groups. The latter group comprises representatives of FÁS and area partnership companies, relevant statutory bodies such as health boards and local authority, local community and voluntary interests, ICTU and local employers  and other appropriate bodies. The role of the local working groups is to identify and prioritise areas of social economy activity, which will enhance the regeneration of the local area. Local working groups advise and make recommendations to FÁS on specific funding applications under the social economy programme.The 2003 allocation for the social economy programme (SEP) was set during the Estimates campaign and was announced in the Dáil by the Minister in November 2002. The allocations have increased from €6.62 million in 2001, to €20.55 million in 2002 and stand at €30.836 million in 2003. Notwithstanding the considerable pressures this year on current Government expenditure, the allocation to the social economy programme was increased by 50%. This funds more than 2000 grant-supported employees in over 300 enterprises. This increased allocation to FÁS will enable them to meet commitments under the programme. However, this substantially increased allocation is not sufficient to meet all the demands from sponsors for new projects. This year will be a period of consolidation for the programme with a focus on enhancing the sustainability and viability of established social economy enterprises.FÁS is currently meeting promoters of individual projects approved under the programme to discuss the roll-out of funding in 2003. FÁS has assured the Department that it will finance all commitments made to the enterprises already approved.A review of the social economy programme is currently being undertaken, which is expected to be completed in July 2003. This review will inform the future direction of the programme. In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that a cross-departmental senior officials' group has been asked to consider options for the future provision of community services, having regard to the contribution now being made by community employment and concerns expressed by the social partners and key stakeholders.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this serious issue on the Adjournment of the House. The IFI plant in the Cork harbour area closed some months ago with the loss of hundreds of jobs. I submitted this matter for the Adjournment debate early this morning to the office of the Ceann Comhairle. I expected that the Minister, Deputy Harney, or one of her junior Ministers would be in the House to address the issue of the problems in the ADM plant in Ringaskiddy, County Cork. It is unacceptable that neither the Minister nor her junior Minister is in the House tonight. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is a courteous man. I presume he will read out a script in response. I find it unacceptable that none of  the 12 Fianna Fáil Members from Cork city and county are in the House to speak on an issue of fundamental importance to the economy of the Cork region. I wonder if I am wasting my time in raising this matter. The arrogance and indifference of this Government is unbelievable. It believes it has four more years to go before an election and if ADM goes down the tubes it will be long forgotten by then.I want to highlight the plight of the workers in ADM, 80 of whom have been locked out since 5 March 2003. This situation has put 75 members of different unions out of work. They are workers represented by SIPTU, APT branch, TEEU and AEEU.The company met with union representatives in February and outlined its need to change work practices and procedures. The union wanted to discuss the ramifications of such changes but the ADM management refused saying that the changes were non-negotiable. The union committee suggested that management should speak to the workers. Union meetings were called and the overwhelming majority of SIPTU branch two workers voted against the company proposals. The union officials suggested that the case be referred either to the Labour Relations Commission or to a full Labour Court hearing. The company refused and this was a breach of current company-union agreement and also in breach of the partnership criteria.Most of the employees are shareholders in the company and have an average of about 25 years service. The company insisted on the implementation of the changes on 5 March 2003 regardless. When workers arrived for work that morning, senior management stood at the entrance and refused them admission. They were locked out and denied due process. That is an incredible situation in 2003.The workers applied for social welfare benefits from 5 March and some have not yet received any decision and some have been refused social welfare payments. On 13 March 2003, the company informed the workers that they had been temporarily laid off. In all that time they received not one cent from the company or from the State. Many of those workers have contributed to the State for 40 years and more. They are being denied their rights by the Government in their hour of need. A deaf ear is being given to the behaviour of the company. The workers and their families have been demoralised by the company. They are suffering the stress and anxiety of being without work and severe financial hardship.I am appealing to the Government to take immediate action to remedy the situation. I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister to arrange talks between the company and union representatives. Cork cannot take any more of this type of behaviour from this Government.

This dispute arose when the company sought agreement to introduce a restructuring plan, including new rostering arrangements. The new arrangements were due to come into effect in early March 2003. The conciliation service of the Labour Relations Commission was asked to intervene between management and staff representatives due to difficulties in introducing the new arrangements. On 5 March 2003 an officer of the commission met with representatives of staff and management. The outcome of these discussions was rejected by SIPTU. The company then announced its intention to close the plant for a temporary period in order to facilitate a review of plant operations. Operations at the Ringaskiddy plant ceased on 10 March last.The company indicated to workers that the review would have regard to the overall operations, the business and economic position and industrial relations in the company and undertook to make its intentions known when the review had been completed. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment understands that the review is still in progress and that no announcement has been made regarding the future of the Ringaskiddy plant.It is disappointing that all the jobs at the plant could be at risk as a result of an industrial dispute, particularly in light of the failure of management and the unions to achieve a solution to the impasse, despite the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission. The loss of these jobs would be a major blow to the local economy.The Minister has stated in this House on previous occasions that it would not be appropriate to intervene in such disputes. Instead, the parties should utilise the expert services of the dispute-settlement machinery in order to avoid continuing disruption and hardship. The experience and expertise of these services are available free of charge to disputing parties and offer them the best avenue for resolving their differences. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the parties concerned to ensure that agreement is reached.The ADM plant in Ringaskiddy has been in operation for more than 30 years and has made an enormous contribution to the economy of the area. I am confident that, with goodwill on both sides, there will be a positive outcome following the company's review of operations and that the plant will continue in operation for many years to come.

In past centuries, when we lived under the depths of a repressive regime, our ancestors found it inspiring that people in other lands at least raised the key issues and key sufferings of our people.More than 30% of the Republic of Turkey is the homeland of the Kurdish people who now number in the region of 20 million of just over 60 million in the Turkish State. For most of the history of modern Turkey, from 1922 to 1925, the Kurdish people have been repressed in cultural and linguistic terms in relation to their rights to broadcast and free assembly. Like ourselves, in the lead up to the Treaty of Versailles, they expected to have an independent Kurdistan or, as they were promised by Kemal Ataturk, the rights of autonomy of, say, Scotland within the United Kingdom. After 1925 they were cruelly disabused of this. I raised the issue earlier in the Dáil with the Minister, Deputy Cowen. Obviously, in recent years, Turkey has had a European destiny, which I welcome. Eventually it will be a sister state of ours. However, it is vitally important for Ireland to ensure that as the accession protocol is worked through, the demands we make in relation to the civil, political, religious and other rights of the Kurdish people of the Turkish state are fully realised.The new Government of Tayip Erdogan and his justice and development party have promised major reforms. While they have abolished the death penalty and lifted some of the restrictions on broadcasting in the Kurdish language, the position for Kurdish civil society is very difficult. Up to 2004, when the Taoiseach will make a decision on Turkey, we must insist that the rights of the Kurdish people are recognised, at least on the basis of an autonomous state, which they were promised. Kurdistan is the great nation of Saladin. It has a glorious mediaeval 3000 year history like ours. Following the horrible war in Iraq, there may be the development of an autonomous Kurdish homeland in Iraq. It is important that the Kurdish people of Turkey also get freedom.I want to turn to the situation in Chechnya. This is a very small country and territory within the Russian Federation. It is approximately the size of Munster with a population of one million people. The Danish human rights and refugee body which is active in the country estimates that there are only 750,000 Chechnyans in their homeland at the moment. Just like Turkey, Russia has a great European destiny, one of the greatest centres of European civilisation. I welcome the achievements of the Russian people in the 20th  century, including the massive impact they had, particularly in defeating fascism, and the strides that have been made under President Putin. It must be said, however, that a ferocious and savage war has been fought in Chechnya. There has been a recent referendum to try to establish a normal civil state. The powers given to the Chechnyan people are still extremely limited. The President can be dismissed at will by the Russian President.If the Russian Federation is to develop into a real federation on the basis of the United States or Germany, it is crucial that the Chechnyan people get their full civil rights and that the policies and brutal campaigns carried out during the 1990s are discontinued. It is estimated that at least 5,000 young Russian men and women died in these battles, some 250,000 people have been displaced and there has been intense suffering. There was the horrendous seizure of the theatre in Moscow when 129 innocent people died and the administration building in Grozny was blown up.It is crucial that our small country is prepared to say to a sister European country, a joint federation of 145 million people, that we are not happy about the events which have taken place in Chechnya in the past ten years and that we expect a European state to behave in a democratic way.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I thank the Deputy for raising these questions. I wish to comment separately on the two distinct issues, namely, the situation in Chechnya and the situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey, which are referred to in the motion for the adjournment this evening. As regards Chechnya, I assure the House that the Government remains very concerned about the human rights situation there and the prospects for a peace settlement. Clearly a settlement would improve the humanitarian situation of ordinary Chechen people who have been affected by the conflict. Since 1997, Ireland has allocated nearly €1.7 million for humanitarian assistance to the civilian population there which has been channelled through international aid agencies operating on the ground and in the region.Together with our EU partners, we have repeatedly made clear that the development of EU relations with Russia should be based on respect for human rights and the principles of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. While we acknowledge the right of the Government of the Russian Federation to defend its territorial integrity, to overcome terrorism and crime and to protect its population, we believe the fight against terrorism in the Russian Federation as elsewhere must be conducted in accordance with internationally-accepted human rights standards. Consequently, the Government continues to work with partners in the EU, the OSCE and the Council of Europe to encourage progress towards a political settlement in Chechnya and to encourage respect for  the rule of law and an end to the culture of impunity.The EU tabled a resolution on the human rights situation in Chechnya for the UN Commission on Human Rights, UNCHR, in Geneva earlier this month which we hope will be adopted. Another key outstanding issue on the human rights front relates to the request from the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, the current chairman in office of the OSCE, to the Russian side to re-open a permanent OSCE presence in Chechnya. Discussion on this issue will take place in Moscow later this month and Ireland is strongly supporting the Netherlands efforts on this important issue.My colleague and Minister with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, raised the Chechnya issue at the European Union Council of Ministers in Brussels yesterday. He specifically asked the Presidency to see how best to have a review of the situation in Chechnya included on the agenda of the EU Russia summit which will take place in St. Petersburg on 31 May 2003. The St. Petersburg summit will be attended by heads of state or Government of all EU member states and we hope that the agenda can encompass dialogue with Russia on all important issues, including the situation in Chechnya.The Minister also sought an up-date on Chechnya from the Deputy Russian Minster for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Chizhov, when he met him in Dublin last week. The Minister indicated that the situation was improving in Chechnya and the Minister, Deputy Roche, mentioned the importance of having an inclusive political dialogue in developing a sustainable peace process.Ireland hopes that the referendum which took place on 23 March may mark a first step towards a political solution to the Chechnyan conflict and that the recent steps towards democratisation and the rule of law may be maintained. Some commentators consider the result as a clear expression of a yearning for hope and a profound longing for peace among the ordinary Chechen population, while the validity of the result has been questioned by human rights NGOs. The timetable now is for presidential elections in December 2003 followed by parliamentary elections in 2004.We note with interest recent significant political statements by President Putin that have acknowledged the need for the military to respect the civilian population, the importance of reaching an agreement between Chechnya and Moscow and compensation for civilians who have lost their properties or business. These statements have also highlighted the need for reconstruction as a priority as well as the fact that consideration is being given to some form of amnesty. We look forward to practical follow-ups on these important statements that could provide a basis for a new, conditional EU engagement to assist democratisation, recovery and a political settlement to the benefit of all the ordinary people of Chechnya.Ireland will continue to work for decisive advances across the broad front of relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation. A close and fruitful relationship between the two is necessary to ensure stability and progress on the Eurasian landmass and beyond.The conflict in Iraq has heightened the concerns of Kurdish populations in the region. It has also once again drawn international public attention to the situation of Kurds in Iraq and neighbouring states. The Government has been concerned at the potential impact of the conflict on Kurdish populations. While the situation in northern Iraq appears to be stabilising, we continue to urge all governments involved to exercise the greatest care to ensure that the rights and physical security of these populations are fully respected.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The Minister of State may understandably feel beleaguered today given that the House has already discussed the dispute of public health doctors, a Private Members' motion on the equality of cancer care services and I am now raising the position of psychological services within the health service. This is currently subject to an intensive lobby of all public representatives by psychologists in all areas of the country.The arguments are both basic and valid. They describe how staff shortages are impacting on service delivery throughout the country. Vulnerable adults and children are not receiving an adequate range of services. Children entrusted to health board care are not receiving adequate psychological services. Health boards are storing up a medium and long-term financial burden because of a failure to deliver these psychological services.The Minister for Health and Children has earned a reputation of initiating a number of reports and reviews. While on the surface the need to inform and find out the circumstances that exist in the health service is necessary, the amount of reports and reviews undertaken and the failure to act on them is an indictment of the failure of the Minister, the Ministers of State and the Department.The state of the psychological services is a good example of this. In 1994, those involved in psychological services lobbied for a review to be undertaken, this was agreed to in 1995 and the review was finally put in place in 1999. The grounds for such a review were: difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified psychologists; staff shortages were seriously impacting on service delivery; a number of existing posts were inadequate to meet the need and range of psychological services for vulnerable adults and children; and that children entrusted to the care of health boards were, in many cases, not receiving any psychological service at all. As the terms of reference for the review, these are also the criticisms that can be levelled at the Government today for  its failure to properly resource psychological services within the health service.The main difficulty is the 40% shortage of psychologists in the country. This can vary from region to region. My colleague, Deputy Gogarty, tells me that the shortage is 64% in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and it is higher again in the South-Western Area Health Board. I have seen how real these difficulties are in the Southern Health Board area and how the Government's promise of 50 training places annually was met by providing only two last year.The final report of the review on psychological services within the health service was delivered in March 2002. It made a number of recommendations that the Government has not implemented 13 months later, nor has it put in place any mechanisms that would allow them to be implemented.I will cite a number of the recommendations and ask the Minister of State how the Government intends to respond to this real need. The recommendations included: the commitment to bring the number of training places to 50 per year; the need to allow clinical psychologists to be clinicians, rather than administrators, in assessing people; the establishment of the post of director for clinical psychologist in each health board; and the need to establish principal posts in each community care area. Given the shortfalls in the training system and the numbers that need to take up those places, what are the Government's medium and short-term plans to meet and seek to reduce the number of vacant posts in the psychological services?I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this cannot continue. For many of the people in need of these services, it means we are intensifying problems that could be easily solved by the required political will.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I would like to outline to the House the good progress that has already been made in implementing key recommendations of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services. Following the publication of the report of the joint review group in March 2002, a major priority for the Department of Health and Children was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing substantial increases in the number of principal and director level clinical psychologist posts.Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, the Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that  the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how the boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending. This is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003. Given these constraints the Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning. This is being secured through the continued provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase since end-1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand  and supply in human resource and service provision.The Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services as detailed in the joint review group's report.A particular priority is to secure the best return in terms of graduate output on the very significant financial resources currently invested in psychology training. In this context, the Department has recently initiated a review, to be completed in the coming months, with a sub-group of the directors of the human resources group of the current training model for postgraduate psychology training. The main objective of the review is to underpin the maintenance and development of training provision on a planned and sustainable basis into the future.In light of the foregoing, the House will note that good progress is being achieved in addressing the range of recommendations contained in the joint review group report.The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 April 2003.

The designation of universal service providers and the obligations imposed on them are set out in the European Communities (Voice Telephony and Universal Service) Regulations 1999 (S.I. No. 71 of 1999). It is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation, or ComReg, as the independent regulator for the communications sector, to implement this legislation. I have no function in relation to the implementation of the universal service obligations.The legislation places obligations on the designated universal service operator to ensure that a defined minimum set of services of specified quality are available to all, independently of their geographical location, at an affordable price. While the governing legislation on universal service provision will be revised in accordance with a new universal service directive which is to be transposed into national law by 25 July 2003, the universal service obligations which I have just described will continue to be applied and enforced by ComReg. On the other hand, as Minister I am empowered to impose a levy equivalent to the cost of replanting. This option may be availed of by a developer as an alternative to the purchasing and planting of another site.

There are over 140 ship registers in operation world-wide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state. I am advised that the practice of using flags of convenience, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is still permissible under international law.As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibilities in relation to the Irish Ship Register – that is, for Irish registered ships – the operations of other ship registers is governed by applicable national and international law. I have no statutory functions in relation to seafarers wages.Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Irelands port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation and, in relation to seafarers social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's maritime conventions, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.My Department has completed a strategic and operational review of maritime safety regulatory services in October 2000 and its recommendations are now being implemented. A Maritime Safety Directorate was established in February 2002 and an additional nine vessel surveyors were recruited to the marine survey office, which is an integral part of the new directorate.Inspections of foreign ships under the Directive 95/21/EC, on port state control have increased from 14.6% in 2000 and 21% in 2001 to 30% in 2002. Up to end of March 2003, 128 ships have been inspected and 14 were detained for non-compliance with international safety requirements. Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. Ireland will continue to support efforts in all appropriate fora to enhance working conditions for seafarers on board flags of convenience and indeed all vessels and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework.

It is some 30 kilometres long by some eight kilometres wide, about 45 kilometres from the Cork coast and about 20 kilometres south west of the Kinsale Head Bravo platform at its nearest. It lies within water depths ranging from 97 metres to 104 metres. The Seven Heads gas field was declared commercial in July 2002 and a lease demising the petroleum to Ramco Seven Heads Limited and its co-venturers, Island Petroleum Development Limited, Northern Exploration and Sunningdale Oils (Ireland) Limited issued on 13 November 2002.Under the terms of the lease, a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement had to be submitted by the developers for the Minister's approval before any development could take place. The plan of development together with the environmental impact statement was submitted to me for my approval on 6 December 2002. On 12 March 2003 I approved the plan of development for the Seven Heads gas field under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and I also gave consent to construct a pipeline for the development under the Gas Act 1976, as amended.The field development plan is for a six well sub-sea development tied back by a 34 kilometres 18" pipeline to the Kinsale Alpha platform operated by Marathon International Petroleum Limited. Agreements are in place that permit Ramco to use Marathon's existing Kinsale offshore facilities and the export pipeline to the Inch terminal. Development costs are estimated at around €200 million. The field has a forecast production of around 300bcf. and an estimated economic life of 15 years to 2018. First gas is forecast for October 2003.

EU funding for the charter ended in 2000. I understand that Cork County Council agreed to meet the cost of the project through the years 2001 and 2002. The charter advised me, however, that Cork County Council would no longer be in a position to meet the full costs of the charter office on an ongoing basis beyond February 2003. The charter, therefore, put forward a proposal that its costs be met by a number of public bodies.  In addition to my Department, it also sought funding from my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Agriculture and Food, as well as Cork County Council and Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has advised the charter that it might pursue the possibility of funding for the project through the LEADER programmes.I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very useful work undertaken by the charter, and to assure all concerned that, in developing integrated coastal zone management at a national level, careful account will be taken of the pioneering work in Bantry.

This is in accordance with the consistent position of the Irish Government that the relevant Regulations 685/95 and 2027/95 governing the Irish Box continue in place and have full legal effect. Accordingly, the Irish authorities are continuing to monitor activity within the Irish Box closely. To date the level of activity by Spanish vessels in the Irish Box has remained below the 40 vessels at any one time threshold in the regulations.The Deputy will be aware that the Commission has tabled a proposal providing for a new effort management regime in western waters. This proposal, presented in December to replace the current EU regulations, is unacceptable to Ireland and I completely reject it. I have made strong representations to Minister Drys, the Greek Fisheries Minister who currently holds the Presidency of the Fisheries Council to have Ireland's priorities reflected in a compromise text. I have also impressed on Commissioner Fischler, at a meeting with him in Strasbourg on the 12 March, that the current Commission proposal does not provide a basis on which to proceed. A different approach is clearly necessary in order to address the over-riding conservation objective in this sensitive biological area.While Commissioner Fischler appeared to appreciate the case made, I am very concerned that recent soundings of the Commission's thinking are not satisfactorily addressing my priorities. Following further contacts last week with Commissioner Fischler, I have agreed a further meeting with him in the light of the lack of progress on this critical issue.

In the meantime, my Department will progress key recommendations made by the consultant aimed at improving management and operational aspects of the Coast Guard on the ground. It continues to be my objective to ensure that Coast Guard services in the marine environment and in inland areas are efficient and effective and represent value for money in accordance with international best practice.

It is of vital importance that we establish correct terms of reference for the proposed review, as this ultimately determines the success of the outcome of the exercise.

Ireland claims an extended continental shelf, beyond 200 nautical miles and up to 500 nautical miles, particularly in the Hatton-Rockall area. As Ireland is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it is required to make a submission on its extended continental shelf claim to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, CLCS. Ireland's claim is supported, I believe, by data which Ireland has collected and interpreted and which will be included in its submission.The Hatton-Rockall extended continental shelf area is also claimed by Iceland and the Faroes. Since the CLCS has no mandate regarding issues of delimitation between neighbouring states, and cannot consider an area under dispute without the agreement of all the parties concerned, Ireland has been participating in informal discussions with Iceland and the Faroes in an attempt to reach some resolution of this dispute, before making our submission to the CLCS. The outer limit approved by the CLCS will be the outer limit of Ireland's continental shelf exploration rights. Ireland is working to make its submission to the CLCS by 2006.

As I stated in my reply to Question No. 169 of 4 March, I will then initiate a public consultation process, inviting submissions from interested parties in relation to the draft charter. To facilitate debate in the matter, I will establish an on-line forum on my Department's website.The purpose of the charter is to provide an understanding to the people of Ireland of what is expected of RTE in return for the significant public funds provided to RTE from the proceeds of the television licence fee. Broadcasting law requires RTE's radio and television services to have the character of a public service, to be offered free-to-air and to be universally available, where practicable, to the whole community of the island of Ireland. Building on RTE's statutory remit the charter is a statement of principles that clarifies what is expected of RTE as the national public service broadcaster, including RTE's accountability to its audience. I look forward to the debate that publication of the charter will give rise to.

Both local authorities rank the Youghal coast protection scheme as the number one priority in the county. The total cost of the scheme as proposed is estimated at €6 million.In 2003 the Exchequer provision for coast protection works is €1.072 million. This money has been fully allocated. I would like to inform the Deputy that in January, I approved an Exchequer contribution of €120,000 to Cork County Council to facilitate the provision of beach groynes at the Warren strand, Roscarberry. This project had commenced in 2002.

Primary responsibility for the conservation and protection of inland fisheries rests with the local fisheries board, in this case the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board. I have asked the chief executive officer of that board to advise the Deputy of the protection measures in place.

Also, I am supportive of efforts to develop wind farms as a source of energy. It is necessary for me, therefore, to balance these important policy directions.Following consultations between the renewable energy division and the forest service of my Department, I have now approved revised arrangements for the consideration by my Department of applications for the construction of wind farms on forestry sites. These arrangements will provide the necessary certainty for wind farm developers while respecting forestry principles. Importantly, they will not involve additional cost for the wind farm developer.

While there have been some speculative movements both upwards and downwards in oil prices surrounding the war situation and unrelated supply difficulties in Venezuela and Nigeria, there was no evidence of the war affecting supplies. Crude prices are much lower now than they were in early March. Since there are no supply problems at present, the question of response measures does not arise.

Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on the details of the case in question. On the issue of observers generally, there is no such general system currently in place in EU waters under the Common Fisheries Policy. It has however been agreed that an observer system should be introduced by member states in respect of certain  deep-sea fisheries. We are currently engaged in planning such a system.It would not be realistic to place total reliance on observer schemes for the purposes of monitoring catches and stock conservation. A range of other control and enforcement instruments such as logbooks, the application of satellite technology, port-side controls and inspections generally is already in place to support such objectives and these instruments are likely to continue to be the mainstay in monitoring catches.

The concept behind ENUM allows telecommunications users, be they private or business users, to create a table containing a list of all their contact details using different technologies i.e. fixed landline, mobile, fax, voice over IP, Internet, etc. The availability of such a table would allow any telecommunications user in the world to look up the contact information of the person they want to contact and to choose the most cost effective way of contacting them. This technology will facilitate increased competition between operators and help to reduce telecommunications costs.My Department is currently in discussion with the International Telecommunications Union to arrange for the necessary protocols to be put in place to enable the carrying out of ENUM trials in Ireland. Once these discussions are complete I expect to be in a position to facilitate trials.

The maritime safety directorate requested interested parties to respond by 31 December 2002. However, in order to encourage the widest possible participation in the consultation process replies were accepted until the end of January 2003.More than 100 submissions were received and the Deputy will appreciate that these required detailed and careful consideration. The preliminary results have been collated and a report is now being drafted on the outcome of the review. When I receive the report and its recommendations, I will bring forward proposals for any necessary legislative change as quickly as possible thereafter.As part of this review, the directorate has already brought forward the date for implementation of new safety regulations for passenger boats. A number of information seminars have also been organised to promote these new regulations. In addition, the directorate is also completing an examination of regulations applicable to larger domestic passenger ships and a consultation paper will be issued shortly in this regard.

Under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 the board is required to publish a report of any investigation it undertakes into a marine casualty after having sought and received the observations of parties likely to be adversely affected by publishing the report. The Act provides for a copy of the boards report to be transmitted to me as soon as it is published.Under the statutory consultation procedure, a substantial volume of submissions and comments were submitted to the board to the extent that the board prepared a revised draft report. A copy of that revised draft has been issued to all parties likely to be adversely affected by its publication. I am advised that the board expects to be in a position to publish the report next month.

This projected capacity requirement has been identified in the most recent forecast statement, entitled Generation Adequacy Report 2003-09, which was published by ESB national grid in November 2002, in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.The CER, in exercise of its responsibilities, announced on 20 December 2002 that, following extensive consultation and having examined a number of options, it was of the view that the most appropriate approach to securing additional capacity is to award a contract to one or more successful bidders, through a competitive process for the purchase of 300 megawatts to 400 megawatts of electricity. The CER is also of the view that ESB, operating as the public electricity supplier, PES, is best placed in the market to offer such a contract.

As indicated in a previous reply, the airport authorities, in mid-December 2002, gave notice to my Department that the sole passenger operator at Waterford airport intended to cease operations on 26 January 2003. As a result of this, the airport authority was unable to provide the necessary support to enable a 24-hour service to operate there from that date.Since then, the airport has been in discussions with my Department regarding the provision of a 24 hour search and rescue service. It has also been in close contact with the Department of Transport regarding the future development of the airport. I understand that a conclusion to these discussions is imminent and I believe it will be possible to commence the 24-hour service shortly. In the meantime, the Irish Coast Guard is continuing to operate a 12 hour search and rescue service from Waterford airport and 24 hour cover is being provided from Dublin airport.

The provision, promotion and pricing of communications infrastructure and services, including Internet access, is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.My Department is exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and Wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way. Five projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	692	One of the key objectives of the regulatory framework governing the telecommunications sector is to improve competition among operators in the sector. The regulatory framework includes a number of provisions to enhance competition among broadband and internet providers. Among these provisions is the requirement on operators with significant market power in the fixed public telephone networks to allow unbundled access to the local loop. This provision is important in enabling the competitive provision of DSL services to customers. Competition in the supply of DSL services is now under way in the Irish market.In relation to dial-up access to the Internet, competitive provision of flat-rate dial-up services will shortly be in place in the Irish market. This follows my policy direction to the Commission for Communications Regulation to put in place the provision of retail flat-rate dial-up internet access services. Comreg used its powers to bring about the provision by Eircom of what is known as FRIACO, a wholesale service to operators to enable flat-rate retail products to be offered to consumers.The regulatory framework has recently been reformed at EU level and currently my Department is engaged in the transposition of the Electronic Communications Regulatory Package into Irish law. Transposition of the new framework into national law must be completed by 25 July this year and I expect that Ireland will have completed the necessary work on time.This new regulatory framework is intended to provide a coherent, reliable and flexible approach to the regulation of electronic communication networks and services. The framework focuses regulation on areas where competition is insufficient and provides a lighter regulatory touch where markets have become more competitive. It will be a matter for Comreg to evaluate the state of competition in the sector, including the provision of broadband and internet access and, as appropriate, to impose regulatory obligations in order to bring about effective competition.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	693	The reference in the Deputy's question to reported concerns of business leaders is somewhat vague. It is important to note, however, that the electricity market in Ireland is in a transitional phase at present. The market is moving from a de facto monopoly with a single player towards a competitive market in an industry with relatively long lead times for investment. Such change needs to be conceived and effected in an orderly and measured manner, in order to ensure that the benefits are lasting and long-term.Confusion may exist about the relationship between the liberalisation of the electricity market and the rebalancing of tariffs. Tariffs rose by a total of only 3.5% in nominal terms between 1986 and 2001, well below inflation, leading to a situation where eventually generation costs were being under-recovered and grid investment was postponed. As the process of rebalancing has been conducted in parallel with the first steps of liberalisation, it could be perceived that there has been a cause and effect, normally that, the market has been opened and, in response to this, prices for consumers have risen. This is not the case.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	694	In March 2002 the interdepartmental working group on  telecommunications recommended the design and construction of metropolitan area networks in towns and cities across the country, and the setting up of a number of trials of alternative technologies, such as wireless local area networks. Some 19 locations were recommended for the construction of metropolitan area networks, namely, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Ballina, Athlone, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Clonmel, Roscommon, Letterkenny, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Bunbeg.Funding of over €64 million has been committed to these projects over the two years 2003 and 2004. These projects will all commence construction within this year, with completion by mid-2004. Four of the networks, Cork, Galway, Ballina and Limerick, are now in the construction phase.Trials of wireless local area networks are under way in a number of locations, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Westport, Sligo and the North-East. A final report on these trials is expected in October 2003.A modern, high-speed, low-cost communications network is an essential enabler of economic activity and social inclusion. The widespread availability of open-access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure and services for businesses and citizens is a priority for the Government and my Department.On 21 February last, I issued a set of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation focusing on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat-rate internet access call origination, known as FRIACO. This will be introduced before the end of June 2003. Also, a number of communications companies offering DSL services have recently announced major reductions in the prices of their broadband services bringing the cost of DSL in line with the European norm. This should help increase significantly the level of interest in broadband uptake in this country.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The Government had to make some very difficult decisions in preparing the 2003 public finances. This resulted in a reduction in the level of funding available for a range of Government funded programmes, including the forestry programme. In the changed budgetary situation, the prioritising of the plant ing programme meant that it was not possible to meet all requests for funding from the forestry budget this year.I am conscious of the contribution the Tree Council and Crann have made to the development of forestry in Ireland. The forestry service has been happy to support both organisations over the years. I appreciate that the withdrawal of funding may impact adversely on their activities in the short-term. However, my Department must operate within budget and prioritise expenditure accordingly.This Government remains fully committed to the long-term development of the forestry sector. The situation in relation to the Tree Council and Crann will be re-examined in the context of the 2004 estimates discussions later this year.In relation to the native woodland scheme and the neighbour wood scheme, the allocation for 2003 is €870,000. The financial allocation for these schemes over the next three years will be determined during the annual estimates process for those years. It should be recognised however that expenditure on all programmes must respect the public expenditure ceiling set by the Government and must take account of wider budgetary priorities.

Ireland is one of 161 participating countries to the convention, which in our case was ratified by Government on 8 January 2002 and entered into force on 8 April 2002. CITES operates by subjecting international trade in selected species to certain controls which require that all import, export, re-export of species covered by the convention to a licensing system. In Irelands case the management authority in charge of the licensing system is Dúchas.

My Department has on hands applications for state mining facilities for both of these extensions. I remain hopeful for the continuation of mining on this site for many years to come but am also mindful of the continuing difficult global market for base metals, particularly zinc. Against this  background it is understandable that this companys parent company is keeping its operations under ongoing review.

The EIS submitted by the port company has been examined to determine whether it meets statutory requirements and provides sufficient information to allow a decision to be made on the application. My Department has sought a meeting with the port company to discuss this matter and other issues relevant to the application. Decisions on the further action to be taken in respect of the application will be made in the light of those discussions. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to express any views on the port companys application at this stage.

I am optimistic, however, that situation will be quickly overcome once the current political impasse is resolved.The electricity systems between North and South are linked by interconnectors at three points: between Tandragee and Louth, Strabane and Letterkenny and Enniskillen and Corraclassy. Following the upgrading that took place during 2001, the main north-south interconnector, between Tandragee and Louth, now has a capacity to trade 2 x 600 megawatts of power, enough electricity to power several major towns – previously it had half that capacity. The other two interconnectors were commissioned in 1994 as standby links, primarily to allow the two grid companies to provide mutual assistance in an emergency. Since 2001, they have also been upgraded to full system interconnectors with a capacity of 120 megawatts each.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	701	In 2001 the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources commissioned SRK Consulting to undertake an integrated study of the entire Silvermines area, including the Gortmore tailings management facility, and to develop rehabilitation and management options for lands damaged by mining. The study cost €420,000, and the final report was published at a public meeting in Silvermines on 2 May 2002. The former mining company which mined State-owned minerals at Silvermines was presented with a copy of the report that day.Officials of my Department had met with the former company in January, April and May of 2002 in the run up to the publication of the report. My Department also has had meetings with the local community and elected representatives, the most recent being on 18 March 2003 in Silvermines.Under Clause K of the State mining lease held by the mining company, it has a contractual liability to rectify the lands affected by its working of State minerals. The State mining lease was valid for 33 years, expiring in December 1998, though production at the mine actually ceased in 1982. My Department has to specify what remedial works it requires the company to undertake. As part of its study, SRK was asked to examine what works would fall under the companys Clause K responsibilities and to integrate these into the overall recommended remediation programme.The Department's legal advice is that it can make only one demand on the company to carry out specified remediation works. The Department has been working in consultation with the Chief State Solicitors Office and using the SRK report to draft a notice to the company of the remedial works the company is required to carry out under the terms of Clause K. That document was recently finalised and was served on the company on 10 April 2003 by the Chief State Solicitors office. The Department will await the companys response before considering the matter further in consultation with the Chief State Solicitors office.However, the companys Clause K obligations cover only some of the former mining sites that require rehabilitation and long-term management. Silvermines has a long history of mining, spanning more than a thousand years. The SRK report deals with all mining sites at Silvermines. Fully implementing SRKs proposed rehabilitation and management programme will cost an estimated €5.2 million in capital costs towards rectifying former mining sites and €70,000 per year for long-term monitoring and maintenance of those sites.

In that regard I would refer the Deputy to the programme for Government, agreed in June 2002, which states that the Government "will approach the issue of the appropriate form of ownership or structure for state companies on a case-by-case basis" and "will support the maximum commercial freedom of semi-state companies, subject to the fulfilment of national strategic and balanced regional policy objectives". I have recently received a response from the chairman of Bord na Móna in relation to the board's views of the company's future strategy plans. My Department and the Department of Finance are currently considering this response and will be reverting to the company in due course.

The support mechanism employed is the alternative energy requirement programme, AER. Under this programme selected projects are offered guaranteed power purchase contracts with the ESB for 15 years. Since the programme was launched in 1995, a total of 150 megawatts of alternative and renewables based electricity generating capacity has been added to the grid including 100 megawatts of wind energy. A further 30 megawatts has been constructed more recently under the liberalised green electricity market regime.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The high level group on regulation was established in May 2001, following publication of the OECD Review on Regulatory Reform in Ireland, to develop and co-ordinate the better regulation agenda with particular regard to the institutional and policy proposals required on foot of the OECD's report. The group has met 16 times to date and reported to Government on its progress in November 2002. This progress report was published on the website, www.betterregulation.ie, in December 2002 and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. This report outlines progress made in relation to the OECD's recommendations on regulatory reform up to November 2002.Since the report was published, work has continued in my Department on the drafting of a national policy statement or White Paper on regulatory reform. To inform the formulation of the national policy statement, the 90 submissions received in response to the consultation document, Towards Better Regulation, were studied and analysed.My Department published in December 2002 a booklet containing two papers: the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an independent economist. Over 1,000 copies of the booklet have been sent out to interested parties and copies have, of course, been placed in the Oireachtas Library.A drafting group composed of senior officials from key Government Departments was formed in January 2003 to commence preparation of a draft national policy statement or White Paper on regulation. While a specific date for publication has not been set, it is anticipated that the draft text of the national policy statement will be submitted to the Government in early summer with a view to publication some weeks later.

The Deputy will understand that I cannot give details of payments made to individual companies in 2002 as such information is still commercially sensitive. However, details will be published in the Enterprise Ireland 2002 annual report not later than 30 June next as by then the information will be historical.

The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report. This committee meets on a monthly basis; publication of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe. This report was published last October. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented, some by the insurance industry and some by the relevant Government Departments. Progress on the other recommendations is continuing; publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB. This report was published last October; establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis. The chairperson and ordinary members of the interim PIAB board were appointed on 27 November 2002. Agreement on the initial drafting of legislation to put PIAB on a statutory basis has been reached and the general scheme of the Bill for the establishment of the PIAB on a statutory basis is intended to be published around the summer of 2003, after Government has given approval for drafting.

Within this programme all Departments and  offices have responsibility for actions in their specific functional areas.A high level group on regulation under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, comprising Government Departments and agencies, key regulatory authorities, the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, oversees implementation of the response to the OECD report and advises the Government. A progress report by the high level group on regulation was published on www.betteregulation.ie in December 2002 and was also placed in the Oireachtas Library. This report outlines progress made in relation to the OECD recommendations on regulatory reform.

Plans are in place to progress the remaining recommendations at an early stage.Some of the recommendations require the dedication of significant resources from the various stakeholders, for example, the preparation of legislation and the development of a book of quantum.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	714	In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The target average participation rate on the programme for 2003, which would include supervisors and participants, is 22,000. The number of supervisors required to work on CE is reducing in line with reductions in the number of participants on the programme. There were a total of 24,991 persons employed on CE at the start of 2003 and this number will reduce to a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000.The CE programme is currently under review. A cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future direction of the CE programme.

The steering group, which I established to undertake a study of the reserve, reported to me in September 1999.The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.

While there are no plans in this year's building programme for further works of a permanent nature, the question of any additional facilities will be kept under review. It is not the intention to install a digital indoor range theatre at Castlebar Barracks as such facilities are already available at a Permanent Defence Force location in the western brigade. These facilities are available for use by the reserve.
Question No. 120 answered with Question No. 116.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The defence sector has traditionally been highly regulated with most military matters governed by Defence Force regulations made by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Act. While this has had little or no adverse impact on business or the community, it has long been recognised in my Department that simplification and reform was necessary to keep pace with the ongoing modernisation of the sector and with best contemporary administrative practices.

Nineteen acres of the property are currently in the process of being sold and the remainder is used for military exercises. It is not intended to dispose of any further portions of the property at this time.Fort Camden is being disposed of to Cork County Council. The fort, plus 33.8 acres, have been held by the council under a caretaker's arrangement since 1989 and agreement has also been reached for the sale of the balance of the fort lands – approximately seven acres – to that local authority.

In this regard I have decided that part of the Camp Field, Collins Barracks, Cork will be disposed of and arrangements have been put in train to dispose of that area which comprises approximately 9.1 acres and which is made up of officers married quarters, tennis courts and the pitch and putt course. An offer from Cork City Council is currently under consideration in my Department.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	723	It is a condition of the EU regulation governing the scheme that the early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension paid to the retiring farmer. In the case of a joint management application, that is where the applicant does not own land or uses another person's land to maximise the pension, the amount of any national retirement pension payable to his or her spouse or partner must also be deducted.A joint management application is usually made where one spouse or partner is younger than the other. In the case of the person named, the application was made in his wife's name and they benefited very substantially as a result. He reached the age of 70, the maximum age for payment of early retirement pension, on 8 April 1998. Consequently, if a sole application had been made in his name the pension would have terminated on that date whereas because it was a joint management application, the pension could be paid for a considerably longer period and it continues to be paid. However, his wife became entitled to a national old age pension on 13 December 2002 and this had to be deducted from the early retirement pension. It was necessary for my Department to suspend payment of pension in January 2003 until confirmation was received that she had been awarded the old age pension. Confirmation has now been received, and payment is being restored at the reduced rate, including all arrears due, at the end of this month.

However, I am aware of the particular problem and the local district veterinary office is currently attempting to resolve the matter in conjunction with the local Defence Forces.However, the situation is compounded because the particular holding in question is land-locked and access to the holding is difficult. A successful resolution of the problem, therefore, will require the co-operation and assistance of local farmers. The legal division of my Department is currently writing to the seven neighbouring landowners requesting access to this holding on animal health and public safety grounds.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The OECD Report on Regulatory Reform in Ireland, published in 2001, did not focus specifically on the agriculture sector.

An application was submitted by the person named in relation to this quota. However, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied, an allocation was not made.An appeals procedure exists in relation to this scheme whereby applicants who did not qualify under the conditions of the scheme or who feel that the allocation made in their particular case was incorrect could appeal the decision to the milk quota appeals tribunal. The closing date for receipt of such appeals was 10 January 2003. There is no record of the person named having submitted an appeal before the closing date.

The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.The named person submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship. However, the amount of quota available for allocation at any given time is limited in the context of the large number of applications submitted. There was insufficient quota available in the 2002-03 milk quota year to enable the tribunal to recommend any further allocations and, unfortunately, it was not possible to make an allocation to the named person. A letter issued to him outlining the above position. However, his application will be further considered in the context of the hardship scheme for the 2003-04 milk quota year.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The EU regulation governing the early retirement scheme requires that the pension be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, receives. The Department has an obligation, therefore, to ensure that a participant does not receive full payment of early retirement pension if he or she is also entitled to a national retirement pension.On 2 October 2002 my Department informed the person named that he must apply for both the old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and provide documentary evidence of the outcome of his applications. However, he had still not provided this information by the time he reached the age of 66 on 19 January 2003, and my Department was forced to suspend the payment of his early retirement pension. On 28 January 2003, my Department learned from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that the person named was not entitled to the normal old age contributory pension but that his eligibility for an old age non-contributory pension was now being examined. As soon as the Department of Social and Family Affairs confirms the position to my Department in relation to this application, the question of his further entitlement to early retirement pension will be re-examined.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The strategic review of the dairy processing sector was jointly commissioned by my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry itself. The study focused on the existing structure of the dairy processing industry, the market opportunities for dairy products and the product options to exploit these opportunities. The report was presented on 19 March and has been broadly welcomed by the industry. It makes  a number of recommendations on actions to improve the efficiency and long-term competitiveness of the industry. One of the key strategies identified by the consultants is the need to increase the scale and cost efficiency at both producer and processing level.The need to increase scale and cost efficiency is not a new issue within the dairy industry and a number of reports have indicated the need for consolidation. The history of the sector in Ireland shows a considerable degree of consolidation, both at production and processing level. Furthermore, there has been considerable movement in this direction in competitor countries in recent years and the Irish industry must respond to ensure that it remains competitive on international markets. The increased size of dairy holdings in Ireland indicates that producers themselves recognise the importance of greater scale and efficiency. In this regard, I will continue to encourage committed active producers to grow and develop their enterprises to an optimal level. The decision on whether to remain in the industry is one which individual producers must make based on their own circumstances and the prevailing conditions within the industry.

Negotiations on both the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, and on the new WTO round, are at an early stage and it would be premature to predict the outcome. I have indicated my position regarding these negotiations and have vigorously represented the views of Irish industry in all of the discussions which have taken place thus far. My objective now and as these negotiations progress will be to achieve the best possible outcome for Irish agriculture, including the dairy sector.

A further payment of €645.58 issued to him on 9 April 2003 in respect of an additional area of 9.90 hectares.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	734	CPSU members in my Department's local offices have engaged in industrial action since 18 March 2003.Initially the action taken was a ban on telephone/fax queries and since 25 March this escalated to include the non-performance of counter duties in the afternoons. The CPSU had divided the country into four regions and the industrial action was to rotate between the regions on a weekly basis. As the action taken constituted a refusal to perform their core duties, my Department had no option but to remove staff from the payroll in the region undertaking the action.To date, 224 CPSU members have been removed from the payroll. The decision to remove staff from the payroll was not taken lightly. The union members had decided not to perform normal duties arising from telephone calls and faxes and duties at reception desks. The services provided from our local offices are essential to the farming community, in particular in the context of cattle movements to factories and marts as well as the various direct payments to farmers.

To date, good progress has been made in committing funds to projects and the Minister does not envisage any loss of funds from a failure to allocate to  projects. However, it is important that projects use the funds allocated to them to avoid any potential loss arising from the application of the Structural Fund regulations. While expenditure targets may be difficult to achieve, expenditure patterns are closely monitored and the programme managed in such a manner as to ensure no, or minimal, loss of funds.

The fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme is that a person should meet the specified medical criteria and should be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that  effect issued by the senior area medical officer who is an official of the local health board. Having secured the necessary medical certificate, the case can then be considered by the Revenue Commissioners.The Disabled Drivers' Association of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association administer the special facilities for parking for motorists with disabilities. The latter is subject to different medical criteria and I am advised that possession of a parking card for persons with a disability does not, in itself, mean that the persons concerned would meet the medical criteria for the issue of a primary medical certificate.I suggest that the persons concerned should contact their local senior area medical officer with a view to applying for the required certificates. If a certificate is obtained, application can then be made to the Central Repayments Office, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, telephone (047) 82800.I have arranged for a detailed information booklet, VRT 7, to be issued directly to the persons concerned.

My Department is represented on the high level group. The report outlines progress made in relation to the OECD's recommendations on regulatory reform. Since the report, my Department continues to contribute to the ongoing work being undertaken in the Department of the Taoiseach on the drafting of a national policy statement White Paper on Regulatory Reform and on the development of a model of regulatory impact analysis. I understand the White Paper will be published later this year.The Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, in my Department is keeping under review the content of its training courses for civil servants with a view to reflecting in them, as appropriate, emerging training needs arising from better regulation and regulatory impact analysis.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The position is that legally enforceable maintenance payments for the benefit of a child following separation, annulment or dissolution of a marriage do not qualify for tax relief for the person making them and likewise they are not regarded for income tax purposes as the income of the other parent or of the child.Voluntary maintenance payments, that is, payments which are not made under a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, for the benefit of a child are similarly ignored for tax purposes. The parent who makes the payment does not receive a tax deduction in respect of the payment and the payment is not treated as taxable income in the hands of the other parent or the child. This treatment applies regardless of whether the couple were married.The maintenance payments are made by the parent out of after tax income. Because the income has already been taxed, the subsequent payments for the benefit of the child are not taxable. This is in line with the tax treatment of other non-separated parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.I would point out to the Deputy also that, subject to certain conditions, where a parent, whether formerly married or not, has the care of a dependant child, i.e. the child is resident with the parent for the whole or part of the tax year, he or she is entitled, in addition to the basic personal credit of €1,520, to a one-parent family tax credit of €1,520. The combined value of these credits is equal to the married persons tax credit of €3,040.I am satisfied generally with the current arrangements regarding the taxation of child maintenance payments.

As I have previously said on many occasions, there is a wide range of important issues that must be taken into consideration and it is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have  responsibility. Given these wide-ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.

However, the holding of such a confined competition is being kept under review and the possibility remains that such a competition may be held in future if the need arises.The Deputy may wish to note that an open recruitment competition for appointment to the position of clerical officer in certain provincial locations has been advertised recently.

A hydrological study prepared in relation to the scheme found that the increase in water levels would be minimal.However, in order to address the concerns expressed Office of Public Works has agreed with Galway County Council to carry out a programme of maintenance works on the Dunkellin river, on behalf of the county council, from its confluence with the Aggard stream downstream towards Kilcolgan. I am satisfied that these maintenance works will greatly improve the flow regime in the Dunkellin and the question of increased flooding will not arise.

I also explained that the Government had accepted the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and had established a working group, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to advise on implementation. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations are to be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from this group. The report of the group is currently being drawn up and it is expected that it will be put before Government by the middle of the year. Pending receipt of this report, I am not in a position to give a more definitive response to the Deputy at this time.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	746	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 to 155, inclusive, together.There is a statutory obligation on taxpayers to make correct returns of their tax liabilities and pay the correct taxes due for all years of assessment. Where it becomes known to the Revenue Commissioners that tax has been underpaid it is their responsibility to recover the unpaid taxes together with interest and penalties.In the case of bogus non-resident account holders, Revenue provided an opportunity to those who had underpaid their taxes to make voluntary disclosures of the undeclared income, together with payment of the resulting tax liability and an amount of interest and penalties, capped at 100% of the tax liabilities, before 15 November 2001. This voluntary disclosure scheme, with its favourable settlement arrangements, was widely publicised, as was Revenue's clear intention to vigorously pursue those who did not avail of it.As many as 3,675 account holders chose to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme and paid €227 million in total. Revenue is now investigating individuals who did not avail of the scheme. Their details are being extracted from the lists of bogus non-resident account holders being supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the financial institutions under High Court orders. To date Revenue has issued letters on 11 October 2002 and 20 January 2003 concerning 35,000 non-resident accounts. There was a very high response rate to the inquiry letters both from individuals who have a liability and from others whose circumstances indicate that there is little or no liability. At present it is not possible to supply the detailed information requested because of the large volumes of responses received and which are still being processed. Revenue has informed me that €161 million has been paid by approximately 4,200 taxpayers. This is in addition to the €227 million which was paid before the 15 November 2001 deadline by 3,675 taxpayers. The numbers and amounts of these payments are likely to increase in the future. It is not possible to estimate what additional numbers and values of settlements will be made with Revenue in the future.It is a matter of regret that this issue may now be a cause of distress and anxiety to some of the individuals concerned. However, Revenue must continue to pursue the outstanding taxes. Revenue encourages anyone contacted by it or who anticipates such a contact to get in touch with their local inspector of taxes so that the particular facts of their position can be established as quickly as possible.

This allowed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to recommend to the Minister for Finance that certain areas be designated for the purposes of rented residential relief in relation to construction, conversion or refurbishment expenditure. The areas in question are certain areas where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has already recommended to the Minister for Finance that they be designated for residential owner-occupier relief.Section 25 also provided that where such a recommendation is made then the expenditure involved may be treated by the relevant local authority as consistent with the objectives of the integrated area plan or the town renewal plan concerned, even though the plan may not have contained or been accompanied by a recommendation from the local authority that designation for the appropriate rented residential relief should apply. The section applies as respects expenditure incurred on or in relation to a qualifying residential property on or after 5 December 2001 generally and in certain cases for expenditure prior to that date, subject to conditions.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	749	In July 2002, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt launched a new Ireland Aid-Department of Finance strategy on the issue of developing country debt. This comprehensive strategy set out in detail the Government's approach to the problem and updated the principles on debt relief announced by the Government in 1998.The debt relief strategy indicated, inter alia, that the Government believes total debt cancellation to be a politically acceptable objective and one that it would support. However, the strategy also emphasised that the funding of debt cancellation would have to come from additional overseas development assistance from donors.The strategy raised a number of concerns about the operation of the World Bank-IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries'. HIPC, initiative, such as the adequacy of the levels of debt relief being provided and the assumptions used in the calculations of sustainable debt levels. The Government is particularly concerned that the HIPC process does not take into account the impact of HIV-AIDS on the economies of the HIPC countries.Since the launch of the debt strategy, we have promoted this strategy very vigorously in our contacts with the World Bank and at other appropriate international fora. Minister of State, Deputy Kitt has highlighted the salient features of the strategy, in particular debt cancellation, in a variety of contacts he has had in Dublin and Washington with the World Bank at presidential, vice presidential and very senior level and he will continue to do so.In September of last year, the Taoiseach reiterated the Government's commitment in principle to debt cancellation in his address to the World Summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg.In Washington last November, Deputy Kitt discussed a range of development issues, including debt, with senior officials and the Canadian leader of our constituency at the World Bank. During his meeting with the Bank's Vice President, Mr Jean Francois Rischard, in December 2002, he again laid particular emphasis on our debt strategy and debt cancellation. In January 2003, Deputy Kitt visited Ethiopia for discussions with the Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, which included debt relief.In January last, the President of the World Bank, Mr. James Wolfensohn, visited Dublin and had meetings with the Taoiseach and Deputy Kitt. The visit was utilised to promote our debt strategy and our concerns about the effectiveness of the HIPC initiative in reducing debt to sustainable levels.

In this regard, I understand that a progress report by the high level group on regulation, which is chaired by that Department, was published on www.betterregulation.ie in December 2002; it is also available on request from the Department of the Taoiseach. This report outlines progress made in Ireland in relation to the OECD's recommendations on regulatory reform. Since then, work has continued on the drafting of a national policy statement-White Paper on Regulatory Reform, which is expected to be published later this year.

In this regard, and despite what all of us may wish, the reality is that at present there seems little likelihood of any special measures being introduced to regularise the position of undocumented Irish people in the US.Our embassy and consulates maintain a close working relationship with the Irish immigration groups in the United States. Through this channel and through their broader contacts with the Irish community, the embassy and the consulate monitor the situation with regard to the undocumented Irish in the United States.An annual sum, $300,000 in 2002, has been provided in the Vote for Foreign Affairs to assist groups in the US working with the Irish immigrants there. One very welcome development is the close co-ordination and co-operation between immigrant advice groups funded by the Government, largely as a result of the formation of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres in 1995.The diversity programme, DV, or Schumer visa lottery was introduced in 1994, and remains an important avenue of legal emigration from Ireland to the US.

Current indications are that ODA in 2003 will reach €450 million, our highest ever level of spending on development co-operation. This will approximate to 0.41% of GNI in 2003. Maintaining our contribution as a proportion of GNI in these difficult times is a measure of the Government's clear commitment to the aid programme and to achieving the UN target of 0.7% by 2007.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.I am aware of this correspondence which requested that Ireland put a resolution on nuclear weapons to the Security Council prior to its departure from the Council at the end of 2002. A senior official from the Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York had several telephone conversations with Ms Lavery in connection with the matter raised in the correspondence under reference.The UN Charter, however, vests in the General Assembly the prime responsibility for consideration of the "general principles of co-operation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments".Much of the practical work of devising general principles takes place in the UN Disarmament and International Security Committee, commonly known as the First Committee, of which Ireland is a member. The First Committee meets during the UN General Assembly session to deal with the disarmament issues on the agenda of that session, and its consultations shape the tone of the disarmament debate.Ireland is an active participant in the First Committee and uses all useful opportunities to ensure that the pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation stays at the fore of the Committee's deliberations and output.With regard to nuclear weapons, Ireland is of course a founding member of the New Agenda Coalition which has been highly instrumental in achieving a detailed and agreed outcome to the 2000 Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The outcome there provides a blueprint for a step by step approach to negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear arsenals.

The programme shows that €18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant. The programme also identifies explicitly that there are two parts to the grant, €12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of €3,809 to each school and €5.6 million for payment of the per capita element at €12.70 per pupil.The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools, would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible. The published programme unambiguously states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as in previous years.Arrangements for this review are being finalised at the moment. It is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year.

Seven facilities that use an applied behavioural analysis approach to education are operating on a pilot project basis. A significant amount of the above provision is in the greater Dublin area. Details will be available on my Department's website, www.education.ie, shortly. The national educational psychological service, NEPS, provides an educational psychology service to schools in the State, including those in Dublin 9 and 15. NEPS may be contacted at Frederick Court, 24-27 North Frederick Street, Dublin 1.In addition to providing for the ongoing development of special educational needs services, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for a more efficient and effective system for service delivery to special needs children. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the national council for special education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. A consultative forum will be established by the council to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive has been appointed to the council and it is intended that the body will be vested shortly.

Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, it is not envisaged that my Department will be in a position during this year to appoint a design team to commence architectural planning for the project at St. Michael's. The project will, however, be given every consideration for the 2004 school building programme.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	797	Persistent non-attendance at school is a key indicator for subsequent difficulties, including early school leaving, long-term unemployment, homelessness, substance abuse and criminal activity. Tackling this problem is, therefore, a key priority for the Government and the approach I have been taking involves a series of  actions, both statutory and non-statutory. I regard the statutory and non-statutory actions as complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The latter would include those actions being taken under the school completion programme and other initiatives to encourage better school attendance patterns by pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which is now fully commenced, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national agency with responsibility for school attendance. The principal function of the new board is to ensure that every child in the State attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an appropriate minimum education. The board appointed an interim chief executive officer in August 2002 and directors of corporate services and educational services have recently taken up their posts. The board is currently recruiting eight further head office staff.Thirty seven former school attendance officers who were employed by local authorities under the previous legislation were transferred to the board on 5 July 2002 in accordance with section 40 of the Act. These 37 staff are currently providing a service in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Waterford and 25 of them have recently accepted the terms and conditions of employment of educational welfare officer, EWO, and will henceforth be carrying out the full range of EWO duties and providing a year round service rather than the school term-based service they were providing as former school attendance officers.Proposals for the recruitment of an additional cohort of educational welfare officers have been received from the board and officials of my Department had discussions with the executive of the board recently in relation to these proposals. Arising from these discussions, the executive wrote to my Department on 4 April clarifying certain costs associated with the proposals. It is not possible to specify the number of new education welfare officers who will be put in place this year until my Department has had an opportunity to consider these proposals and costs in a multi-annual framework.I have allocated a budget of €5.4 million to the board for the current year and it is my intention that the board's proposals will be taken forward in the context of these resources and the budgetary allocations in future years. The board's proposals provide for the assignment of staff on a regional basis, with regional managers being put in place to ensure smooth implementation of the Act nationally.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	798	My Department does not define catchment areas for primary schools. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school.Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.

The project at Ballybay will, however, be considered for the 2004 school building programme.

Youthreach targets unemployed early school leavers with no qualifications or poor qualifications in the 15-20 years age range. This group is known as priority group 1 or PG1.Youthreach recruitment guidelines circulated to vocational education committees are as follows: a PG1 trainee will be in the age group 15-20 years and have left school, be unemployed, be aged between 15 and 20 years of age at the commencement of her-his engagement with youthreach, have no qualifications or have incomplete qualifications from junior cycle, that is, less than five grade Ds at ordinary level in the junior certificate or otherwise lack competencies or skills in the area of interpersonal communications, enterprise or motivation. Youthreach age and qualification criteria may be extended in the case of the following groups – priority group 2 or PG2: lone parents; referrals from former NRB funded courses now funded by FÁS; trainees who have been released from detention; trainees whose personal or domestic circumstances are such that a foundation education and training programme is the most appropriate option for them to pursue, qualifications notwithstanding; Travellers; Drug Court participants.At present the courses are full-time, of 35 hours duration per week, and are available on a year round basis. A training allowance is payable to participants at different rates, depending on age. The rate of training allowance for trainees aged 18 years and over is linked to the maximum unemployment payment under the Department of Social and Family Affairs for an adult. An additional training bonus of €31.80 per week may be payable in certain circumstances. The programme operates in community training workshops funded by FÁS and in youthreach centres.A similar programme in a culturally supportive environment is operated for Travellers in a network of senior Traveller training centres. There is no upper age limit in the senior Traveller centres in order to encourage parents to participate, given the influence this exerts on their children's participation in school.

The Act provides a comprehensive new framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. All sections of the Act are now commenced.The Act provides for the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for encouraging and supporting regular school attendance. The board has responsibility for ensuring that every child aged six to 16 years attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an appropriate minimum education. The board is required to advise and assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in ensuring that their children attend school regularly and must also assist schools in meeting their obligations under the Act.Where a child is not attending school or is not otherwise in receipt of an appropriate education, the board will investigate the case and establish reasons for non-attendance. It will then work collaboratively with the family, the school and others concerned with the child's welfare with a view to resolving the situation. The board also has the legal power to compel a parent to send his-her child to school. However, this power will only be used where all other measures have failed and where the board is of the view that the parent has not made all reasonable efforts in this regard.The board also has responsibilities in relation to children who are educated outside of a recognised school and children aged 16 and 17 years who leave school to take up employment. The position in relation to out of school schemes such as youthreach, which are open to 15 year olds as mentioned by the Deputy, is being considered jointly by my Department and the NEWB at present. To discharge its responsibilities, the board will develop a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others who are concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers or EWOs will be appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.

The setting up of such units and the placing of a student within a support unit must only be considered when there is no other option available to the school. Strict guidelines are set down by the Department in respect of the establishment of these units.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	806	As the Deputy may be aware, Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of the designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual ‘at risk' pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.It is regrettable that the school to which the Deputy refers will lose a teaching post at the end of this school year and receive reduced funding due to the misinterpretation of the questionnaire and the miscalculation of points in relation to the school. However, following this correction and having regard to the funding available to this scheme, another school may fall into the category of schools considered for additional teaching staff, thereby ensuring that resources are targeted towards the most marginalised children in areas of greatest need.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	817	I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 269 together.Since the publication of the National Competitiveness Council report there have been a number of significant developments which should lead to a greater take up of the Internet and broadband services and improve Ireland's international ranking. A number of communications companies offering DSL services have recently announced major reductions in the prices of their broadband services bringing the cost of DSL in line with the European norm.In accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulation Act, 2002, on 21 February last I issued a set of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation focusing on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat-rate Internet access call origination, known as FRIACO. This will be introduced before the end of June 2003.The provision, promotion and pricing of communications infrastructure and services, including Internet access, is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years.Under the national development plan 2000-2006, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services.

While the group met on two occasions to consider preliminary issues, it was not possible, given other commitments and priorities, to progress the study.It is not proposed to proceed with this study at present. The position will, however, be kept under review in the context of my Department's overall work relating to the development of more integrated approaches to the management of coastal areas.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	822	I am advised that the latest and most accurate scientific information available indicates that in 2002 179,177  wild salmon were caught by drift nets, which represents 31% of the estimated total returning population before any exploitation.My predecessor firmly ruled out buy-out as an effective means of achieving the shared objective of restoration of salmon stocks and instead promoted the policy of quotas to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.The issues inherent in a complete voluntary buy-out of the Irish commercial salmon sector are very complex. The international experience is also mixed. We need to caution against excessive raising of expectation about large amounts of compensation. Nor is it the case that all active commercial salmon fishermen are willing to be bought out. Simplistic solutions will not work.The Central Fisheries Board is currently examining a number of options, including possible models for a buy-out-set-aside scheme, aimed at reducing the level of commercial exploitation of the salmon resource. The board will be informed in this regard by an independent report that it has commissioned, and expects to be finalised shortly, on the socio-economic value of the salmon resource. Pending the outcome of these reports, I remain to be convinced about buyouts as a cost efficient workable instrument.

It is my intention that in the future these duties will be adjusted annually in line with the consumer price index.According to the fisheries boards, the increases are in line with inflation, rounded up or down to the nearest €5, with the exception of the one-day ordinary licence, which has been increased from €3.80 to €10. The boards sought the greater than inflation rate increase in this case because an increase in line with inflation, to €5.61, would still not cover the cost of printing and distributing the licences. It was decided that the juvenile licence would remain at the 1992 price of €10 per annum. It is most important that young people are encouraged to take up angling for the future of recreational angling and to foster an awareness of our fisheries environment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	824	Sea bass is not subject to a total allowable catch, TAC, or quota. However, at the December 2002 Fisheries Council member states, the Commission and the Council issued a statement stating that member states would limit their fishing effort on directed fisheries for sea bass in community waters of the Atlantic to the levels of recent years.At national level, the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order, in place since 1990, prohibits the commercial fishing of sea bass by Irish sea fishing boats. The domestic conservation measures for sea bass are kept under review on an annual basis, in light of scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute of the state of seabass stocks as well as assessments of the impact of commercial fishing effort on seabass stocks by other member states.Last year, having reviewed the scientific assessments relating to sea bass, I decided that the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Order should be renewed for a further year. The effect of this order is to prohibit the sale or offer for sale of bass (other than bass which has been imported into the State) from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. The bass fishing conservation by-law which imposes a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of 24 hours and provides for a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season was also renewed last year.These domestic conservation measures for sea bass will continue to be kept under review by the Department over the coming months, in light of scientific stock assessments.

Since I was appointed, I have had a number meetings and engagements  with mobile phone companies at which issues of interest were discussed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 259, 260, and 261 together.With regard to non-petroleum minerals, as the Deputy knows, exploration in this country is undertaken by holders of prospecting licences granted under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. New exploration is continuously undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of prospecting licences, of which there were 351 current at the end of January 2003. There were 391 licences current at the end of June 2002. My Department continues to be actively engaged in promoting investment interest in minerals exploration from overseas companies, in order to keep the level of exploration in the country as high as possible, given the depressed general global economic situation, and the base metals sector in particular.No new economic deposits have been discovered in recent years. There have been some encouraging results, however. Exploration adjacent to existing base metal mines at Navan, County Meath – Tara Mines Limited – and Galmoy, County Kilkenny – Arcon Mines Limited – has discovered additional resources which have the potential to extend the life of those mines, and applications for additional State mining facilities for these are at present being dealt with in my Department. My officials have also had discussions with Irish Gypsum Limited regarding that company's plans to develop an underground extension to its existing operation in County Monaghan. A good zinc prospect area near Pallasgreen, County Limerick also has the potential to host an economic deposit and exploration is continuing.

On the basis of the most recent advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside safe biological limits. In so far as the areas and species most affected are concerned, there is particular concern about a number of key whitefish stocks throughout community waters, in particular cod and hake.Stock recovery measures have been introduced for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod in the North Sea and west of Scotland. The Commission is in the process of preparing long-term recovery plans for these and other stocks and specific proposals in this regard are expected later this year. The intention is to have such plans in place from the beginning of next year.Ireland has been at the forefront at EU level in pushing for enhanced conservation measures to protect fish stocks. I will continue to push for further systematic action in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The biggest challenge facing the fishing industry at the present time is in relation to the pressure which many of the key whitefish species are under. The industry accepts that measures must be put in place for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of these stocks. The debate at EU level centres around the appropriate mechanisms for achieving this objective.The Commission advocates a policy of large-scale restrictions on days at sea leading to decommissioning of fishing vessels. This approach is disproportionate and not the best method to achieve a sustainable exploitation approach to fish stocks. The socio-economic effects of such simplistic policies cannot be ignored and I have consistently stressed to my EU Council colleagues and to Commissioner Fischler the unacceptable socio-economic effects that such policies would have on Irish fishermen and their families.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	830	As I indicated in reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 4 March 2003, the Government has identified a number of key priorities for the development of the fishing industry in particular and the seafood industry generally.These developmental priorities relate to how the Common Fisheries Policy should operate in accordance with the key principles of sustainable development, better governance, more stakeholder involvement and an increased emphasis on conservation and stock building. I look forward to substantial progress on these fronts in the years ahead.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I refer the Deputy to a number of publications that give an overview on world-wide developments in the area of broadband and wireless technologies: OECD: The Development of Broadband Access in OECD Countries 29 October 2001; OECD: Broadband Infrastructure Deployment: the role  of Government Assistance 22 May 2002; International Telecommunications Union: Promoting Broadband background paper April 2003; ComReg: Future Delivery of Broadband in Ireland – ref 02/79.The application and provision of new communications and broadband technologies in Ireland is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in a fully liberalised telecommunications market and the companies operating here continually introduce new technologies to the Irish market as appropriate.The State provides assistance, where appropriate, to accelerate the deployment of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services.The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of "always on", low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business.It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million. Construction of networks has begun in Cork, Galway and Mayo and further projects will commence once contracts have been completed.My Department is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way. WLAN is a technology that was originally developed for in-house use, such as office local area networks but is increasingly seen as an alternative technology in the delivery of broadband services. Five projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.

The operators are developing their current networks for handling data services.Concerning future networks the Commission for Communications Regulation, following a competition has issued three licences for the next generation of mobile networks called third generation or 3G.The development of third generation networks worldwide has not been as fast as previously envisaged and worldwide are only being launched now. It is expected that third generation mobile will be launched in Ireland during 2003.

In 2003, Government funding for the Arts Council amounts to €44.101 million.My Department grant aids directly the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall. The amount provided in sub-head D3 of my Department's Vote in 2003 for these institutions is €5.831 million. A provision of €8.436 million is provided under Vote 41 in respect of the National Gallery of Ireland.In addition, my Department directly provides capital grants for the provision of arts and cultural infrastructure around the country under, for example, the ACCESS scheme. A provision of €10 million approximately has been included in sub-head D5 of my Department's Vote in respect of anticipated expenditure under this scheme in 2003.My Department does not have details of arts expenditure by local authorities.

This report outlines progress made in relation to the OECD's recommendations on regulatory reform. Since the report, work has continued in the Department of the Taoiseach on the drafting of a national policy statement/White Paper on regulatory reform and, I understand, it is expected to be published later this year. In the meantime, the high level group on regulation will continue to monitor and co-ordinate progress in this area.Given the nature of the work of my Department, regulatory reform developments do not have a significant impact. My officials, however, will continue to monitor relevant issues arising and input to the ongoing reform programme.

I advertised the 2003 programme in the national newspapers on March 23 and 24 with a deadline for receipt of applications of 5 p.m. on Friday, April 25 next. The duration of the application period is similar to that in 2002, when more than 1,350 applications were received. In addition, given that the programme has been so successful and has allocated more than €213 million to more than 2,900 projects in the past five years, it is well established as a vital source of sports funding and most prospective applicants would have been aware that the programme is run on an annual basis and would have much of the planning of the application already in place. Accordingly, I do not propose to accede to the request from the Deputy.Questions Nos. 274 and 275 withdrawn.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	838	My Department, together with the health boards, is currently supporting the implementation of a key recommendation of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase since the end of 1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	839	There are no plans to introduce legislation which would permit the deliberate destruction of human embryos. In relation to assisted human reproduction services generally, while there is no legislation regulating this area at present, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct.I am conscious of concerns about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area. With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: "to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."  When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. Given the complexity of the issues under examination, it is difficult to be definitive about when the work of the commission will be completed. I am, however, satisfied that it is working as expeditiously as is feasible.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	840	Sections 66 and 67 of the Health Act 1970 (No. 1 of 1970) provide that health boards shall make ophthalmic treatment and optical appliances available, free of charge, to children attending a  national school. Where a defect is identified as a result of an examination carried out in accordance with the legislation, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority continue to provide treatment and appliances until the child attains the age of 16 years. Responsibility for the provision of ophthalmic services in County Mayo rests with the Western Health Board. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.

The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of more than 120.In the eastern region there are two high support units. The six place Creag Arann high support unit is located in the South-Western Area Health Board and the 24 place Crannóg Nua high support unit located in the Northern Area Health Board opened late last year and is being brought on stream on a phased basis. Also in the eastern region is the Ballydowd special care unit in the South-Western Area Health Board which provides a national service to young people aged 11 to 17 years. It is anticipated that the Ballydowd service will incorporate a step down service with capacity for six young people in addition to the 18 places on site. I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that given the existing capacity, there is no current plan to develop further high support units.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	844	I have very much supported the concept of out-of-hours general practitioner co-operatives and am very pleased that they are now operating in all health board areas, for all, or limited hours, on weekdays, at weekends and on public and bank holidays. At present, only the North-Eastern Health board has a regional project. All of the other boards have started on a cell basis and have built or intend to build to cover the board's area on an incremental basis as interest and resources permit. The specific area to be designated as suitable for a co-operative is a matter for the relevant health board to decide and involves lengthy discussion and preparatory work with the stakeholders involved.As I explained on 8 April to the Deputy, funding is provided for co-operatives in their base line budgets and where additional funds for expansion are being sought by health boards, these must be sought at the time of the submission of their service plans to the Department. These allocations are normally made at the time of the Estimates and the letters of determination to boards specify the amount of money under the particular heading of co-operatives.

When this documentation is received it will be examined by the professional staff in my Department. My Department is undertaking a mid-term review of the national development plan for the health services.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	848	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 287 and 294 together.In the two years to the end of 2001, the number of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service increased by more than 30% or by 91 to 380. Information in respect of the employment position at the end of 2002 is being compiled by my Department and will be available shortly.Information on vacancies of health service personnel is not collected on a routine basis by my Department. Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of vacant psychologist posts in each health board region, rests with the chief executive officer of each board. Each chief executive officer, in managing the workforce in his or her region, is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling.My Department, together with the health boards, is currently supporting the implementation of a key recommendation of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase since the end of 1999, from 26 to 83, in the number of student clinical psychologists employed in the health services.My Department continues to work with health agencies and the education authorities to ensure adequate training places in clinical psychology consistent with the human resource requirements of the health services and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the Action Plan for People Management published in November 2002, in order to secure the best return on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in supporting postgraduate clinical psychology training.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	851	On 30 January 2003 at the launch of the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the workplace, I announced a prohibition on smoking in places of work which will come into operation on 1 January 2004. This prohibition will include shopping centres.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000 recommended the establishment of a joint management and union committee to deal with issues arising from the recognition of the autonomy of the child care worker profession, including the setting up of a proper career structure for child care workers. The joint committee on social care professionals was established on that basis and arising from the work of the joint committee, the grade of assistant house parent was abolished in the child care sector and replaced by the grade of child care worker and the grade of house parent was abolished and replaced by the grade of child care leader.Significant salary increases were agreed for child care grades in the context of the restructuring process, with effect from 1 January 2001. As part of the introduction of formal professional status for child care grades, entrants to the profession are required to hold a recognised qualification. At the time of the restructuring arrangements, there were a number of assistant house parents who held recognised qualifications and, as a once-off measure, it was agreed that these staff would transfer to the child care leader scale. This "red circling" arrangement applied to assistant house parents who were in permanent employment on 31 December, 2000, a date consistent with the effective date of the new salary scales. The arrangement was designed to boost staff retention in the child care sector, an area serving a particularly vulnerable client group, where workforce stability is especially important due to the potential duration of the relationship between staff members and clients.The "red circling" arrangement did not apply to assistant house parents without recognised qualifications. However, existing assistant house parents without recognised qualifications benefited from the pay increase awarded to their grade, an increase of more than 26% at the top of the assistant house parent-child care worker scales. The first line promotional outlet for child care workers is the child care leader grade which remains open to appropriately qualified child care workers in the normal way.

Figures for comparison between EU countries are compiled by the OECD. Figures comparing GNP are not available, however, the most recent data available from the OECD for public expenditure on health as a percentage of gross domestic product are from the year 2000. At that time the EU average, excluding Luxembourg and Sweden, was 5.9%, with Ireland at 5.1%. The OECD will publish data for 2001 during the summer. Given the significant additional spending on health services in 2001 and 2002, it is expected that Ireland will have made considerable progress towards the EU average by the end of 2002.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	858	The Estimate for the Department of Health and Children in 2003 is more than €9,158 million. Included in this total is capital funding of €514 million and non-capital funding of €8,644 million. Non-capital funding is further broken down into non-pay funding of €2,620 million and a pay element of €6,024 million. Salary costs are an integral part of all services, including front line services. Based on an analysis undertaken by my Department, some 83% of all staff are employed in front line activities. Assuming pay grades are equally dispersed between staff in front line and non-front line services, the pay component in the provision of front line services is in the region of €5 billion.

Considerable preparatory work has already been completed, including the provision of appropriate assessment facilities required to support the development of the service and the appointment of key transplant personnel at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, which has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. Revenue funding of €7.9 million has been provided in the current year to support the commencement of the programme.My Department does not routinely collect data relating to the number of adults and children with cystic fibrosis who are currently waiting for transplant.

The home birth scheme was suspended by the Western Health Board on this basis. The current caseload of patients who have booked for home births will have their service completed and these commitments will be fulfilled. No new patients have been accepted on to the scheme since 6 March last. I am advised that the board's obstetric services will be further reviewed on the appointment of the consultant neonatologist within the framework of priority service objectives and national policy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	867	The main conclusion of the Forum on Fluoridation was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. It also reported that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the population and the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected.The forum made its conclusions after taking an evidence based approach to its examination of the issue. Its membership consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research.The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of subgroups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward their views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. In adopting a participatory and evidence based approach, the forum strove to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation.The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride. In particular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The position is that the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 1996 gives explicit powers to the VHI board in relation to entering into, or refusing to enter into, agreements with health service providers for the treatment and care of its members. Similarly, the regulatory framework covering health insurance business, the Health Insurance Acts and related regulations, provides for insurers to determine the service providers in respect of whom benefits are payable for the treatment and care of members under their plan.The VHI, therefore, is entitled to determine its process for selecting which nursing homes it will cover for the purpose of providing convalescent care for members and it would not be appropriate for my Department to intervene. Private health insurance does not cover long-term nursing care. The VHI provides cover towards the cost of convalescent home charges for up to 14 days, as required by the private health insurance regulatory framework, in approved convalescent homes listed in VHI's directory of convalescent homes.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The drugs payment scheme – DPS – replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes in 1999. It was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced following amendment of the relevant section of the Health Act 1970. However, amendment of the Act was delayed and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's Office in October 2000, regulations made under section 59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001.Given that, as has been pointed out previously, claimants derived greater overall benefits under the new scheme, as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at the time. Following a review by my Department of the position in relation to this issue, it has now been decided that a process should be put in place for assessing applications for refunds to people who may be owed money arising from the introduction of the DPS.

The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary north. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary south.Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population. Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and the south is costed at €27 million, including €13 million capital costs.In relation to funding requirements, I do not anticipate additional revenue requirements for this programme this year. Revenue requirements for subsequent years will be considered in the context of the Estimates process. As regards capital costs, discussions are ongoing involving officials of my Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies. Meetings took place the week before last in both Cork and Galway in relation to the detailed roll-out of this programme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	880	BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with its first phase covering the ERHA, the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 140,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. By end December 2002, 110,636 women  had been called for screening and 83,000 women had been screened. This represents an uptake of 75%.Women eligible for the programme are those between the ages of 50 and 64 at the time when BreastCheck is screening in their area. The organisation has informed my Department that it has taken longer than expected to complete the first round of screening due to a national shortage of radiographers during the start-up period. It is now working to full capacity in the eastern area with a full complement of radiographers and round one is in the final stages of completion.As BreastCheck did not reach all parts of the eastern area for a first round of screening by 2002, provision has been made so that women who have exceeded the age limit, during the period of the overrun, may contact the programme to avail of the service.BreastCheck is committed to returning to each area, for a second round of screening, within 27 months. The second round of screening in the eastern area began in September 2002. If the period of returning to any area is longer than 27 months, and women exceed the age limit during the period of the overrun, the organisation will still invite these women for a further mammogram. This will ensure that no woman who is eligible for screening is excluded from the programme.

My Department made it clear to all agencies involved in this exercise that, while making every effort to provide the resources required to address the needs identified in the review, it could not give a commitment in relation to a specific timeframe within which these needs would be met.As resources have become available to my Department specific funding has been provided annually over the past number of years to meet these needs in various agencies. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget.

They do not investigate road traffic accidents which are investigated in all cases by the police.In Luxembourg the accident investigation unit has been expanded to cover road accident investigation. To date, no such investigations have been carried out. In Norway plans are under way to incorporate road accident investigation into the multi-modal investigation unit.Here the primary immediate investigative role in relation to road accidents is vested in the Garda Síochána. Priority, in the pursuit of such an investigation, must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents and in particular to the determination of whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence.The Garda Síochána is the only body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person who the Garda considers should be accused of the commission of an offence. In the final instance it is a matter for the courts to decide on the guilt or innocence of an accused person. The Garda reports relating to an accident provide information to assist the courts in making decisions in such matters.

The capital budget approved by the Government for the project provides for the direct costs associated with the design and construction of the Luas and also provides for a significant landscaping programme for areas most affected by construction. I understand that Kingswood Heights will be a major beneficiary of this programme.I appreciate that businesses and residents along the route of the Luas will experience disruption during the construction phase. However, when services commence in 2004, the Luas will offer an attractive, modern, public transport system that, I hope, will far outweigh any inconveniences that are being suffered at the present time.

I understand from the company that the charge for parking at Limerick station has been in place for several years now. Iarnród Éireann has also informed me that the parking charge being imposed at Limerick station is the cheapest in the city. The charge provides funding for the upkeep and development of the parking area.

Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána and local authority traffic wardens.The regulations also provide for the exemption from that prohibition for the driver of a fire brigade vehicle or an ambulance or to the use by a member of the Garda Síochána of a vehicle in the performance of the duties of that member, where such use does not thereby endanger the safety of road users.The regulations do not provide for an exemption from this prohibition to people collecting children from schools or day care centres. In addition, the regulations provide for the application of a specific prohibition on the parking or stopping of a vehicle at a school entrance.

The work is being undertaken as part of the national safety investment programme under the national development plan.The work involves renewal of trackwork, the construction of new bridges and the upgrading of level crossings. The track renewal work was completed in 2002 apart from a small section in the immediate vicinity of Thomastown station, which will be completed this year. Resignalling of the line will be completed by 2004 as part of the mini-CTC programme. When the work has been completed, it is estimated that travel times will be reduced by up to ten minutes.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	905	The purchase and operation of individual types of rolling stock is an operational matter for Irish Rail.Irish Rail recently placed orders for 67 new locomotive-hauled carriages for use on intercity services. I understand that these are primarily intended for use on the Cork to Dublin line. In addition, Irish Rail is currently examining the scope to acquire high specification inter-regional railcars for use on mainline rail services. I am informed that both types of trains will be capable of reaching the maximum line speeds of whatever lines they are deployed on.

This is clearly an issue for consideration by local authorities along the Limerick Junction to Rosslare line, in the light of the conclusions reached by the consultants who undertook the strategic rail review.

The report includes an assessment of many rail proposals, which took account of submissions received as part of a public consultation process.

Section 37 of that Act provides for the sanction which may be imposed for failure to attend at an inquest when summoned as a witness.In the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review of the coroner's service, work is under way in my Department on the preparation of a new coroner's bill. I am also awaiting the imminent publication of the report of the coroner's rules committee. With specific reference to the Deputy's question, it is my intention that the new coroner's legislation would remove the restriction limiting to a maximum of two the number of medical witnesses a coroner may summon to give evidence.The current sanction contained in Section 37 which may be imposed on a witness who fails to attend at an inquest is £5, €6.35. I would intend to increase this sanction significantly. I would also intend to address the issue of sanctions on those witnesses who refuse to co-operate at an inquest.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	911	The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in relation to  employment on nine grounds including age. The Equal Status Act 2000 prohibits discrimination on the same nine grounds in relation to access to and provision of goods and services. The age provisions of the Employment Equality Act apply to persons between the ages of 18 and 65 or over the minimum school leaving age and under 65 in the case of vocational training. Under the Equal Status Act the age ground refers to a person over 18 years with no upper age threshold applying.The legislation provides a means of redress for anyone who considers that s/he has suffered unlawful discrimination. The Equality Authority has also been established to work towards the elimination of unlawful discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities.The Employment Equality Act 1998 will be strengthened on the implementation of Directive 2000/78/EC – Framework Employment Directive – which provides a general framework for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to employment and occupation on grounds of religion and belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.The directive must be implemented by 2 December 2003. However, in order to take account of particular conditions, member states may, if necessary, have an additional three years from December 2003 to December 2006 to implement the provisions of the directive on age and disability grounds.I am satisfied that the equality infrastructure put in place on the coming into force of the equality legislation is sufficiently resourced to respond to discrimination in our society whether in the workplace or elsewhere.The Equality Authority, in order to address discrimination arising from systems and institutional behaviour, commissioned a report entitled Implementing Equality for Older People. This report examines the issue of ageism and puts forward recommendations for change which are based on a number of key principles including the need to give due regard to difference for older people in their particular situation, experience and identity.A project team has been set up under the National Economic and Social Forum to assess implementation issues arising out of the recommendations of the report. I will be happy to examine the outcome of the project team's work on its completion.

While this is a small reduction in the amount made available to the games last year, it is nevertheless a significant contribution and was recognised as such at the recent meeting I had with the representatives. I have also discussed alternative funding arrangements with them which I am hopeful will leave the overall support given to the games on a comparable basis with last year.In making this subvention available, recognition has been given by me to the fact that the Community Games is a unique national organisation which provides a wonderful opportunity every year for children to participate in sports and pageantry on the same site as the State's largest accommodation centre for asylum seekers. As such and given its national reach in community involvement it is fully deserving of this continued Government support.

In this context, my Department has made appropriate inputs into the development of the public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation, and a model for regulatory impact analysis, RIA. Regarding the latter, my Department has identified the intended reform of gaming-lotteries legislation as a possible pilot project for RIA.As regards reform of the liquor licensing system, the Commission on Liquor Licensing has recently submitted its fourth and final report. The commission has recommended wide-ranging structural reforms of the licensing system and I intend to respond to these recommendations in a codification of the entire intoxicating liquor code which I have already announced. Reform of the code will require collaboration with other agencies such as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners the Courts Service and the Garda. My intention is that an outline of the reformed system will be completed by mid-2004.

The forum operates through a model which was agreed by community and Garda representatives following a protracted period of consultation. The forum is operated through three community level fora and one district level forum. The forum to which the Deputy refers is one of the community level fora.The original community policing forum did not provide for the provision of a co-ordinator. However, following an independent evaluation of the forum, the issue of the provision of a co-ordinator was raised. This matter is currently under consideration.

The effect of the judgment is that the power to mitigate penalties must be used sparingly and only in special and exceptional circumstances, with the proper maintenance of records. The court also noted that the petitions procedure is not an alternative system of justice to that provided by the courts.A new petition procedure was introduced in 1997 to take account of the High Court judgment and my immediate predecessors in this office issued letters to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in February 1997 and in April 1998 advising of the new procedure and requesting co-operation in its operation.

Any penalty points imposed are recorded on an individual's record in the national driver file, a centralised computerised record of licence holders, which is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.A contract for the development of the computerised fixed charge processing system, FCPS, was finalised and signed with the successful tenderer in September 2002. The request for tender document targeted a 15 month timeframe from commencement of the project for the supplier to develop the system. This will be followed by a period during which the system will be piloted and monitored before being rolled out nation-wide by the Garda. It is expected that implementation of the system throughout the State will commence in the second quarter of 2004 with the progressive extension of the system to cater for all penalty point offences taking place as quickly as possible thereafter.

The Department of Social and Family Affairs has published two reports under the families research programme entitled "Children's Experience of Parental Separation" and "Unhappy Marriages: Does Counselling Help?". However, neither report refers directly to the effects of relationship breakdown on the demand for social housing. The overall demand for social housing is indicated by the assessment of the need for local authority housing. This assessment is carried out in accordance with the Housing Act 1988 and gives a breakdown of those in need of social housing by family status without, however, specifying the marital status of persons on the waiting list. The most recent assessment was carried out in March 2002 and its results were published in the September quarter 2002 edition of the Housing Statistics Bulletin, which is available from the Oireachtas Library.The overall results of the recent assessment indicate that a total of 48,413 households were in need of local authority housing as at 28 March 2002. Of this total, some 43% are single person households with children. The assessment does not provide data on whether this figure relates to family breakdown or other circumstances. It is the stated objective of Irish housing policy to address all housing needs and in this way to promote the general welfare of society, including family stability.

Where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock. Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings.

These included channelling planning applications for particular large-scale strategic infrastructures directly to An Bord Pleanála, and establishing a special division of the High Court to deal specifically with infrastructural issues.In addition, the NCC report suggested that two further options might be considered: direct Oireachtas approval of particular infrastructure projects and establishing a specialist planning body with responsibility for assessing planning applications for infrastructure projects in the national interest, which would be independently resourced and operate in isolation from the current system.My Department is considering the efficiency of the planning approval system in respect of major infrastructure cases, including reviewing the board's record in dealing with such cases since the transfer of ministerial functions to the board on 1 January 2001. The NCC's recommendations will be considered in that context.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	959	Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with local sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the EPA. The agency publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, and a copy of its most recent report for the year 2001 is available  in the Oireachtas Library. Copies of the report have been sent by the EPA to all sanitary authorities. By way of a circular letter which will issue shortly to sanitary authorities, my Department will draw specific attention to recommendations, including those in relation to fluoridation, made by the EPA in its report and urge their early implementation.The EPA 2001 report is based on the results of some 146,000 individual tests on over 22,000 samples of drinking water taken from 2,440 supplies. The report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water, with an overall compliance rate of 94.3% with prescribed standards for all supplies, based on 14 principal parameters. The overall compliance rate in public water supplies with the fluoride standard was 95.5% in 2001, which represents an improvement from 94.0% in 2000.The European Communities (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the Abstraction of Drinking Water) Regulations 1989 prescribe quality standards in relation to a variety of parameters, including fluorides, for surface fresh water used or intended for use in the abstraction of drinking water. The regulations also prescribe methods of analysis and minimum frequencies of sampling and analysis for the prescribed parameters. The monitoring for fluorides provides information on the background level of fluorides in raw water prior to treatment for use as drinking water. Implementation of these regulations is a matter for sanitary authorities under the general supervision of the EPA. Information is not available in my Department concerning the number of fluoride determinations proposed by each sanitary authority under these regulations or the associated costs.The legislative basis for the use of fluoride in the treatment of public water supplies is the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children. Sanitary authorities fluoridate water supplies as agents of the health boards and the associated costs are recouped by the boards.The Act requires that background fluoride levels be taken into account when fluoridating water supplies. According to the EPA 2001 report, it appears that data collected on fluoride levels in surface raw water sources are not being taken into account by sanitary authorities in the fluoridation of drinking water and that this is an oversight that needs to be remedied. This aspect of the EPA report will be brought to the attention of sanitary authorities by my Department.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	961	The conditions governing the new house grant scheme normally preclude payment of a grant where a person who is party to a joint application or the spouse of such person had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his/her own occupation. However, a grant may be allowed where the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order or the person is separated under a court order or a deed or separation, and the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship. Each such application is considered on its merits. In this particular case, my Department is awaiting additional information requested from the applicant.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	962	The town renewal scheme which commenced in 100 smaller towns in 2000 has been extended by a further year to 31 December 2004. While progress on the scheme has been slower than anticipated there is now significant activity in the various towns designated. Statistical returns submitted by county councils showing the position at 31 December 2002 indicate that the total value of projects completed is €25 million and work in progress €30 million, with projects in planning valued at €75 million, giving an overall investment figure to date of some €130 million.It would be reasonable to estimate that this overall investment figure will rise even further as the scheme progresses. The further extension of the scheme together with the greater availability of section 23 residential investor reliefs introduced in the Finance Act, 2002 have given additional impetus to the scheme. With the enhanced incentives available and a pro-active approach by county councils to implementing and promoting the scheme, I am confident that significant progress can be achieved within the period of the scheme. My Department will continue to monitor the situation. I have no proposal to amend the scheme.

Section 67 of the Local Government Act 2001 empowers local authorities to promote the interests of the local community in relation to amenity, recreation and other func tions (including the incurring of expenditure). This includes the provision of playgrounds and play areas. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the extent to which playgrounds and play areas should be provided and to allocate resources accordingly. My Department does not operate a specific scheme of grants for playground or play area projects but does provide significant financial support to local authorities through the local government fund.

The programme of measures will be incorporated in the river basin management plan to be produced under article 13 of the directive.I am committed to full implementation of the water framework directive, which provides a comprehensive and systematic framework for the co-ordinated and sustainable management of waters on the basis of river basins throughout the European Union. In addition to co-ordination at national level, officials of my Department and other authorities are participating in working groups, research projects and other initiatives to promote consistent and co-ordinated implementation of the WFD at regional level, on a North-South basis, and in the European Union. My Department is promoting, in particular, the establishment by local authorities of regional projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required for implementation of the directive and for development of river basin management plans. Three such projects have already been fully approved in relation to the eastern region, the south-eastern region and the Shannon River basin and are being funded by my Department. Proposals for projects in relation to the western region and the south-west region are currently under consideration in my Department.

Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were recently agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group.As the Deputies will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership or community group. I am working with ADM and the partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reduction in funding this year.

Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were recently agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group.As the Deputy will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership or community group.However, I am working with ADM and the Partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reductions in the programmes and services provided.The information, requested by the Deputy, regarding the amount of funding allocated to the South Kerry Development Partnership and the Trá Lí Group in County Kerry for the period 1997-2003 follows:South Kerry Development Partnership

I expect that the responses to the letters will be crucial in informing the review process as it moves forward. As it happens, my Department will shortly meet the community development standing operations committee, which was set up by my Department and community development support programme groups for the purpose of discussing operational issues, to discuss the consultation process and to answer questions that the projects may have about the review process. In addition, my Department has offered to meet any of the projects' regional networks, including the south-east network, to discuss progress in the consultation and review process.

While my Department is not represented on the high level group on regulation, established by the Government in response to the OECD's report on regulatory reform in Ireland, my Department will continue to pursue the better regulation agenda in relation to legislative proposals which will be brought forward as the need arises.As I have already indicated in replies to recent Parliamentary Questions, the enactment of the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 is the main legislative priority of my Department at present. This Bill has been published and has now completed Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann. In addition, my Department also has responsibility for giving effect to the commitment under An Agreed Programme for Government, that: "A comprehensive reform of the law relating to charities will be enacted to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud". Work is currently in train so that legislative proposals to give effect to this commitment will be brought forward early in 2004.

The arrangement for someone working four or more days recognises the extra travel expenses a person may incur when working over a greater number of days per week.

The advertisement in question was removed from the website in the last month. All information relating to the back to education allowance on the website is accurate and up-to-date, since then.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	980	To qualify for an unemployment payment a person must be unemployed for at least three days in six consecutive days excluding Sunday. Where a person is employed on any part of a day she or he is not considered to be unemployed on that day. A person who works up to three days per week may, subject to overall earnings, qualify for the full weekly rate of unemployment assistance with a percentage of earnings deducted for each day worked.Where a person is employed over four or more days but for less than 30 hours per week and has insufficient means to meet his or her needs, supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, may be payable subject to overall household income. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, the person would be earning €31.75 per week –€6.35 x 5. From the information available and assuming he or she is single with no dependants and has no other means, the amount of SWA payable would be €93.05. However, the precise circumstances of each individual case would have to be considered.Entitlement to unemployment payments has always been based on a requirement of a minimum number of days unemployment in a specified period and any change in that regard would have fundamental consequences for the schemes. There are no plans at present for any changes to this qualifying condition.

Where a person does not wish to continue to receive carer's allowance and another person applies for the allowance for the same care recipient, a fresh application is required to determine whether the eligibility conditions are still met.A carer's allowance was paid in respect of the care recipient concerned up until June 2002. At that stage the carer opted to transfer to another social welfare payment. An application for carer's allowance was subsequently made by the person concerned in respect of the same care recipient. This application was refused, as the chief medical adviser of my Department expressed an opinion that the care recipient was no longer in need of full time care and attention. The person concerned was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of his right of appeal.This decision was appealed to the social welfare appeals office. Additional medical evidence was provided in support of this appeal and this was also reviewed by the chief medical adviser. An oral hearing was held on 19 March 2003. The appeals officer upheld the decision and disallowed the appeal. Notification to this effect issued on 26 March 2003. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	982	I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 453 to 455, inclusive, together.The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance educational scheme designed to assist unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups who are being held back in their search for employment by a lack of qualifications. A review of the basic purpose underlying my Department's back to education provisions was carried out recently. In the light of this and of the expenditure constraints facing us this year, the scheme has been revised.Regarding changes in the scheme as it relates to post graduates, I am satisfied that people in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a good level of academic attainment, which should impact positively on their employment prospects. In a time of financial constraint I want to ensure that supports are directed to those with more pressing needs. I have, however, instructed my officials to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify specific postgraduate courses, such as the Higher Diploma in Education, which add significantly to a person's employability and to which the back to education allowance should continue to apply. I expect these courses to be identified in the near future.At present there are 639 postgraduate students participating on the back to education scheme. There were 544 in the 2001-02 academic year and 524 in 2000-01 year. It is estimated that to exclude all persons in this category from the scheme would realise savings of between €3.5 million and €4 million annually.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	984	Where a carer is in receipt of another social security payment from another country, this payment is assessable as means for carer's allowance purposes. The person concerned was refused carer's allowance on 12 March 2003 on the basis that her weekly means derived from another social security payment exceed the statutory limit for receipt of the allowance. She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the independent appeals office. To date no appeal has been lodged. There is a general principle in the social welfare code that not more than one social welfare payment is paid to an individual at any one time and the present arrangements reflect that principle. Any change in the existing rules in this regard would have major impli cations and could only be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	985	There is no record of an application for an old age non-contributory pension in respect of the person concerned. However, she was in receipt of widow's non-contributory pension at the reduced weekly rate of €75.55. Payment of pension was discontinued by a deciding officer from 23 May 2000, as she failed to substantiate the alleged disposal of significant capital arising from the sale of her farm and dwelling. The assessment of means deriving from the sum involved is in excess of the limit for either of these pensions. An appeals officer subsequently upheld the deciding officer's decision. Her entitlement was reviewed in October 2002 and her application was refused on the same grounds.Until the issue of the disposal of the capital involved is satisfactorily accounted for, she will continue to be assessed with means deriving from the sum involved. Accordingly, she will need to furnish the required evidence in this regard before she can re-establish entitlement. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

From that date her weekly payment is €168.30.

He was awarded carer's allowance in respect of his mother with effect from 5 December 2002 at the maximum weekly personal rate of €129.60 per week. However, he was refused this allowance in respect of his father on the grounds that full time care and attention was not required in that case. He was notified of this decision, the reason for it and of his right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. There is no record of an appeal having been lodged in this case. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

It is estimated that some 380 schools, with a total of over 60,000 pupils, benefited from the urban scheme while 105 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited over 11,000 children under innovative school meals projects. This year I provided an additional €2.35 million in the budget in order to enhance and expand this service.In the school year to date, my Department has provided funding for a total of 67 local breakfast clubs in national schools. I do not have details available to me of breakfast clubs that operate without support from my Department and, therefore, cannot provide the information requested by the Deputy.

Under social welfare regulation, the rate of benefit payable depends on a person's level of earnings in the governing contribution year.Persons whose reckonable earnings in that year are less than €44.44 per week are currently entitled to payment at the rate of €56.10 per week.In the 2001 tax year which governed her claim to disability benefit, the person concerned was in receipt of carer's allowance. She qualified for credited contributions in respect of her carer's allowance but had no reckonable earnings in 2001. Therefore in her case, under current legislation, the correct rate of disability benefit is €56.10 per week.In view of the fact that the person concerned qualifies for disability benefit at a reduced rate, she may qualify for supplementary welfare allowance. She should contact her local community welfare officer who will advise her of any entitlement.
Questions Nos. 453 to 455, inclusive, answered with Question No. 445.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Prelude	990	Social Welfare legislation provides for a disqualification from receipt of unemployment assistance of students who are attending a full-time day course of study, instruction or train ing. This disqualification which extends over the holiday periods during the academic year including the summer vacation periods, until the completion of the course of study, does not apply to mature students or to those studying under the  Department's back to education allowance programme.Such students may qualify for unemployment assistance during the summer months subject to fulfilling the normal conditions of entitlement to the scheme.
