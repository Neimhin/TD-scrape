#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I am pleased to report to the committee on the Defence Forces' participation in UN missions in 2007 and 2008.  The reports for both years were laid before the Dáil on 28 November 2008 and 20 July 2009, respectively.  The following motions have been placed on the Order Paper for Dáil Éireann:That Dáil Éireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2007, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 28 November 2008, andThat Dáil Éireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2008, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 20 July 2009.In commending the motions to the committee, I will outline the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the United Nations in the past few years.A central tenet of foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in such operations since 1958, a service which has comprised more than 58,000 individual tours of duty.  During 2007 and 2008 the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN-authorised missions.  On average, 640 personnel were involved in UN-led and UN-mandated missions throughout 2007 and 660 personnel throughout 2008.In the past two years or so our largest overseas commitment was in Chad, with the deployment of a battalion of approximately 400 personnel with the UN-mandated and EU-led mission in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD-RCA, and the transfer of the Irish battalion to the follow-on UN-led mission since 15 March 2009.  During their service with EUFOR Irish troops were responsible for protecting and securing the area around the refugee and IDP camps to ensure the refugees could live free from fear of attack and that humanitarian aid was safely distributed to them.EUFOR's mandate expired on 15 March 2009 and the operation was replaced by the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT.  Approximately 400 Irish personnel deployed in Chad with EUFOR transferred to the authority of MINURCAT on 15 March 2009.  Currently, 419 members of the Defence Forces are serving in Chad.  Despite the initial challenges faced by MINURCAT, the mission continues to build on the solid foundation laid by EUFOR which has helped to prepare the way to build future successes and contribute to the long-term beneficial impact of a safe and secure environment.During 2007 and 2008 Ireland also continued its commitment to the western Balkans, with the Defence Forces committing approximately 220 members of the Permanent Defence Force to the international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR, and approximately 40 personnel to the EU-led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina - EUFOR Operation ALTHEA.  In 2008 the Irish infantry group serving with KFOR completed its additional role as framework lead nation for the multinational task force centre in KFOR during the 12 months from August 2007 to July 2008 which heightened the Defence Forces' profile as a professional and well organised force within the international peacekeeping community.The Defence Forces' contingents completed their service with the UN mission in Liberia, UNMIL, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, in May 2007 and October 2007, respectively.  At the request of the United Nations, seven personnel were retained at UNIFIL headquarters.Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the United Nations and the European Union.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations, and supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system and Ireland remains willing to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world.Ireland continues to build on a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis.  Notwithstanding the considerable undertaking which it represents, both in financial and personnel terms, the Government remains committed, with due regard to the safety of our troops, to the principle of military participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations in the cause of international peace.  This represents a huge contribution for a nation the size of Ireland and it has been made possible by the willingness of the people, represented by successive Governments, to play our part in assisting with conflict resolution by responding generously to calls from the United Nations during the years.  Our involvement in these peace support missions has greatly enhanced the professional capacity and capability of the Defence Forces which has, in turn, increased our value to the United Nations.  The appointment of Irish officers, Lieutenant-General Pat Nash as operation commander EUFOR TCHAD-RCA and Brigadier-General Gerald Aherne as deputy force commander MINURCAT, is another indication of the high regard in which Irish personnel are held internationally.The current economic challenges facing the country have resulted in the defence organisation being required to operate on a reduced budget for 2010.  As regards participation by the Defence Forces in overseas peace support operations, the key reductions in the defence budget for the next year will include the draw-down of the Defence Forces' contingents serving in Kosovo and Bosnia.  However, this measure is only temporary.  Once the current economic crisis is past, the Government will look again at potential overseas missions in order that we can maintain Ireland's proud record of peacekeeping.  Notwithstanding the difficult economic environment, the Government is committed to continuing Ireland's participation in the mission in Chad beyond mid-March, subject to the renewal by the UN Security Council of the mission's mandate.The nature of peacekeeping operations is changing from traditional UN-led missions such as MINURCAT to regionally-led peace operations, with the onus being placed on regional states to organise and assemble peacekeeping troops for the purpose of discharging a UN mandate.  These missions represent the trend in UN peacekeeping where missions operate under the control of an established command structure or a lead nation rather than under direct command of the United Nations.  This change has implications for the manner in which these operations are organised and structured, with much greater emphasis on bilateral relations with established military command structures such as NATO and the European Union and between participating states and troop contributing countries.  However, irrespective of the lead role in the mission, decisions on participation in a particular mission remain a sovereign issue which in Ireland's case means the mission must have a UN mandate and be approved by the Government and Dáil Éireann in accordance with Irish law.I commend the individual soldiers who have served and continue to serve on overseas missions, together with their families and loved ones.  Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas, under the auspices of the United Nations, would not be possible.  Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well not alone on the Defence Forces but also on the nation as a whole and contributes to the excellent reputation which Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Fifty years ago the then Minister for External Affairs and future Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, led Ireland into the United Nations.  My party is justifiably proud of this achievement, as we have always believed Ireland must have a strong international voice and that it should, in word and deed, campaign for human rights and the rule of international law.  Under successive Governments, that voice has been expressed clearly, something of which we can all be proud.The Defence Forces have been central to the role we have played in the United Nations.  Between 1960 and 2000, Ireland participated in 26 UN operations, far out of proportion to our size.  We currently have Defence Forces' members serving with 11 missions, with a further eight with UNIFIL in Lebanon, 12 with the United Nations truth supervision organisations in Syria and Lebanon, three with the United Nations mission monitoring the referendum in western Sahara, three with the United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, two with the United Nations mission in the Ivory Coast and 419 at headquarters and battalion level with the United Nations in the Central African Republic, 42 with the EU-led operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 20 as part of the international security presence in Kosovo and 216 at infantry level with KFOR, seven with the international security assistance force in Afghanistan, eight with the UN mission with the OSCE, seven with the EU military staff, four with Nordic battle group headquarters staff in Sweden and nine service military representatives with the European Union and NATO as part of delegations.  That is an indication of the spread of our military personnel across the globe and shows we are punching above our weight and have an extraordinary presence, given the size of the country.When the numbers of personnel involved in past and present UN missions are compared, the full scale of our participation becomes clear.  Although we have one of the smallest and least resourced armed forces, a review in the mid-1990s showed that at that stage we had contributed 42,000 personnel during the years for tours of duty.  This is a record of which the Defence Forces can be proud.  Fine Gael's appreciation of the international role played by the Defence Forces is positive.  We salute the bravery of the men and women who have served in the many places from Nigeria to Chad.The Minister has indicated where Defence Forces' personnel are serving.  As I mentioned, at the start of this year, Defence Forces' personnel were serving with 11 missions overseas, including MINURCAT in Chad, the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo and the EU-led force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as working with headquarters staff of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.I regret the Government's decision to reduce the commitment of members of the Defence Forces overseas from 748 to 480 through reducing our commitment to KFOR and Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Our participation in such forces is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces for a number of reasons.  As we are not part of an alliance but are militarily neutral, the scope to serve abroad is limited.  Limiting access to overseas missions is to risk limiting the Defence Forces' skills net and could have a knock-on effect on future missions because our participation is dependent on experience.  Cutting back on overseas participation could do long-term damage to our ability to participate in peace support missions.  I welcome, therefore, the Minister's commitment that this is a temporary measure and that if the economy recovers, we will return to the numbers currently serving.Speaking to personnel at all levels in the Defence Forces, it is clear they see participation in overseas missions as one of their primary roles.  Almost every member of the Defence Forces has served overseas at some stage, some of them several times.  They consider that is where they gain real experience.  As a result, although we are small in numbers, because of our involvement overseas, ours is a far more efficient and effective organisation.  This has been proved in Kosovo and elsewhere where the Defence Forces have proved very successful when it comes to interacting with peoples around the world because of their diplomacy and training as peacekeepers rather than being involved in military operations.  Communities trust them.  This element of their training will be missed in future EU and UN operations.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Fine Gael strongly supports the decision to continue Ireland's participation in MINURCAT in Chad.  I emphasised this opinion several times during Question Time and debates in the Dáil.  It is one of the most dangerous missions undertaken by members of the Defence Forces, which have earned widespread praise for their role.  I have no doubt but that MINURCAT has saved lives and helped to prevent greater intercommunal warfare in the Chad-Central African Republic area.According to my feedback from Chad, the Irish have excelled in that battle theatre.  They have developed a good rapport with the local community.  From speaking with people who were in the area recently, I know that the operation is going smoothly.  Only 60 of our rangers went there to choose a greenfield site and set up a camp in Goz Beida, but it is so effective and efficient that the UN is using it as an example of how to set up a proper camp for other missions.  We should be proud of their achievement.Security Council Resolution 1861 notes that MINURCAT is intended to help create security conditions conducive to a voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons, inter alia, by contributing to their protection and the protection of civilians in danger through facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance in eastern Chad and north-east Central African Republic and by creating favourable conditions for the reconstruction and economic and social development of those areas.  Our Defence Forces have been central in achieving this aim and we should be proud of their performance.With approximately 180,000 Chadians displaced by the civil war in eastern Chad and the appearance of so many armed groups threatening the security of refugees, MINURCAT and its predecessor, EUFOR, were vital in preventing communal violence from slipping into mass murder.  I reiterate my praise for the excellent work of Lieutenant-General Pat Nash, the operational commander of the EUFOR mission.  For an Irishman to be appointed as commander of one of the most sensitive missions ever mounted by an EU mission operating on a UN mandate showed the prestige and respect in which the Defence Forces are held abroad.  I recognise the work of Brigadier-General Ger Aherne, the deputy force commander.  From what I understand, he is effectively in command of the force because the commander works from New York.  Brigadier-General Aherne is commanding everything on the ground in Chad with that mission at the moment.The importance of having fully equipped, qualified and experienced Defence Forces cannot be underestimated.  This is why we have continuously raised in the Dáil the issue of the impact of the moratorium in the Defence Forces.  We know that without adequate staffing and the filling of posts, the Defence Forces cannot fulfil a full role both home and abroad.  I have welcomed the decision of the Government, notwithstanding the crisis in the Exchequer that the State faces, to allow for a waiving of the moratorium.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that problems with the numbers in the medical corps are sorted out as quickly as possible.I put down a question on that last week but there was an announcement in the newspapers before it was answered.  I would like the Minister to ensure that does not happen again, if possible.  The Minister mentioned there had been 40 promotions, with ten outstanding positions of priority which will be filled in future.  They should be filled as soon as possible as it is affecting morale.People may not be saying that to the Minister directly but from my information and speaking to people at the commission parade last week that I attended with Deputy O'Shea, I know there are deep and genuine concerns.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the positions are filled quickly.  There were approximately 150 Garda promotions approved in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform so there is a strong case for filling those ten places.A report relevant to the medical corps was commissioned by the Minister and is awaiting implementation.  I ask him to do this as soon as possible.  The absence of a fully staffed and equipped medical corps poses a long-term threat to the role of Ireland's Defence Forces in peace support missions.  A defence force requires fully functional units and inadequately staffed or experienced units risk endangering the ability of the whole force.As I understand it, in the Defence Forces missions abroad the personnel like Irish doctors and medical staff supporting them as much as possible.  Sometimes with foreign medical personnel in support, there could be a language problem or misunderstanding.  The support our personnel get abroad is as much psychological as medical and it is important to communicate properly.  The medical corps issue is important and although it is being addressed, it should be dealt with as soon as possible.I will ask the Minister a few direct questions as well.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The performance of Ireland's Defence Forces with the United Nations has been outstanding and worthy of praise.  I am glad we are addressing these two reports today and I hope the ability of the Irish Defence Forces to perform their overseas role is not affected by cutbacks and a lack of staff in crucial areas.  I urge the Minister to ensure that even in a time of cutbacks, the Defence Forces are adequately funded to allow them continue their vital work internationally with the United Nations.The humanitarian assistance by the Defence Forces overseas has been very successful in Liberia, Kosovo and now in Chad.  I understand our forces are becoming involved in providing community facilities like clinics, community centres and schools.  A better budget should be made available to the personnel.  It is unfair on them as in the past they have raised funds for these initiatives in their own communities in Ireland.  The aid provided in 2008 was just €54,380 for a number of projects supported by the Irish infantry groups serving with KFOR, for example.

I do not want them to become an overseas aid agency but where they are serving in communities and implementing initiatives, a small piece of the budget could be used in cases with worthwhile projects.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Ireland has been involved in peacekeeping since 1958 and there have been 57,000 individual tours of duty.  Against the size of our armed forces and population, that is something of which we can be proud.  I was in Chad last January and the Irish contingent seemed to be very well equipped compared to others.  There is a general feeling from talking to people that we are particularly good at what we do in terms of peacekeeping.  We are among the very best if not the best in that regard.This is an area of national provision that we operate well.  I have knowledge of a project relating to the mission to Liberia which came towards the end.  It was organised by the Army chaplains.  After a long period of war in Liberia, the schools had no books.  As it is an English-speaking country, a project was put together to get 40-foot containers out to Liberia, and my recollection is they cost about €3,600 each, with quite a few going out in the end with used schoolbooks in good condition.  Repairable computers and musical instruments were also sent.The Irish armed forces were particularly well positioned to deliver on this project because they had the logistical capability to distribute the books throughout the area.  It was a success in that the materials were delivered.  This was not a direct military operation but if the Minister has any further information on the mission's success, I would like to hear it.One concern comes against the background of the cutbacks that the Army must implement, with the Defence Forces being cut from 10,500 to a little below 10,000.  The Minister has a commitment to bring the forces up to 10,000.  As it stands, the Defence Forces are quite stretched, and against that background is the overall question of whether the Defence Forces can maintain their status as a credible organisation.  With the withdrawal from Kosovo and Bosnia, there will be more Defence Forces personnel here, which may have a positive effect on the operations carried out by the organisation.  We are all pleased to hear that the Kosovo project will not be renewed.The Minister has indicated that these operations are moving away from UN-led missions.  The triple lock will obviously continue, as there has to be a UN mandate.  We did not get a refund from the EUFOR mission, so if the refund from the UN-led missions ceases, that seems to suggest that we will have less capability in future to take part in overseas missions.  I hope I am wrong here, but that is how it appears to me.There have been allegations made that rape is prevalent in the camps out in Chad.  I do not know the extent of this, but there is also domestic violence in the camps.  What are the capabilities of the armed forces to intervene in these situations?  I would like to see these situations dealt with in an effective way.  There are problems with access to the camps and so on.  I saw one of the camps in Chad.  We were not allowed go into the camp, and it was one of those camps that developed as refugees arrived there.  We were on a hill overlooking it, so we did not get in, although we met some of the elders.  The Defence Forces contingent needs to be able to deal effectively with problems, such as the unacceptable serious violence or anti-social behaviour, as they arise.We do extremely well in these areas.  It is unfortunate that we are currently pulling back on what we have been doing, due to budgetary matters and due to the fact that we are moving from a UN led mission to a regionally led mission.  That suggests to me that we will become more and more involved in EUFOR type missions.I was also in Chad when the UN camp was being constructed.  There was quite an Irish presence involved and it was an impressive operation.  We did not get to see the Irish camp at Goz Beida, as I was travelling with a group from the WEU.  I met some of the Irish members serving there, including Lieutenant Commander Tommy Doyle, whom I met at the Curragh last Thursday as well.  I was most impressed with the professionalism of our people out there.  I am pleased to support the two motions that have been placed on the Dáil Order Paper.  We have done very well and continue to do so.  My hope is that the current budgetary constraints will soon disappear and we can get back to where we were and increase what we do in the trouble spots of the world.  We do it very well and make a real contribution.  The more of that we can do, the better as a nation we serve those in danger spots around the world.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil do na saighdiúirí atá thar lear ag déanamh oibre rí-chrógach agus rí-thábhachtach don tír seo.  I commend the soldiers serving abroad.  They are serving a proud tradition and they have helped increase Ireland's esteem abroad.  We are well respected for that.I may have been too harsh in the past with my description of some of the missions.  My initial description of the mission to Chad was as an imperialist adventure.  Given the imperialist history of some of the other countries involved in that mission and the vested interest they had in the area, I think I had grounds for my suspicions, and I may still have such grounds.  However, under General Nash the Irish contingent has set about ensuring that Ireland's proud tradition was not tainted in any way by the mission.  In fact, the exact opposite occurred.When we initially debated sending a force to Chad, I stated my preference that Ireland should be involved more and more in UN-led missions, given our neutral military position over the years.  The shift from the initial Chad mission to what is currently in place bears that out.  That comes from an ideological view I have on the tradition of military neutrality.  Given our circumstances at the moment, it also makes economic sense.  Even though the Minister has said the restrictions are there due to current economic challenges and that there will be a draw-down of Defence Forces contingents serving in Kosovo and Bosnia, I encourage him to look elsewhere and find other UN-led missions which would allow us to operate at our full capacity.  I do not know the exact percentage of soldiers that can operate, but we can operate at full capacity and enjoy the reimbursement of whatever is our entitlement, which would substantially reduce the cost of overseas missions.I have a problem with a different issue.  The modus operandi of our continued involvement in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan is a flagrant breach of our neutrality and the much hyped triple lock system.  The British Prime Minister and the Afghan President were discussing the continuance of that operation today.  Ireland sends 14 soldiers to Afghanistan annually.  There is no Dáil debate on it.  There is no Dáil motion to authorise it, despite the triple lock guarantee which states that if 12 soldiers are sent to any theatre of war or mission abroad, Dáil approval should be sought.  Since 2002, over 100 soldiers have served in Afghanistan with little or no discussion by the Dáil at any stage.  The triple lock was one of the mechanisms produced during the debates on the Nice and Lisbon treaties to ensure Irish troops would only participate in overseas operations, including those carried out under European policy, ESDP, subject to a Government decision and with UN authorisation.  In all instances we should seek Dáil approval, even down to a single member serving as a military representative to the NATO Partnership for Peace in Belgium or the two members liaising in Brussels with the Partnership for Peace.  A motion should be tabled in the Dáil annually seeking authorisation for soldiers who will be overseas for any lengthy period, anything over three months.  Dáil approval would be granted for many of these instances and probably for all, given that it would be a Government decision but at least we could have a debate on it.  The problem with the debate here is that we are discussing reports over one year old.  The discussion is too late.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	11	A Chathaoirligh agus a chomhghleacaithe, ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an díospóireacht seo.  Is mór an onóir é seans a bheith agam buíochas a ghabháil le hÓglaigh na hÉireann as ucht an tseirbhís iontach atá tugtha acu ar feadh blianta fada - seirbhís áitiúil i réigiúin na tíre seo, seirbhís náisúnta ar son na tíre agus seirbhís idirnáisiúnta ar fud an domhain.  Táimid an-bhródúil as gach ball.I endorse what colleagues said and I am honoured to pay tribute to the Defence Forces in every aspect of their operations and in all sectors in which they specialise.  We can be proud of their contributions to our country as flagship carriers for the nation and as pioneers in international development for our country who have given outstanding, legendary service in some of the most risk-prone situations throughout the world since 1958.I also pay special tribute to the Minister and his management team for the modernisation of the Defence Forces.  I also pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor and the management team that worked with him.  There has been major investment in modernising the Defence Forces to ensure we can compete with the best in the world, taking into account our size as a nation, our GDP, our economic resources and our population base.  This also takes into account our proud membership of the UN and the EU.  With the changes in the EU after the Lisbon treaty, I am confident there will be a greater requirement for members of our Defence Forces to be part of the rapid response units to deal with serious humanitarian and human rights situations in various parts of the world.  Anyone who has had the opportunity to travel to operations under the control of the UN, where Irish forces have served, has seen the respect the people on the ground have for our forces' officers and members, the men and women who serve at international level on behalf of our country under the blue flag of the United Nations.  Their dedication, even-handedness, respect for human rights and people management skills are second to none.  As a result, they are always acceptable in different parts of the world and in various conflict zones.  We can be proud of their contribution and grateful for the risks they have taken.  We pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of this country in the interests of global peace.Various aspects of development to which the Minister and colleagues have referred will continue to be addressed, taking into account the resources available to the Government as we continue to manage our way out of the current situation.  That is the challenge for us and the Government must be seen to be equitable in the allocation of resources and its treatment of all aspects of public services, whether in the Defence Forces or elsewhere.  I empathise with the Minister's challenge in trying to manage resources that are not available to the same extent today as in the past.  On behalf of my constituents I take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the Defence Forces which, as an aid to civil power at the request of the Garda Síochána, have been exemplary in their dedication and service to our people, particularly in Galway East, during the recent floods, frost and snow.  We appreciate the response they gave, the work they did and the assistance they were to the people.There is an opportunity for the Minister and the Defence Forces to ensure we have an annual day where we can showcase the Naval Service in a sail-by operation.  This should be an annual event at some port town in the country.  It would be very good for the morale of the Naval Service and would provide an opportunity for the people of Ireland to recognise the resources deployed, the quality of the people involved and the facilities they have as they serve our country in different ways.  I ask the Minister to consider this.I pay tribute to everyone who has served our country in uniform as part of the Defence Forces.  We are deeply grateful for that legendary service.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I apologise for being late for this meeting.  I will not reiterate what Deputy Treacy said but I concur with him.  With regard to the recent difficult weather conditions, I concur with the comments of Deputy Treacy.  The Army provided great assistance in Meath East.  I pay tribute to the Army and in particular to the services available at Gormanston Camp.  These are used in preparation for many of the UN and EU missions abroad.  I acknowledge the Government's ongoing commitment to this facility.  I assume that commitment will remain and the facilities in County Meath will continue to be made available.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank members of the committee for their recognition of the importance of the contribution of Ireland and the Defence Forces to international peace and security.  I am particularly grateful for the kind words and compliments from Deputies regarding the manner in which the Defence Forces discharged themselves on these missions.  The contributions made by the members of the committee reflect the high regard in which the Defence Forces are held internationally as peacekeepers and the warm regard in which the Irish people hold our Defence Forces.  They recognise the important role they play in the communities they serve here and abroad.  The Defence Forces have brought great honour to Ireland through their participation in peace support missions.  This has been demonstrated once again by the appointment of Lieutenant-General Pat Nash as operation commander of the UN-mandated EU mission to the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic and the current appointment of Brigadier-General Gerald Aherne as deputy force commander of the United Nations mission in Chad.  These prestigious appointments reflect well not only on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole and this contributes to the excellent reputation Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world.  However, participation in peacekeeping operations is not without risk.  In that regard we should recall the members of the Defence Forces who have paid the ultimate price in the cause of peace, as referred to by Deputy Treacy.Deputy Deenihan referred to the withdrawals from Bosnia and Kosovo.  The current mission in Bosnia is in the course of transition to a training and support operation, which will comprise 200 personnel in total.  I will consider whether to retain any Defence Forces presence in the follow-on EU training and support mission.  It is being scaled down anyway.  The situation in Kosovo is somewhat different.  It has improved dramatically and NATO is in the process of downsizing the mission from 14,000 personnel to approximately 2,000 personnel.  This will take place over the next 12 months.  Perhaps we are moving more quickly than we originally anticipated but it occurs in that context.  Deputies Deenihan, O'Shea, Ó Snodaigh, Thomas Byrne and Treacy praised Irish personnel for what they have done in Chad and referred to their rapport with the local community.  Deputy Deenihan noted that the Irish camp is viewed as a model for the UN.I am assured that the recruitment moratorium will not affect the capacity of the Defence Forces to do their job at home or abroad.  I acknowledge Deputy Deenihan's point about filling vacancies as quickly as possible and give my commitment to do so.  I am negotiating with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on filling vacancies and general recruitment in order to maintain a minimum strength of 10,000.The report of the medical consultants was discussed at some length in the Dáil last week.  Progress is being made, although it cannot be measured over a short period.Questions have been raised about the humanitarian assistance rendered by the Defence Forces overseas.  Deputy Deenihan recommended that we seek funding for these activities from our overseas aid budget.  I will take money wherever I can get it.  I have seen troops in Liberia and Chad put their hands in their own pockets to fund projects.  Deputy O'Shea asked about second hand books and computers for Chad.  I am sure this initiative has been successful but I will revert to him with an update.The Deputy also asked whether the cutbacks will affect the Defence Forces as a credible organisation.  We have already received certain exemptions from the moratorium and I am confident I can get more.Questions were asked about the difference between EU and UN led missions.  When the UN takes the lead, participating countries receive rebates, which in the case of Chad is approximately half our annual outlay of €16.2 million.  It is economically more attractive to participate in missions for which half our expenditure is rebated.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh called on us to focus on UN-led missions but the difficulty is that increasing numbers of missions are organised on a regional basis.The issue of rape in camps in Chad is a difficult one.  The UN mandate does not include general policing so troops do not have clearance to seek out and punish rapists.  If such crimes occur in their presence they will of course intervene, however.Deputy Treacy asked about the modernisation programme, which we hope to continue.  He also referred to the 85 Irish soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.  That figure includes one soldier whose body has never been found.Deputies Treacy and Thomas Byrne expressed their appreciation of the work done by Defence Forces members during the recent weather crisis.  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked about Gormanston Camp, which will continue in operation.We contribute seven Defence Forces members to the mission in Afghanistan on six month rotations.  They are based in headquarters in Kabul.  This mission is sanctioned by the UN and a debate in the Dáil is not required if fewer than 12 personnel are involved.  Perhaps the reason for this provision is because we dispatch individuals to a considerable number of missions throughout the world and it would not be appropriate to require Dáil approval for every one of them.  The Deputy suggested omnibus annual reports on all overseas missions.  That is the purpose of today's meeting, although I am happy to consider reporting to the entire Dáil if he so proposes.

I ask that contact details for responsible Defence Forces members be made available to local authorities in the event of future requests for aid to the civil powers.  A breakdown appears to have occurred in communication and no mention was made of the Defence Forces prior to my raising the matter on 7 January.  The Minister's response was that he was not asked earlier.  We must make it clear to local authorities that the Defence Forces are available for road gritting or transport assistance.

That should be simple to arrange.  Limerick County Council claims to have contacted the Army but this is denied by the latter.  A misunderstanding clearly arose at some point.  I hope we never see a repeat of the weather we experienced over Christmas but we have to learn lessons from the experience.  While the Army cannot be everywhere, it has useful equipment which it can make available in an emergency.I ask the Minister to seek to increase the allocation for humanitarian assistance during overseas operations.  Irish Aid's funding in this area was €54,000 in 2008 but the amount collected by mission personnel was significantly greater.  It is important that personnel are involved in community projects because the best way to build confidence among the local populations is to build something for them, such as a community centre or a sports pitch.  This is one of the elements that the Minister might discuss with the Defence Forces to see how it can be improved.  It is always an issue as to how we use the money but every cent can be accounted for when it is used by the Defence Forces so there is very good value for money.

A service medal is awarded to personnel.  The previous mission received a EUFOR medal and it then became a United Nations mission.  The personnel involved were very anxious to be awarded a UN medal.  I understand there was a precedent for such an award in the past in Cyprus where there had been a changeover of mission and members of the mission were granted UN medals.  I do not know what is the difference in prestige between a EUFOR medal and a United Nations medal but I made a case at the time and it could be revisited by the Minister.  I wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations and I received an acknowledgement stating that this should be considered in the case of those personnel who had been in the transitional stage.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I know we are not discussing local authorities in this forum but I refer to the emergency services which can be provided by the Defence Forces.  In response to a question I asked last week, the Minister replied that he had written to county and city managers informing them of the services available.  Has the Minister received any response from county managers and if there has not been a response, is there a need to arrange a more formal liaison in this regard?The Minister will recall that 16 members of the Reserve Defence Force were to go on overseas missions towards the end of last year but this was postponed for financial reasons.  The Minister informed me in his reply that the personnel going overseas would be specialists.  I have two issues in this regard.  I know there are financial difficulties about recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force but in any case, the level of recruitment was not what was hoped for.  Many skilled people are now unemployed and this may well be the time to seek to involve those people in the Reserve Defence Force.  If the prospect of serving overseas with the Permanent Defence Force was a possibility it would be a way of providing people with valuable training and participation in the type of missions we have lauded for their effectiveness.  The fact that Ireland has no colonial baggage helps us to be accepted on overseas missions.I refer to the issue of rape which unfortunately in these trouble spots tends to be a significant problem.  Can the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, seek to enhance the policing role of the Defence Forces on overseas missions, whether those are UN missions or regionally organised?  Policing may well mean having trained police personnel on these missions and liaison with the appropriate courts services in those areas so people would know there was a system in place to deal with a crime such as rape.  I am conscious there is a weakness there.  I ask for the Minister's response on whether progress can be made in this regard.

What percentage of the Army can operate overseas at any given time?  Deputy O'Shea touched briefly on my next question.  Is there a plan to allow the Cúltaca an Airm to operate overseas on UN missions?  The Minister may not have a date for the gradual withdrawal of Irish soldiers from Kosovo.  The Minister stated there may be a recruitment campaign in the near future.  I know of people who would like to serve in the Army in this State whose skills would be vital to the Army but who are looking to the United States, Australia and elsewhere and it would be preferable not to lose this calibre of people.  What is the total cost to date of the mission in Afghanistan?  In a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said it was €270,000 annually, which would equate to nearly €2 million.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Deputy Deenihan referred to the weather crisis.  Obviously lessons have been and will be learned.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department, is doing a report on what it has learned.  I have asked the emergency planning office to report to me.  The letter referred to has not yet come to me for signature but I will ask about it.I understand that with regard to humanitarian aid, the troops tell us which humanitarian projects they wish to become involved with and we pass on the request to Irish Aid.  This is how the allocation is determined.  The difficulty in Chad is there are no humanitarian projects being undertaken there because of the security situation.With regard to Deputy Deenihan's question about the medal, a person must serve 90 days and the Deputy referred to a situation where people had not been long enough with EUFOR and then moved to MINURCAT.  If a person serves 90 days with MINURCAT he or she is entitled to a United Nations medal.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I will check the Cyprus precedent.In answer to Deputy Brian O'Shea, I have not yet received that letter for signature.  The difficulty with the Reserve Defence Force serving overseas is that the law will need to be changed.  Under current legislation the Reserve Defence Force is not allowed serve overseas.  We were hoping to recruit members of the Reserve Force into the Permanent Defence Force on a temporary basis and then allow them to serve overseas.  These would be people with specialist occupations such as engineers, transport experts etc.  Unfortunately we were hampered by the moratorium.  I will discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance but I have other priorities with regard to the moratorium, as the Deputy will understand.My experience with regard to recruitment is that many people wish to join the Reserve Defence Force.  The McCarthy report suggested a reduction in the size of the Reserve Defence Force by two thirds but we have not done that; we have saved some money by allocating fewer paid training days.  We have set a figure of what the Reserve Defence Force stood at on 1 January 2009, which was something in excess of 7,000.  We will recruit up to that level.On the rate issue, the difficulty is that the terms of reference are set by the relevant United Nations resolution.  It decides to what extent civilian policing is to be part of the operation.  The UN decides how many police to send.  For example, on the Chad mission, the maximum number provided for is approximately 5,500, which includes approximately 300 police.  Approximately half that number is currently in the field, which as far as I know does not include any police.  Perhaps the mission is waiting to stabilise the situation a little more before the police become involved.Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked a number of specific questions.  The percentage is 10%.  Again, I have dealt with the situation on the RAF.  He inquired about the total cost of the mission to Afghanistan to date.  I will find that out.  The annual cost at the moment is €270,000.  He also inquired about Kosovo.  In April the number of personnel there will be down to 50.  We will finish up there in October.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-01-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The McCarthy report recommended that we reduce the size of the Defences Forces from 10,500 to 10,000.  He recommended that we do it over two to three years.  We have already exceeded our target.  Currently, we are 23 under the 10,000 target figure.  The Government is committed to maintaining the numbers at 10,000.  I assure the Deputy that he is not the only one getting requests about when recruitment to the Army will take place.  As recently as yesterday on my way to the Dáil a bus pulled up at a bus stop and the driver came to the door to inquire when I would be recruiting to the Army.  We are receiving a lot of queries on the matter.  We lose a number of people each month.  I estimate that recruitment might take place in March or April.  I will try to get a more specific answer for the Deputy in that regard.
