#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Taoiseach has a different personality from his predecessor.  While sometimes I despair for our country, I admire the resilience and patience of our people.  One of the most shameful acts in political life has been the decision of the Minister for Education and Science to remove teachers from 900 special needs pupils——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	——at a time when we speak of fairness, solidarity, the type of people we are , the need for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel and at a time of financial turmoil and uncertainty.  The Taoiseach has an opportunity to break the golden circle of developers, banks, regulators and Government.  Far too cosy cartels have existed to the consternation and deep anger of people on the streets.  We are in a mess where the Fraud Squad is investigating, the Committee of Public Accounts cannot call before it people to give evidence in terms of public accountability——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	——we continue to deal with the entrails of a range of tribunals and nobody in Government accepts responsibility for any actions of Government.  We are in this mess not because Fianna Fáil policies have failed but because they have succeeded.  As the Minister for Finance has said, this is where the people wanted us to go and the position at which they wanted us to arrive.  We have now come to a shuddering halt.The transfer of €7 billion from Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank took place when there was a run on that bank during the final quarter of the financial year.  Was the Government aware of the extent of the transfer involved?  Did the Financial Regulator inform the Government of the transfer of €7 billion from Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank?  More important, did the treatment of that transfer of money, either as a loan or as a deposit, not send out a misleading statement or perception to shareholders of both institutions and to international markets?The Financial Regulator knew about this.  The Minister for Finance told us in the House that Anglo Irish Bank was being nationalised owing to the unethical loan practises of the previous chairman.  If that were the case and the Financial Regulator informed the Department of Finance of the transfer, how can the Taoiseach justify the Department of Finance signing off on a special  bonus of the type awarded to the previous Financial Regulator?  I accept he has statutory entitlements but this payment goes beyond normal terms and conditions.  Given the Financial Regulator knew of the transfer of €7 billion, a massive deposit, by Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank, can the Taoiseach justify that payment and will he explain to the House why that happened?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is important to point out that these issues with Anglo Irish Bank are the subject of various investigations.  This is based on information from the Financial Regulator and the due diligence exercised, which was undertaken as part of the planned recapitalisation of the bank.  The information was also provided by the new board of the bank.  I am confident the new board, appointed by the Minister for Finance, under the chairmanship of Donal O'Connor will follow up on all of these issues.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement is also conducting an investigation independently in that respect.

While I understand people's anger about these matters, it is action that will deal with this issue.  There is a very serious situation with which we must deal.  As the House knows, we brought forward a guarantee system in September in order to bring stability to the banking system in the interests of protecting businesses, protecting as many jobs as is absolutely possible and making sure people can conduct their business in the normal way with a functioning banking system.  That guarantee will be paid for by those who avail of it to the tune of approximately €1 billion during the course of the term in which the guarantee is provided to those institutions.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	As the House knows, we are also in the process of finalising arrangements regarding recapitalisation.  The recapitalisation of banks is about ensuring once again that we provide much-needed stability in the banking system for the benefit of the real, wider economy.  The portrayal of the recapitalisation policy as being in some way simply for the provision of bankers is incorrect.  It is about maintaining stability in the banking system at this critical time.

I also understand that the former chief executive had two years remaining on that contract, but having regard to independent legal advice and his exclusive availability to the authority for a period of three months, the authority agreed to payments of an additional €151,500——

That is the decision of the regulatory authority in regard to that particular matter.

Anger alone, while understandable and justifiable in many respects in terms of the history behind all of this, will not be the solution to the problem.  Action is needed.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Government is determined to take that action during the course of today as part of an ongoing response to ensuring we maintain stability in our banking system at a very difficult time internationally and domestically.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I asked two questions.  Did the treatment of the transfer of €7 billion from Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank send out a misleading perception of the strength of the bank and therefore have an impact on shareholders and on the international markets in the way they considered this?  That is the question.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Did the Government know about it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Taoiseach has not justified in any way the special bonus for the former regulator.  The Minister for Finance could have sacked the regulator if he felt he was not up to his job, in which case all of these matters would have fallen.  There is clearly a need for the Taoiseach to smash this circle once and for all, and to be seen to do that in such a way that if people who accept positions of responsibility abuse those positions or fail to live up to their remit, these special golden handshakes should not be paid.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I understand the Government is due to announce its recapitalisation programme today or tomorrow, certainly this week.  First, within that recapitalisation programme, is the Taoiseach looking for guarantees that pools of money will be made available for mortgages for first-time buyers, for small and medium-sized enterprises and for sufficient funds to enable existing businesses that might be in distress to trade their way out of that?Second, will he insist that remuneration levels for top executives will not be dealt with by percentage but will be capped?  There are many people in this country who have expertise in the financial area and who would willingly work in the nation's interest for a capped level of remuneration, not a reduction of expenses, where salaries are still extraordinarily high by Irish standards.Finally, I have continuing doubts about the consequences of putting €7 billion of taxpayers' money into a recapitalisation programme.  While I called for such a programme last November as a forerunner of an operational banking system, this may not be the most prudent use of taxpayers' money and the Government could well find itself in a situation where it is coming back for more at some time in the future.  Can the Taoiseach justify the Government's proposal to take €7 billion of taxpayers' money to bridge a gap that is clearly of unknown depth and unknown consequence?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Does the Taoiseach know about the €7 billion?

The new board of Anglo Irish Bank obviously took a view in regard to this question.  Investigations are being conducted of foot of this and that process must be given the opportunity to go through its various stages, which is being done.  The investigations are ongoing in regard to that matter.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	29	When did the Taoiseach become aware of it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	30	On the other question regarding the capitalisation of the bank, we are seeking to ensure there is additional credit over and above what was provided last year for business.  We made that point in the policy statement we issued in December, calling for a greater amount of money to be made available for first-time buyers and people who wish to take out mortgage commitments.  This has been part of the ongoing discussions.On the question of the recapitalisation itself, the Deputy makes the point that he felt a recapitalisation should have taken place sooner.  It is because of the prudent approach and the advice we are taking, and the work that has been undertaken based on various stress tests and scenarios which are prudent and proper in assessing the capital needs of the banks going forward, that we will find in what way we can contribute to stability and what sort of figure would be regarded as sufficient in those circumstances, as matters stand.We have been conducting this with the best of advice to the Department of Finance.  The figures that would be coming forward if the Government makes a decision later this afternoon are not plucked from the air.  They are based on an assessment as to what is required in the interests of the stabilisation of the banking system and its ability to work through its provisions.I spoke yesterday, and the suggestion is made in comment today in various newspapers, about predictions on the performance of various assets.  Once assets are diagnosed as bad debts, they are provided for in the accounts.  The stress testing and the various scenarios that are worked out by those who advise on this matter to Government and to the Department are such that we are devising the amount of money that would be required in the interests of the wider economy, of jobs, of ordinary people conducting their business on a daily basis and of having a functioning banking system with which to do that.  That is the whole purpose, and no other, behind why we are conducting this policy and why we are bringing ourselves to the position where a decision can now be taken by the Government on these matters.There will be ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the situation to see in what way risk is managed into the future.  There is no means by which we would put this behind us and suggest that is the end of the matter.  We are approaching in a prudent, cautious and comprehensive way the maintenance of stability in the banking system, first, through the guarantee system, which is being paid for, and, second, by a capitalisation programme, which is being paid for by a coupon and in which greater interest will be available to the Government than what is available at present for the money that is being provided.  This will ensure the Government also gets the upside in the event of shares returning to more normal trends in the years ahead.

We did so because we believed we were not being told the full story and that the taxpayer was not being told what was involved with that guarantee.  It turns out we did not know the half of it.  It turns out on that very day, Irish Life & Permanent was shuffling €4 billion by way of a loan——
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It was €7 billion.

Why would it not do so?  There was no risk involved for the bank, because the taxpayer was taking the risk.  It could lend Anglo Irish Bank billions of euro.  It was our money and if it went wrong, we would pick it up.  The Government could impose some more levies on working people to get it back.It appears the banks can lend thousands of millions of euro to each other, but at the same time they cannot extend several thousand euro to viable businesses to keep going.

The Government, which presided over all of this, imposes levy after levy on hard working people to pay for this largesse.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea of the degree of anger which exists among people, especially working people?  This includes workers in the private sector who are losing their jobs because of the credit squeeze, and workers in the public sector who are being asked to pay this so-called pensions levy?I seek some straight answers today.  When did the Taoiseach become aware this money was lent by Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank?

The Taoiseach made a very interesting comment on the day of the bank guarantee, to which I refer.  The Taoiseach stated he would expect that the banks would help each other out.  I remember that comment, because I remember putting the question as to whether the taxpayer would end up having to pay.  The Taosieach stated that the banks would help each other out.

The decisions made on 30 September were in the interests of maintaining stability in the banking system and the economy, based on advice from the Governor of the Central Bank, the regulatory authorities and the Department of Finance, and from no other source.  I wish to make that very clear.  This innuendo has been going around for long enough.  Everything the Government is doing regarding this matter to bring stability to the banking system is on the basis of our assessment of the national interest and the seriousness of the situation confronting the country.  I refute any suggestion to the contrary; it is without foundation.

The Government was in discussion with the banks.  We were told on 30 September that the Government was in discussions with the banks.  Arising from those discussions, the Taoiseach came before the House and effectively asked the Dáil to hand over the deeds of the country to bail out the banks in a guarantee scheme.

They were also making a monkey of the public, which was asked to put up the money and the guarantee.  The Taoiseach says he did not know of this on 30 September.  When did he find out?We now have a serious problem in the banking system and a serious loss of confidence, domestically and internationally.  Everyone knows it is critical for the country that confidence is restored.The Taoiseach's proposed bank recapitalisation scheme, the details and conditions of which we have yet to examine, is aimed at restoring confidence internationally to the Irish banking system.  However, he will not restore confidence to the Irish banking system, recapitalisation scheme or no, while we have this drip, drip emergence of one thing after another occurring in these banks.  First, we found out about directors receiving loans and shoving money around between one bank and another.  Then there was the matter of contracts for difference.  Now, we hear the banks were moving money around between one another.  When did the Taoiseach become aware of these loans?  When did the Minister for Finance and the Department become aware?  We are entitled to know.  There has been far too much drip, drip information.  The Government must level with the public.  There is public money involved, which apparently will be put into the banks, and more public money will have to be used if everything goes seriously wrong.  The people, whose money the Government is now playing with and who are being asked to raise this money, are entitled to know when the Government knew these arrangements were in place between the banks and when this loan was made.  Will the Taoiseach explain this to the House?

That was an important decision.  These were banks of systemic importance.  We were advised at official level that the scheme should be brought into play and that was done.  It brought stability to the banking system and improved the situation considerably.  In fact other Governments have followed on from that.  In December, we brought forward a recapitalisation policy statement.  Subsequently, as I made clear, in the due diligence that was conducted it became clear that it was in the interest of the country that the bank be nationalised.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.If a Minister were to receive a gift worth more than €650 from a State agency, it would be deemed to be a gift given by virtue of office and would have to be surrendered to the State.  It would also have to be declared in the Minister's annual statement of registerable interests.As regards hospitality, I assume that the Deputies are not referring to a situation where Ministers travel abroad in the course of, and for the performance of, their duties and their travel expenses and accommodation are paid for by the State agency on behalf of which they are travelling.  For obvious reasons, restrictions in the code of conduct for officeholders published by the Standards in Public Office Commission, which I will refer to in a moment, do not apply to any offer or supply of property or a service made "in the course of and for the purpose of performance of duties of an officeholder, for example, hotel facilities or attendance at EU Council meetings, including a representational role by a spouse where this is in accordance with established practice".As regards hospitality otherwise, the code of conduct for officeholders sets out, among other things, a framework for the acceptance of hospitality by officeholders.  Briefly, the code provides that officeholders should not accept offers of hospitality where to do so would, or might appear to, place them under an obligation.  The code also provides that officeholders should not accept offers to meet the costs of travel facilities and-or commercial accommodation in connection with official activities where such offers are made by private citizens or private enterprises, but that discretion may be used where an officeholder is the official guest of another Government or official body, or of a not-for-profit representative organisation or the like.The Department of Finance's code of practice for the governance of State bodies provides a corporate governance best practice framework under which State agencies are required to conduct their business.  Among other things, it provides that State agencies should avoid providing hospitality which might affect or appear to affect the ability of the donor or the recipient to make independent judgments on business transactions.The code of practice recognises that it is not feasible to provide specifically for all situations which will arise.  It reminds directors and employees of State agencies, therefore, that it is primarily their responsibility to ensure that all their activities, whether covered specifically or otherwise by the code, are governed by the ethical and other considerations implicit in it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	When a Minister travels abroad on behalf of his or her Department, the position is well known, transparent and open to scrutiny.  It appears from the investigations into FÁS that the same does not apply there.  If a Minister accepts a trip or hospitality from a State agency, there does not seem to be the same level of awareness as if the Minister travels on behalf of his or her Department.  For example, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs were to travel to some country at the invitation of a State agency as distinct from the Department of Foreign Affairs, that would not show up in the same way.  Is the Taoiseach happy about that?  What safeguards are being put in place to ensure that there is absolute transparency about such trips?I accept the Taoiseach's bona fides in wanting to do things in the public interest here but I find it incredible that, because of the constraints arising from the Abbeylara case, the Committee of Public Accounts is unable to subpoena witnesses who have clear information about elements of this case.  That is not in the public interest.  We should be able either to write legislation within the context of the Abbeylara finding or have a referendum to allow the Oireachtas deal with these persons in semi-State agencies or whatever part of Government applies, when the need arises.When I asked the Taoiseach last June about FÁS, he said that he held the then chief executive in the highest regard and would defend his integrity at all times.  Is the Taoiseach happy that since that time structures have been put in place which allow for oversight of hospitality extended to Ministers within agencies such as FÁS for instance?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	It is the normal arrangement that when Ministers travel abroad in the course or performance of their duties, their travel expenses and accommodation are paid for by the State agency on behalf of which they are travelling.  It is right that this should be the case because the Minister is conducting duties in performance of his or her office.  I am sure that lessons are being learned from the various issues arising out of FÁS.  Mr. Ed O'Sullivan, a former Secretary General at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the public service, is the interim chief executive officer and is au fait with the various guidelines in respect of these matters.  He also has an overall capacity to help guide the agency in the transition period pending the appointment of a long-term head of the organisation.It is my view that those issues which have arisen are lessons to be learned and actions to be taken in changing a culture that may have grown up over many years and aspects of those arrangements which we would find unsatisfactory.  From my point of view, it is under a leadership now that will ensure that the culture of public service is manifest and above public reproach in terms of  moderation that is displayed as people go about their business in an appropriate way and are not seen to be extravagant.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Does that mean, for instance, that if Fáilte Ireland brings the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to some function in France or Italy, that it will show up in its report and that of the Department?  Will hospitality extended by an agency to a Minister be made public?  I understand that there is no intention to cover it up but it is necessary that everybody be perfectly aware of it from the reports of the agency and of the Minister's Department.  This should be absolutely above board and everybody should understand it.  One does not want a situation to arise in which someone knows that a Minister was in America or wherever, but the trip is reported only in the accounts of the semi-State agency.  I hope that the structures being put in place under the former Secretary General with responsibility for the public service will ensure that happens.  If a Minister travels at the invitation of a semi-State body or agency to do business for the country, everybody should understand the nature of that travel and a record of it should be available for all to see.  Everybody understands that is what it was, as it is there for all to see.  Will those changed structures bring about that situation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Standards in Public Office Commission, which sets out the code of conduct for officeholders, does not apply the question of filling forms for the supply of a property or a service, made during the course of such a supply for the purpose of the performance of the duties of an officeholder.  The Standards in Public Office Commission has drawn up the guidelines, and we should abide by them.  The office is doing this in compliance with the legislation.  I do not have a problem with whatever guidelines we are asked to comply with.  In this case, the office has indicated its view on the matter and we should deal with the issues that are specific to what the legislation was set up to address, rather than trying to deal with every issue related to the performance of people's duties on a daily basis.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	These questions arose from the controversy that developed following revelations about FÁS involving trips to Florida and the expenses incurred, about who travelled and who paid for what.  It emerged that the statutory responsibility for approving the scheme of expenses rested with the Minister.  Without going back over the detail about who travelled where, we need to first establish a few principles.  It is not a good idea that a Minister, who has a statutory responsibility to approve a scheme of expenses, should himself be the beneficiary of an expenses regime in the State agency concerned.  There needs to be some kind of wall developed between the Minister who approves the regime, and the agency to whom the regime applied.  Where a Minister is invited on a mission of some kind by a State agency, the expenditure incurred by the Minister and his or her staff should be accounted for in the Department's own budget, and should be subject to Dáil questions and the normal parliamentary scrutiny and accountability that applies to that.  If that were done, there would be a distinction between the expenditure of the State agency and the extent to which Ministers benefit.  The important thing is to make that distinction between the accountability by the State agency and the Minister.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I do not know about that, but I will have it checked.  The Department of Finance set out certain guidelines on this.  I think the Deputy raised the matter with me before, when he asked that FÁS submit a scheme of expenses for approval by the Minister, on the basis that it is in compliance with the general guidelines set out by the Department of Finance.  The question of whether the expenses are paid for out of the budget of the State agency or the Minister's own budget is a matter for consideration.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about it.  If a Minister is performing his or duties on behalf of a State agency, usually that agency deals with the travel and other arrangements that are provided for in that trip.  It is not dealt with in different parts by the Department and the agency.I will check whether the current arrangements in place will add to the issue to any great extent.  We are dealing with public money, so accountability should be available from those who disburse it.  If it is disbursed by a State agency, then that agency should answer for it, rather than create another arrangement where some payments are made by the Department and others by the agency.  Why not have greater transparency from the State agency in the first place?

I made specific reference to the Minister for Health and Children, who was accompanied by her spouse in the incident mentioned by Deputy Gilmore.  That trip was under the aegis of FÁS, and we know that there was much controversy in the fall out from the trip, including the personal services expenses paid by the platinum card of Mr. Greg Craig, the director of public affairs at FÁS.  That created much controversy at the time and led to the resignation of the CEO, Mr. Rody Molloy.  Arising out of what some believe is the inappropriate use of the Government jet, I asked the Taoiseach if any new guidelines were to be introduced by him to lay out his expected best practice approach to the use of the jet.  He stated that he did not believe that this was necessary.On the basis of all that was demonstrated by that Florida trip, have any new guidelines for Ministers and Ministers of State been drawn up in order to ensure that best practice applies to gifts, services and other expenditure by the State agencies?  What guarantee have we that what was discovered about the FÁS trip has not been replicated in other situations across other Departments and State agencies?  What level of oversight and scrutiny is currently in place?  Following the exposure of the practices within FÁS that led to the resignation of its CEO, has the Taoiseach taken steps to insist on best practice across the board?  Given what was exposed on the Florida trip, does the Taoiseach accept that there is a culture that needs to be addressed?  Will he address it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Committee of Public Accounts has been discussing this matter for some time with various members of staff from FÁS.  The committee will be making recommendations for consideration, while the interim chief executive has experience that is being brought to bear on the lessons to be learned at the agency.  The legislative basis upon which we operate, such as codes of conduct, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 and so on, are all complied with by Ministers.  It is a matter for State agencies to ensure that the arrangements made are in line with guidelines devised by themselves and approved by the Minister, or in line with the general Department of Finance guidelines that apply to these matters.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I would like to follow up on that.  It may well be that the practices we are discussing are endemic in the private sector.  There is more and more evidence of that.  The difference is that we are talking specifically about the spending of public moneys by the public sector.  The highest standards need to apply in such circumstances.  Does the Taoiseach accept that rather than allowing State agencies to mimic their counterparts in the private sector, we should put in place the highest standards of best practice?  Can he clearly indicate to the wider public, whose money is employed in the abuses to which I have referred, that these practices have been stamped out and will not be tolerated in the future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The essence of accountability is that lessons are learned when breaches take place or difficulties arise.  If people take on board lessons, change can take place.  That is precisely what accountability is about.  It is obvious that like other agencies, FÁS needs to learn lessons from the controversies that have been brought into the public domain.  As I have said, the new head of the agency will ensure that the appropriate standard of public service applies to all its activities, including activities in this area.  We can have every confidence in his capacity and willingness to do that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.Ten freedom of information requests were received in the Department of the Taoiseach in November 2008.  The number of requests received in 2008 as a whole was 83, 64 of which were granted or part granted and ten of which were withdrawn.  There were no records in respect of six requests.  In the other three cases, the records sought were exempt from release.  The table that follows this reply sets out the other figures requested by the Deputies.  All freedom of information applications received by the Department of the Taoiseach are processed by statutorily designated officials in accordance with the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.  In accordance with the Acts, I have no role in processing individual applications.Year2002200320042005200620072008Totals1461424561547183
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I would like to make two comments.  When certain activities in FÁS were being investigated recently, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts obtained more relevant information from the individual freedom of information requests they submitted than from the documentation the semi-State body in question furnished to the committee.  In other words, less information was supplied on foot of requests from the committee to the agency than was obtained on foot of the freedom of information requests submitted by the members of the committee.  Perhaps that justifies the existence of the freedom of information system.  As the overseer of that system, the Taoiseach should ensure that State bodies provide the fullest possible information when freedom of information requests are made.In response to a previous question, the Taoiseach told me that 10,704 freedom of information requests were made to the Office of the Information Commissioner in 2007.  That figure represented a reduction of 42% since 2003.  The number of requests submitted to the Department of the Taoiseach decreased by 50% over the same time, from 142 in 2003 to 71 in 2007.  I do not think people have stopped making requests because they have got all the information they want.  The Tenth Report by the Minister for Finance on Freedom of Information, which was published on 28 October 2008, highlighted the shortfalls in the freedom of information system’s fee structure.  The Information Commission has pointed out that Ireland is one of only two of eight comparable jurisdictions to charge people to make freedom of information appeals.  Ontario charges €16 for an appeal, but Ireland charges €150.  When the Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance, he dismissed the Information Commissioner’s call for a decrease in the fees imposed in respect of freedom of information requests and appeals.  The commissioner has described the fees as being part of a “culture of secrecy”.At a time when everybody is demanding transparency and accountability, does the Taoiseach, who has said we should have fair play, have any plans to reconsider the Information Commissioner's request for a review of the fee structure?  Fine Gael has proposed that a flat fee of €10 should be imposed in respect of requests, reviews and appeals.  We have suggested that appeal fees should be refunded if appeals are successful.  Does the Taoiseach think the Government could give its consent to such a change?  If a person's appeal to the appeals commissioner is granted, surely the appeal fee should be refunded in recognition of that, or as a consequence of it.  Would the Taoiseach agree to that?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The ongoing process of extending the Freedom of Information Acts to public bodies is being undertaken by the Department of Finance.  As Minister for Finance, I oversaw the biggest ever extension of the scope of the Freedom of Information Acts, to a further 137 bodies, in 2006.  More than 520 bodies are now covered by the freedom of information regime.  Just 67 bodies were covered when the original Freedom of Information Act came into operation ten years ago.  I do not think anyone can question our commitment to wider transparency and accountability.  The Department of Finance is making arrangements to extend the scope of the freedom of information scheme to a further group of bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, which is the only body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach that has yet to be included in the scheme.  I expect the Minister for Finance to make an announcement in this regard in due course.I understand there are no plans to review the freedom of information fee structure, which is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the first instance.  The current structure, which was introduced in 2003, provides that a fee of €15 is imposed when a freedom of information request is made.  I contend that the fee is modest when compared with the estimated average administrative cost of processing a freedom of information request, which is €485.  I remind the House that almost 11,000 such requests were made in 2007.  I do not believe anybody would argue that the fee is unreasonable, or that it discourages people from making responsible freedom of information requests.  It is important to point out that no charge is imposed in respect of the time that is taken to examine the records sought with a view to determining whether they may be released.  Equally, no charge is imposed in respect of access to personal information.  The fees charged under the freedom of information scheme have not increased since they were introduced in July 2003.Deputy Kenny referred in particular to the fees that are charged when appeals are made.  I remind him that it costs €75 for an internal appeal and €150 for an appeal to the Office of the Information Commissioner.  Significant reductions may be availed of by medical card holders, who are asked to pay fees of €25 and €50, respectively, for appeals in each category.  Appeals concerning personal information are entirely exempt from the fee structure.  The making of appeals to the Information Commissioner is a quasi-judicial process.  It can take many months to complete the process, as it can entail a considerable amount of work.  The fee that is charged in such circumstances is a fair reflection of the nature of the appeal process and the costs and time involved.  It is important to note that a person who submits an appeal to the Information Commissioner may receive a preliminary decision, which gives a good indication of the likely final decision.  Such a person can withdraw his or her appeal and obtain a full refund of fees even at that late stage in the process.  I understand that 30% of appeals made to the Office of the Information Commissioner are withdrawn.  The appeal fee is returned in such cases.

The Taoiseach told me on that occasion, in October 2008, that it was intended to appeal the decision in line with advice that had been received from the Attorney General.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House if the decision in question has been appealed?  If so, at what stage is the appeal?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I do not know.  I will have to check it out.  Does the matter in question relate to the Department of the Taoiseach?

The Freedom of Information Commissioner considered that European Union access to information rules and regulations, including access to environmental information, required that it should be released.  The Taoiseach told me at the time that following consultation with the Attorney General's office it had been decided that an appeal should be taken in that case.  If he does not know the answer to that question now, I am sure he will communicate it to me in due course.

In the context of all that has taken place, does he consider it is appropriate to revisit the Information Commissioner's recommendation and to set aside fees to strengthen scrutiny across the broad?  Does he accept it is the absence of scrutiny that has given rise to much of what we have witnessed and learned, including this morning and sadly, into the future?Does the Taoiseach also accept that, aside from FOI legislation and the bodies to which it applies, there is a good argument for him to consider a parallel process that would apply to the corporate sector in order that a light can be shone on the conduct, management and standards applying within it in context of the abject failure of the Office of the Financial Regulator to properly give oversight and scrutiny to that sector?  Is there now a case for the Taoiseach to consider a further measure that would apply not only to public bodies but to the corporate sector to try to offset the serious lack of confidence and strong distrust within Irish society in regard to that sector?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	124	In my previous reply to Deputy Kenny on the fees structure I made the point that it is in no way the deterrent some contend it is for the use of Freedom of Information for the purpose of obtaining information.  The fees structure is very reasonable in the circumstances, given the nature of the work that is undertaken and the fact that the fee does not even come close to the cost of such information being gathered and collated.  In all the circumstances, particularly the full exemption for personal information, the fees structure ensures that presumably, only responsible FOI requests would be pursued rather than people seeking information for the sake of it, putting the system to the trouble of responding only to have it forgotten, with the result that it would not be put to any great public effect.Regarding the question of the regulatory situation in financial services and banking, all of that is now being considered and reviewed in the European context as well as domestically.  We will work with colleagues to examine if the EU-wide regulatory regime is sufficient to meet the new circumstances in which we now find ourselves as a result of the fracture that has taken place in the financial services industry arising from the level of financial innovation that was being conducted, the number of off-balance sheet instruments that were being used and the leveraging of banking assets for the purpose of providing credit, which has led to a crisis of confidence in terms of credit being less available and the banking system being under stress worldwide.  Domestically, the Minister for Finance will examine what arrangements he considers should now be proposed to the Government for consideration in respect of new regulatory arrangements that will ensure public confidence can be applied to the oversight and supervision of the financial services industry in Ireland.

Will he accept it is unfortunate that the argument of vexatious FOIs is used to scuttle any reconsideration of the Information Commissioner's recommendation to abolish fees?  In that context, is there not a mechanism that could be introduced for an independent determination as to vexatious as against sincere and serious FOIs?  Does he not consider that the Information Commissioner's recommendation in this regard still has merit?  By contrast with other jurisdictions, the punitive costs involved in the appeals process here constitutes a serious disincentive.  Surely that merits reconsideration in the context of all that we have spoken about.Will the Taoiseach indicate what recommendations, arising out of the experience of the inadequacy of the Financial Regulator, he and his Government are presenting in the European context for broader consideration and application?  I hope this will be done at the earliest possible time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I do not accept that the fees structure is punitive.  The Deputy does not seem to have any evidence to suggest it is punitive.  As I said, the fee for medical card holders is €35 and €50.  This is in regard to quasi-judicial procedures.  One could not go into a court with a lawyer and expect to get anything done for €20 or €50.  Having regard to the amount of time being applied to provide this information, the appeal mechanism of the Information Commissioner and the fact that it takes months to address issues, to suggest that the fees structure is a deterrent or a disincentive is not borne out by the facts.  Perhaps it has helped in reducing the number of vexatious Freedom of Information requests being submitted.   If there is no fees structure in place, one would make it up as one goes along and keep the whole system going trying to collect information simply because somebody seems to want it rather than it being sought for any obvious effect.  We must be sensible about this.  I believe the balance is very well struck.On the question of co-ordination and the question of to what extent EU-wide regulatory rules can be applied, that matter is being discussed by ECOFIN and Finance Ministers on an ongoing basis, as are proposals by the Commission, in which Commissioner McCreevy is involved.  It is a question of waiting to see what emerges from that, but there is no doubt there is a broader context than simply our own regulatory context — there is a wider issue that must be addressed.  This is an international industry and there is a strong movement of capital all over the world.  We must have some rules and regulations by which people need to work to ensure there is greater transparency and understanding of what is going on.

I took the opportunity to stress the importance the Government attaches to Ireland's relationship with the United States.  He expressed his desire that the relationship would continue to flourish in the coming years.I commented on my visit to New York last summer.  Ours is a mature two-way relationship and I fully expect it to further develop on that basis.  I briefed the President-elect on the positive political developments in Northern Ireland with the resumption of meetings of the Northern Ireland Executive.  I took the opportunity to personally invite him to Ireland.  I also wrote to him on 20 January to convey my best wishes on his inauguration.I expect to visit the United States in March for St. Patrick's Day.  While the programme for my visit has not yet been finalised, I would expect to meet with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board.  My Department maintains contact with the board primarily through the Irish Embassy in Washington, as well as through visits and meetings.

Is it his hope that the US Government will introduce a comprehensive Bill within 12 to 18 months or does he envisage that the Minister for Foreign Affairs might have to make arrangements, if possible, for a bilateral arrangement with the US, given that former Senator Clinton is now the Secretary of State?My third question concerns the role of the special envoy to Northern Ireland, an appointment made originally by President Clinton.  This is an important position in keeping connections and contacts alive between Northern Ireland, Ireland and the United States.  Prior to the US presidential election there were some suggestions that the special envoy might be recalled.  Did the Taoiseach mention to President Obama the importance of maintaining this position?  If so, did the President make any comment?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Paula Dobriansky was the latest nominee of President Bush and she is returning to other duties.  I understand  the Obama Administration intends to continue with such an arrangement whereby a person from the State Department will continue to engage his or her capacities with the process and be helpful in every way possible in terms of confidence building and  bringing his or her particular perspective, especially an economic one, to the question of the process and how he or she can help things along.  We very much thank all those who have been appointed by previous US Presidents and we look forward to the new appointment and to having a positive working arrangement with the person appointed.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, will engage most often with the appointee.On finding a solution for undocumented citizens, supporting our diaspora and addressing the plight of the undocumented in the United States are key objectives of the Government.  Finding a resolution for our undocumented community is an important priority for us.  We have pursued a bilateral solution to reforming our migration arrangements with the United States.  This strategy has three key objectives — the solution for our undocumented; the establishment of a new long-term reciprocal working visa system known as the E3; and the working holiday agreement.  A new working holiday agreement between the two countries has now been achieved.  Detailed discussions are being held with senior members of Congress in respect of the second issue.However, finding a solution for the undocumented remains our key priority in this area.  In taking up the issue with the new US Administration and with Congress we are building on the extensive work on behalf of the undocumented the Government has carried out over recent years with many of those now within the Administration, and in co-operation with the Irish lobby for immigration reform.  Since 2006, the Government has provided funding of $235,000 for this work.

Is he hopeful?  Does he expect to have a meaningful engagement with the President and to have the opportunity to address, in a serious and focused way, the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States?  All sides of this House share concern on this issue.  There is a critical need to start ratcheting up pressure with regard to this matter.  It drifted during the former President's terms and this has caused huge hurt and anguish for Irish people in the United States, and for their families here.  I presume we are all conscious of this.In the context of President Obama's day one announcement in respect of Guantanamo and all matters emanating from that, during the course of his telephone conversation did the Taoiseach address the issue of extraordinary rendition and how it has applied in Ireland, and, specifically, at Shannon Airport?  Will he address the issue in the course of an upcoming engagement with the US President in the context of his stated intent? Will we now see a new regime of inspection agreed to between the US Administration and Ireland?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I will try to keep the US President out of GAA politics.  Deputy Ó Caoláin raised several matters.  These are substantive meetings and any suggestion to the contrary is rather ungracious.  The Deputy's party has been a beneficiary of the process for a long time and, but for the fact that Irish Governments were able to get into such places, his party members might not have been able to make the visits they have made in recent times.  The Government has had an excellent relationship with all US Administrations and these have brought real and direct benefits.  They have been instrumental in insuring that political developments can take place.  That level of engagement continues.  I have no reason to doubt that President Obama will not be seized by some of these issues given his very wide and burdensome duties and obligations.  There is no doubt that Ireland has enjoyed a level of interest from successive Administrations, indicative of the very close ties of kinship we have enjoyed with that country over many years.The question of the undocumented is one that must be handled appropriately and in a way that might achieve progress for us.  It is easy, as the Deputy might claim, to ratchet up pressure.  Ratcheting up presure is not in itself the issue.  There are many people of goodwill in the Houses of Congress who will be supportive in the right circumstances.  Those circumstances have yet to be created because there are many countries with a diaspora and there are, therefore, many people of different origins who also have this problem.  It has caused very serious domestic difficulty for many in Congress, and in the context of political debate over many years.Rather than believing we must go in and start twisting arms all over the place, what we must do is build on the goodwill we have generated on this issue.  We must be respectful of the fact that it is a difficult domestic question for the United States.  It is one on which we are prepared to engage with that country, find incremental improvements, and try to deal with this issue.  That means being mindful of the difficulties it creates rather than believing there is an entitlement we can expect.  The approach must be sensible and sensitive to the domestic realities for both parties represented.That, in no way, is to suggest we are not very determined to assist those who find themselves in this difficulty.  As constituency Deputies we know of many who hold this status who wish to have it rectified as soon as possible.  Their position denies them return to their own country and their loved ones.  They miss many important occasions in family life, whether weddings, bereavements or suchlike, quite apart from the fact they cannot come home and socialise in their own country.  This is a very human issue and is one with which I am especially acquainted.  I wish to address it but I must approach it, as we all must, on the basis there are people who can and will assist, given the right circumstances.  It is our job to try to create those circumstances and not to make an approach that would detract from establishing sufficient goodwill to make a decision possible.There is no relenting by this Administration.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has been assiduous in the conduct of his duties in this regard, given the high priority it is accorded in his Department, apart from the important aspect of our bilateral relationship it represents as an outstanding item to be resolved.  On the basis that Guantanamo Bay is closing, I do not see the purpose of an inspection regime.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I am concerned about social solidarity and good faith.  On 29 September, the members of the Government met regarding the bank guarantee scheme and 30 September was the year end date for Anglo Irish Bank.  In January, we dealt with the nationalisation of Anglo Irish bank.  An issue of considerable importance in that Bill was the Government's knowledge that €7 billion had been passed from Irish Life & Permanent to Anglo Irish Bank.  That was an important piece of information of which the Dáil should have been aware in the context of its deliberations on that Bill because, through nationalisation, the country is being asked to take an exposure of the order of tens of billions of euro in potentially bad debts.  While I am loath to accuse anybody of misleading the House, obviously the Government, Taoiseach and Minister for Finance were aware of this.  We should have a two-hour debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I am making it to the Government through you, Sir.  You constantly remind  me to talk to you.  I propose that at the close of normal business we have 90 minutes of discussion on this matter to clear up any misconceptions.  The Government was aware of this transfer of €7 billion.  I am concerned about the misrepresentation of the use of that money as a loan or as a deposit and the Taoiseach should come into the House——

We do not know what decision he will make on the private notice questions.  I propose a 90-minute debate at the end of business so the Taoiseach can give an explanation to the House of the circumstances surrounding——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	191	——the transfer of €7 billion to Anglo Irish Bank, which is the same amount the Government proposes to take from the taxpayer to fund the recapitalisation programme.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I support Deputy Kenny's request.  I appreciate what the Ceann Comhairle said about the normal procedures that apply in the House.  However, the Taoiseach's response to my question earlier this morning was extraordinary.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that he and the Government knew about the €7 billion transfer of money or loan — call it what one wants —  to Anglo Irish Bank, the effect of which was to falsify the real position of that bank.  The Government knew about that before it introduced legislation in the House asking us to nationalise that bank and take responsibility for it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	That is correct.  The Government did not tell us.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	197	We were not told.  The Government introduced legislation on an entirely false premise.  It had very substantial information which affected the status of Anglo Irish Bank and what we took on when we nationalised it, and the Government did not inform us about it.  It is not a small matter.  The consequences of all this for the public finances, the country, the taxpayer, jobs, business and our economy are enormous.  I support Deputy Kenny's request that the basis on which the Bill to nationalise the bank was introduced in the House be debated here.  The information provided to the House was certainly false.  At the very least, the Government held back information it should have provided to us.

He was asking us to sign up to the expenditure of public moneys and the exposure of the public finances to what I described as potentially a financial cesspit.  That is exactly as it has proven to be.  If the Minister had not proceeded as he did, after yesterday's exposure about Irish Life & Permanent the ass would have fallen out of Anglo Irish Bank and it would not be worth a button on the Stock Exchange this morning.  That is a fact.  It would be over and done with.  Many people watching the situation would say today "Good riddance".  There are strong opinions on this matter.  The Minister for Finance was unable to give that assurance.  He looked ashen-faced across the House in response to that and other questions posed.  He clearly had critical information, and he had either personally decided to withhold it or had been gagged and prevented from sharing it with other Members of the House.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Come on now.  I must ask the Taoiseach to respond.

This is not only about Anglo Irish Bank.  It is about Irish Nationwide and Mr. FitzPatrick.  It is about Irish Life & Permanent——

The big questions are why the Financial Regulator was unable to come clean on these matters, and what was the extent of his knowledge, and that of his office, about these matters.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It is important that we deal with these issues in a sensible and moderate fashion.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Government intends to conduct a meeting today with regard to recapitalisation of two of the main institutions.  This would involve a debate in the House tomorrow for that purpose.  All these matters can be discussed and clarified without any problem whatever.  The point that was being made during Leaders' Questions was that there were governance issues arising with regard to Anglo Irish Bank and this was sapping market confidence.  On my official trip to Japan I indicated through conversations I had that it was clear that nationalisation of the bank was required and that this was in the public interest.  That was the decision that was taken in the public interest.  There was no attempt by anybody to mislead or do anything untoward whatsoever, as far as we are concerned, with regard to these matters.  The debate in the House on foot of the decision to be taken by Government later will be the best way of clarifying this.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	222	What is in the interest of the country's reputation is that we proceed with our recapitalisation in order to stabilise the banking system, and for the debate to take place in this House on all aspects of the matter.  It is open to anyone in the House to raise any issue.For the purpose of clarification, I want to make the point again that general governance issues were arising with regard to Anglo Irish Bank which brought about a situation in which the nationalisation of the bank was imperative.  There was no detail available to me at that time about specific matters.  What we were talking about was governance issues which were sapping market confidence.  We needed to deal with that issue and that was the basis upon which we made those decisions.

This House showed before, in the DIRT inquiry, that it has the capacity to examine these issues and make recommendations about future conduct.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that seriously.  I cannot see any downside to it.  The people expect no less of us.

The issue at stake here is that the Government came in and asked the House to pass a Bill nationalising a bank whose accounts had been effectively falsified by the loans it got from other institutions.  The Government knew that at the time it brought in the legislation.

We were asked to nationalise a bank while the Government knew that the real financial position of that bank was not as had been publicly stated.

It is my understanding and experience in this House over many years that when Members either intentionally or by accident say something that misleads the House, they come into the House and explain themselves.  This morning, on this particular issue, the Taoiseach has said two things which are mutually contradictory.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I cannot go into that now.

Does it intend to have a debate on that issue in the House and when might that debate take place?  On a second matter, an old chestnut, could the Taoiseach indicate when the Bill to regulate management companies will be published?

You might concede on the first question and that would clear up this entire matter, but I do not wish to pre-empt your decision.  The Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act or EPSEN Act passed by the Oireachtas gave absolute rights and guarantees to special needs children in primary and post-primary school.  Can the Taoiseach advise the House if the Minister for Education and Science had the full support of the National Council for Special Education before his decision to effectively get rid of 128 teachers for special needs children from 1 September next?  Would the Taoiseach not accept that an amendment to the EPSEN Act is required for the Minister to do this?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance make a statement in the House?  At the time of the banks guarantee — and on the occasion of each of the four other major debates relating to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the recapitalisation announcement — I asked them whether they were aware that 30 September was the final year end accounting date of Anglo Irish Bank and what impact that had on the decision of the Government to bring forward the guarantee scheme.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	331	This is a conspiracy by the Government to save Anglo Irish Bank at the expense of the general Irish banking system.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	333	It is a wrong conspiracy.  You should come to the House and address what you told the House when you misled the House, Minister.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	335	There are two Bills promised.  The first is the financial services (deposit guarantee scheme) Bill.  How can the Government proceed with that Bill in the context of what we now know about what the Government knew about the guarantee and the circumstances in Anglo Irish Bank but refused to tell this House when it introduced the guarantee on 29 September?  The second Bill is the National Pensions Reserve Fund (Amendment) Bill.  How can that Bill be introduced when we know that the proposal to put €7.5 billion into the two big banks is seriously and dangerously flawed because of behind the scenes deals between this Government and Anglo Irish Bank?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	336	Once again, I totally refute that statement.  It is totally inaccurate and wrong.  It is just not true and it does not become this House to continue making those allegations.  They are not true, and I ask the Deputy to accept that.  Everything we are doing here and everything we are trying to do to contend with the situation is in the public interest.  To continue with such innuendo adds nothing to the debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	337	To ask us to believe, Taoiseach, that you did not know suggests that you are incompetent, and so is the Minister.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	340	It suggests that the Taoiseach is incompetent beyond belief.

That is what he is accused of.

There are currently four investigations running in Anglo Irish Bank.  Will he appoint an inspector of the High Court?  That is required to clear it out and restore our reputation.

Deputy Stagg raised the issue of estate management companies.  The Taoiseach did not clarify the matter but only said it is ongoing.  However, when I asked the Tánaiste about it I was told a single Bill was being introduced.

The Minister for Education and Science has created a reputation by portraying himself as the Rocky V of the Government.  It is easy to be Rocky when one is taking on vulnerable children with disabilities.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Before we begin I wish to bring to the attention of Members that the original list of amendments circulated on 18 December 2008 should not be used.  All amendments to be considered are on the substitute list of amendments circulated on 3 February and the additional list circulated on 9 February.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Before we start to discuss the specific amendments before the House today, I briefly want to clarify for Members why I am returning to the House with more than 80 amendments to the Bill as originally passed by the House in last November.The amendments fall into a number of categories and a good proportion of them are presentational, drafting and technical type amendments on the advice of Parliamentary Counsel.There are a number of substantive amendments and a number of those emerged from issues raised by Members across the floor of both this House and the Seanad.  I gave a commitment at that stage that we would address issues such as mass cards and Daffodil Day.It has always been my approach to listen to the issues raised during the debates, irrespective of from which side of the House they emanated, and to take on board the positive suggestions where possible.  As I stated, many of the amendments before the House today have emerged from Opposition amendments in both Houses and I thank all Members of both Houses for their constructive input to the Bill since its introduction.  As a direct result and a consequence of this inclusive approach, I believe we now have a much improved Bill.  Changes made to the Bill in the Seanad have been broadly welcomed by the sector and it is telling that none of the amendments before the Dáil today was opposed in the Seanad.   I look forward to outlining these amendments to the Members and I shall now turn to the specific ones.Amendments Nos. 1, 5, 40 and 46 were added during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad on foot of discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General.  As it stands, education bodies such as schools, student councils, parent associations and vocational educational committees are already subject to oversight by the Department of Education and Science, and on occasion by other bodies such as the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is not the intention of the Charities Bill to impose a significant additional administrative burden on organisations, and yet the principle is that all charities must be entered on the register of charities, including education bodies referred to here.However, these amendments will exempt education bodies from the need to submit annual reports and the annual audit examination of accounts provisions.  Education bodies, however, which are not charities, should not and will not be exempted from the need to keep books of accounts.  It is important that charities should be able to accurately account for their financial situation at all times.  I consider the exemption from some of these accounting and auditing requirements was appropriate as many of these education bodies are already required to keep and submit accounts to other sources.  It will, of course, still be within the gift of the authority to request any information from these bodies, where necessary.In keeping with the graduated approach to regulation, I also considered that there is merit to easing the regulating burden on charities that are extremely small, with limited resources.  Accordingly, in the case of such charities with an income or expenditure of less than €10,000 per annum, I am providing that they be exempted from the accounts and audit or examination provisions of the Bill.  There is scope for this threshold to be increased to up to €50,000, if considered appropriate, over time.  I believe it would be unreasonable to expect a charity of that scale to provide examined accounts, although as with education bodies they will be required to produce an annual report, which may also contain financial information.  Members should bear in mind that the authority is empowered to request information from any charity, including the small charities and the education bodies, as appropriate.  To achieve this outcome a number of amendments were required.Amendment No. 1 clarifies that "the Act of 1998" refers to the Education Act 1998.  Amendment No. 5 defines an "education body" for the purposes of the Bill.  Amendment No. 40 exempts both education bodies and small charities from the requirement to submit an annual statement of accounts to the new authority, while amendment No. 46 exempts the same organisations from the audit and examination provisions.   I believe these amendment strike an appropriate balance and provide fair and equitable oversight, and I move the amendments.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	476	As a matter of procedure, because these are Seanad amendments, they must be proposed from the Chair.  I now propose Seanad amendment No. 1, which is related to Seanad amendments Nos. 5, 40 and 46.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 1, 5, 40 and 46 may be discussed together.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I welcome the Bill in principle.  The Minister of State accepted some of our amendments and introduced the necessary legislation in the Seanad, and I welcome that.  I am disappointed that he has not dealt with one area in the Bill, however, in relation to human rights as a charitable purpose.  I have received much representation in this regard, as has my colleague, Deputy Wall, and other Members of the House.  We are concerned that these charities will be disadvantaged vis-à-vis the UK and Europe.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not introduce the necessary amendment to deal with this in the Seanad.  There is concern among charities about this as evidenced by the representations I have received.  I asking the Minister of State whether something could be done, even at this late stage, to try to reassure these charities and table the necessary amendments to deal with the problem they have. Regarding amendment No. 1 and the other amendments in relation to smaller charities, I welcome the proposal because I believe many such charities would have had to present audited accounts at the end of the year.  The Minister of State seems to be saying that if a charity is getting up to €10,000, it will be recognised as a charity and will not have to present audited accounts.  For charities with incomes above €10,000, the regulator can exercise discretion in relation to the amount of paperwork they have to produce.  I welcome that and believe it is in the spirit of the Bill.  The one item we all sought in this Bill was that there should not be too much bureaucracy and paperwork for charities.  They collect money that the State will not provide and we do not want charities spending more time than they should producing paperwork for the regulator.  I accept the amendment as a good proposal and Fine Gael will not oppose it.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I also thank the Minister of State for the changes he has made.  Obviously, it is good to note that some of the amendments, as proposed in this House, have been included.The issue of human rights has again raised its head on foot of representations from various groups such as Amnesty International, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Frontline, Wheel, etc.  They have all raised major concerns about this and some aspects of the Bill in relation to those charities that already have a human rights dimension to them.  The fear is that this could cause concerns when sections of the Bill are reviewed in five years' time.I also appeal to the Minister of State in this regard.  Given the enormous implications for human rights, is it not feasible that something might be done to address this shortfall in the Bill?  The perspective on this side of the House is that the Minister of State is open to change, given his approach to the legislation both in this House and in the Seanad.  The freedom of debate on the Bill must be acknowledged.  The Minister of State's officials were readily available to us and he demonstrated real transparency on the various amendments tabled by the Opposition and in trying to facilitate Members.  However, the human rights aspect is the Bill's single shortfall.  I ask him to consider amending it in that regard.Among the representations we received was a proposal from the Law Society, which was circulated to the various organisations.  There is, therefore, a general concern in this regard.  It would be wonderful if this provision could be included, as it was in the original Bill.  At that stage there was great relief that the Bill, as proposed, would eventually deliver what had been sought, since so many people had lobbied for a charities Bill for so long.  The fact that this provision was included in the original draft was seen as the icing on the cake.  In agreeing with the amendments being discussed, I want to raise this concern, and I am aware that Deputies Costello and Higgins also have major reservations about this aspect of the Bill.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Like the previous two speakers, I welcomed this Bill when it was first drafted and we saw the heads.  The main omission, which I presumed was a clerical error when it was first printed, was the admission that the advancement of human rights was a charitable purpose.  I appeal to the Minister of State at this, the eleventh hour, to include the advancement of human rights in the Bill as a charitable purpose.  I presume that we could, if so desired, recommit to deal with that omission.  It is a serious omission because in other jurisdictions it is a given that the advancement of human rights is a charitable purpose.The principle of equivalence which lies behind the Good Friday Agreement and which has directed much of our legislation in this area will be undermined because human rights advocacy is afforded charitable status in the North.  Even though existing human rights NGOs will be protected, organisations established in the future to protect human rights will not be afforded charitable status.  In addition, existing NGOs will encounter greater difficulties in raising funds because they will not meet the criteria set out in the legislation.The Minister of State would not wish to be associated with a systematic and concerted assault on the human rights architecture of this State but the removal from the Bill of human rights advancement as a charitable purpose is seen by all who work in the field, and by many others, as part of just such an assault.  Budget 2009 provided further glaring examples of this assault with the imposition on the Human Rights Commission of a 24% cut in funding and the slashing of the Equality Authority's budget by an incredible 42%.  Rather than forcing the passage of this Bill and promising to address the issue at a later stage, I appeal to the Minister of State to delay its enactment in order to find a mechanism for fixing this major shortfall.  Otherwise, my colleagues and I will probably have to oppose a Bill which has been welcomed for the most part.  The attitude of the Minister of State and his officials to Opposition proposals has been quite positive thus far and they will have one more chance to address this issue by making changes to the amendments which we will discuss presently.  We are happy to support the amendments currently before us, however.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I support the voices that have urged the Minister of State to reconsider his decision on excluding human rights as a charitable purpose.  We are in the unusual situation of seeking to reinstate provisions which were contained in the Bill as originally drafted.  These provisions were not removed at the request of any Opposition Deputy but by the very Minister of State who has responsibility for the Bill in the first place.  I ask him to clarify how he can include human rights bodies within the definition of charitable organisations but subsequently remove them without explanation.Like my colleagues and I, he has probably received submissions from Amnesty, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Front Line, the Wheel and the Law Society.  Apart from the Law Society, these are non-governmental organisations concerned with the advancement and protection of human rights nationally and internationally.  This provision would be a severe setback for those organisations which have hitherto enjoyed charitable status.  To make matters even worse, we are specifically excluding them from the legislation.  That is a slap in the face to these organisations and their work on human rights.The Minister of State also has responsibility for combatting drugs.  He is doing a fine job in this regard and is well respected in the community that I represent.  However, he should recognise the relationship between the scourge of drugs and the promotion of human rights and equality.  It is important to have effective community based non-governmental organisations if we are to improve the quality of life from a human rights perspective.I can see no apparent reason for denying charitable status to these bodies.  They need such status to continue their activities as voluntary organisations.  It is eminently reasonable, therefore, to allow them to continue as charities.This country has recently witnessed a number of attacks on human rights and their promotion.  The economic recession has carried over into that arena.  We can see the effects on the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission and overseas aid, much of which is spent on the promotion of human rights.  Our domestic legislation should reflect our appreciation of human rights both at home and abroad.  In terms of the monetary returns of voluntary organisations, charitable status is essential.I ask the Minister of State to explain why human rights advocacy was first included then removed from the Bill's provisions on charitable status.  Has he entered into discussions with the human rights bodies to which I referred earlier?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	481	This is a very important issue.  As I have noted in previous debates during the Bill's passage through this House, we have to be careful in ensuring that life is not made more difficult for existing organisations or impossible for new organisations in terms of extending their remits or operating in a practical sense on the ground.The argument will be made that human rights are not excluded from the Bill's provisions because, for example, the welfare of a community could be defined at some stage in the future as potentially including human rights.  That is not good enough because any discussion that arises in the future will be influenced by the fact that human rights were specifically excluded.  This will represent a serious hindrance.  If such a consideration applied in respect of an application to the Revenue Commissioners for charitable status, an organisation would immediately run into potentially disastrous difficulties.  I want to be positive about the matter and I do not impute any ill-will to the Minister of State.The obvious way out of this is to find a mechanism for inclusion of an explicit reference that the promotion and protection of civil and human rights is a charitable purpose.  This must be done.  Enormous work has gone into, for example, the development of the new United Nations Convention on Disability, the former thrust of which — it includes contributions from people such as Professor Ger Quinn and others — was to enable the disability issue evolve into a rights context.The issue is whether one purports to be charitable towards an unfortunate person one manages to find a means of assisting or whether one views that person's right to participate fully as a citizen.  Participation is mentioned in relation to means.  However, the drift in terms of jurisprudence in this area is towards an explicit recognition of a right.  This is happening nationally, in European terms and at United Nations level.  An enormous amount of work has gone into this.  Equally, in regard to the development theory, with which I am more familiar, the Irish White Paper to its credit makes reference to the human rights component of its development strategy.  The Norwegians regarded as most important that it have a rights focus as part of its white paper on development.As regards practise on the ground, those of us who have done so know that when one walks into an area of huge deprivation by which one is deeply saddened, one's concern is to be of assistance rather than to address the fundamental issue.  Practical examples are important.  During our earlier discussions on the Bill I expressed concern in regard to the exclusion of political purpose.  Looked at historically, this would have excluded the campaign in the British Parliament for the abolition of trade in slaves and in today's terms would exclude the admirable work by some of our NGOs in making cases against child or bonded labour.  Is such campaign political?  It is, at least, human rights.Recognition of civil and political rights was not the strongest possible position to take.  The strongest possible position would have been that suggested by me during the Second Stage debate, namely, not to include an interpretation that excluded people opposing, say, a dictatorship.  I admire organisations that undertake works of justice.I have been a Member of this House for a long time and have witnessed clear division in this House between those who suggest it is all right for us to be involved in charitable acts and those who believe it is not appropriate for us to be involved in making the case for justice, an issue I came across while campaigning on issues in Central America in respect of El Salvador and Nicaragua and in regard to the Chilean dictatorship of Pinochet and so on.  I regard as sad that we would ever do anything that would interfere with the capacity and charitable status of organisations engaged in tasks of justice, including the Mothers of the Disappeared in Chile and in Argentina and so forth.  Even if I accepted the view that we must exclude people involved in activities that could be construed as political we would be doing something much more serious if we provided that the whole purpose of activity of an NGO or any other civil organisation can be the advancement of human rights.I stated earlier that this is not the strongest but the minimalist campaigning position, which is precisely the reason the human rights committee of the Law Society of Ireland, which is not a radical organisation, has put forward its particular proposal in regard to management of the issue.  It suggests that because the word "means" is included in the legislation the suggestion could be made that one could seek to satisfy the advancement of human rights under another condition at a later stage.The function of parliamentarians is to deal with the quality of legislation.  It is not satisfactory to state one agrees with everything said but that the matter can be dealt with another day.  This could create practical difficulties for existing NGOs and others in terms of their dealings with, among others, the Revenue Commissioners and could create a boundary for new and emerging concentrations.  While I am an adjunct professor of the Irish Centre for Human Rights, the views I have expressed are my own.  I simply wish to declare my connection with a human rights organisation.The unanimous scholarly view in regard to legislation of this type is that it is best to be explicit.  Inclusion of protection and promotion of civil and human rights does not lessen legislation but provides for protections, accountability and transparency.  One should not leave dealing with this issue to another day as this would require those performing these important and worthwhile tasks to seek to be accommodated within some other parts of the definition.  I urge the Minister of State — there is no suggestion of a partisan difference between us on this — to seek to accommodate this issue on the basis of good legislation, practise and management.

However, as the issue has been raised by many speakers, I would like to address it.To be fair, the issue of human rights has received considerable debate at different Stages in this and the other House.  I reiterate that "charitable purposes" as provided for in section 3 mirror those changes developed in common law over many years and used by the Revenue Commissioners in considering eligibility for exemptions.As I stated previously, the Bill neither seeks to dilute nor expand these "charitable purposes".  I admit the term "human rights" is not specifically stated in the Bill.  However, many of the purposes listed as "charitable purposes" are the activities in which human rights groups engage, including the prevention or relief of poverty, the advancement of education, the advancement of conflict resolution and reconciliation, the prevention of human suffering and the integration of those disadvantaged in society.  These specific purposes are identified in the Bill.I disagree with Deputy Higgins' statement that organisations not registered with the new regulatory authority may encounter difficulties with Revenue.  The Bill is explicit in this regard.  There is a clear divide in responsibility.  The Revenue Commissioners are independent in their own findings.  The Bill provides that those charities currently registered with Revenue will be deemed to be charitable under the new legislation and authority.  I do not believe any existing human rights group will be affected by this.  The purposes identified are the activities in which human rights groups engage.  As I stated earlier and have reiterated time and again, the purpose of this legislation was to maintain the status quo and to regulate what is currently happening.  Also, provision is made for a mandatory review of the legislation in five years.On Deputy Ring's comment regarding small charities, I agree it is important that the amount of regulation introduced is proportionate.  Lest anybody believe small charities can come and go and do as they wish, while the new regulatory authority will have the power to seek any and all information provision is not made for complicated returns.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Universities undertake their take-up collections inside and outside the country.  The Bill suggests that while they will not be exempt, what they collect will not be published.  I want to ensure they are monitored like everybody else and that when donations are made for a university, everything is above board.  I hope the Department of Education and Science will ensure that will be the case if this aspect is not covered by this legislation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I accept the Minister of State's point that the status quo will be respected in terms of charitable status.  However, it is still beyond me why he is not prepared to accept a wording that provides specifically for the promotion and advancement of human and civil rights.  Any of the areas that are covered do not cover the entire gamut of civil and human rights.  There are organisations specifically dedicated to human rights.  Amnesty International is one such organisation but its remit is not covered by the terms of this legislation.The Minister of State says the status quo will not be interfered with but why not allow a wording that clearly underpins our commitment as a country to the promotion and advancement of human and civil rights?  We are very strong in this regard on a domestic and an international basis, and we pride ourselves on having been to the forefront with the United Nations and the Council of Europe when they were established.  We were also a founding member of Amnesty International when it was established for the promotion and advancement of human and civil rights.Why not have it contained in the Bill?  It is not doing any damage to the wording but it would do a lot of good and would reassure these organisations that their work is being respected by the authorities and the Members of this House.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Deputy is correct that the purpose of the Bill is to maintain the status quo.  As at present with regard to the Revenue Commissioners, human rights per se is not recognised as a charitable purpose yet organisations like Amnesty International are registered and will automatically be deemed to be registered with the new authority.The central point is that this legislation was drawn up to mirror and maintain the status quo.  I am conscious of the fact that this in itself was a substantial piece of work.  There is the second aspect that there would be a mandatory review within five years because there is a very significant job to do.To return to the point made by Deputy Ring on education, it is not that those bodies are not reporting to the charity authority but that they are reporting to other authorities and some of them may even be accountable to bodies like the Committee of Public Accounts.  Even with that in mind, the authority is still entitled to request any additional information it may subsequently deem appropriate.  However, those educational institutions, because they are already reporting, will not have an onus to have those accounts published with the authority.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I wish to add one further point which I believe is important.  My difficulty with the Bill when I spoke on Second Stage was in regard to the suggestion that it is simply addressed to dealing with the status quo.  We have waited a long time for legislation and it represents a monumental amount of work to actually deal with the status quo. However, if we are to have a review in five years’ time or otherwise, it would be irresponsible of me not to say that the former thrust of legislation in this area, comparatively and internationally, as well as practice on the ground, is towards the recognition of a rights approach.One could argue that 1993 was the high point, given the first appointment of a United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights.  One could also argue that the last decade, the last five years in particular, has seen a retreat from the rights perspective internationally, so the amendment would be a very good thing.  The most progressive NGOs are expressing their interest and wish to operate on a rights basis.A further international development is the merging of civil and political rights with economic, social and cultural rights.  This is part of the forward movement of progressive movements of landholders and peasants in other parts of the world.  It would have been better in many cases to have the inclusion of a simple, straightforward recognition.  This would mean that the legislation is not out of date and is in the forward spirit of the forward movement of thinking on this issue.It will happen anyway — it will have to happen.  However, the point is that we should not have a needless legalistic argument with regard to rights having to justify themselves in regard to community welfare, which will immediately encounter the old argument that used to apply with regard to pensions and welfare as to whether the issue was residual, structural or otherwise.  We have been through all of that nearly 100 years ago in arguing about the British welfare state.  Exactly the same argument will now arise in this regard.  It is also included in regard to the question of benefit to the community and so on.  Why would one have to plan for the rights perspective to come in the back door when there is the whole structure of forward thinking in this area?One can do everything one likes for the status quo.  I want to recognise the achievement in terms of drafting in this highly technical area.  However, acceptance of the amendment will save time in the future in terms of amending the legislation and review.  The Minister of State should consider how the accommodation of five or six words will represent so much possibility for people who are interested in the area.

I inherited the Bill in the course of its passage through the Oireachtas and two of my predecessors as Minister of State, Deputies Pat Carey and Noel Ahern, dealt with the earlier Stages.  The underlying issue was that while this is complex, we are trying to maintain the status quo.  We are considering what Revenue has done.  It was in that context that the legislation was framed.The Bill seeks to ensure that existing groups involved in human rights and social justice issues, and which are currently registered as charities, will automatically be deemed as charities.  I reiterate that when we consider charitable purposes, all of the specific purposes in which human rights groups are currently in engaged, such as the prevention or relief of poverty, the advancement of education and the advancement of conflict resolution and reconciliation, will be included.The legislation has gone as far as possible towards maintaining the status quo and trying, in the complex area the Deputy recognises, to organise a charitable sector which for a long time had no organisation.  We must also recognise that this is a first step and there will be a mandatory review.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, and 65 are related and may be discussed together.Seanad amendment No. 2:Section 2: In page 8, subsection (1), to delete line 7 and substitute the following:""body" includes, in relation to a trust in respect of which there is only one trustee, that trustee;".

While it is unlikely there are many, if any, single trustee charities, on the basis of legal advice, amendment No. 2 amends the definition of body to cater for such a scenario.Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical amendments.  They provide for necessary redefinitions of charitable organisations and trusts arising from section 88, which allows for charitable organisations to enter into certain agreements with charity trustees or connected persons that would have been contrary to the previous definition.Amendment No. 65 emerged from interdepartmental consultations relating to how a charity might act on dissolution.  A fundamental principle of the Bill as currently drafted is that a charity should apply all of its property for the stated charitable purpose, even when the charity is dissolved.  In the course of this consultation, the possibility emerged that some charities might not be bound under their constitutions on dissolution to distribute the remaining property to the charitable purposes.  Under these two amendments, which address the potential loophole, any such charity would have to obtain the consent of the authority to pay any of the property to members of the charity on dissolution of that charity.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I welcome the amendment, because there are professional people who give a good deal of time to charity.  There may be times when such people need to be paid for work done.  It is only right that this is the case, provided there is no conflict.  If such a person is an auditor, he or she should not be allowed to audit the accounts.  However, if someone were to do professional work, which costs money and a good deal of time, that person is entitled to get paid for it.I refer to the single charities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, stated the matter is technical and that there are not many charities in the country with only one person as a director.  The reason this is included is to allow for a case where there might be an anomaly in the Bill, which I accept.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I agree with the amendments.  The last matter raised draws attention to the question of many trusts which, because of the death of other trustees, have only one remaining member.  That may need to be addressed under different legislation, but it is a significant concern for trusts throughout the country.  For example, it may be a concern in sports organisations which have a trustee for the grounds and so on.  There is a need to bring the legislation on the number of trustees up to speed for such organisation.  Some people give a significant amount of their time voluntarily, but there are other instances where remuneration must occur.  This must be acknowledged and respected.  I am sure the amendment will deal with that aspect of the matter.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I agree with the thrust of the amendment.  A charitable trust is established for charitable purposes and I support the argument that a trust should not be established specifically to enjoy the advantages which other charities enjoy.  A new charitable trust should not be set up to promote human rights or deal with a situation where it seeks to highlight the abuse of human rights in a particular area.  For example, let us consider the most recent outrage.  If I wish to set up a charitable trust tomorrow to examine human rights breaches in Gaza, I should not gain the benefits which are allowed to a charitable trust.The Minister of State may have been correct in his remarks dealing with other amendments to the effect that the legislation will not adversely affect existing charities.  However, this provision will prevent the establishment in future of charities or charitable trusts dealing exclusively with human rights.  Some may seek to by-pass that provision.  If an organisation seeks charitable status or to be accepted as a charitable trust, it must fall within the four points in the legislation.  It could cloud its true intentions and this is not the purpose of the legislation.  When first drafted, the legislation intended to cover the organisations which are truly charitable and which have no intention to make a profit.  The legislation is welcome.  Ireland has a great standing internationally in terms of the money raised here for those purposes.  Those funds have been very welcome in areas of dire straits throughout the world.  However, even within Ireland the people are willing to donate money to a charity.  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that process is properly regulated and I welcome it for this reason.  There is an opportunity for the Minister of State, within the confines of the amendments before us, to address the points made in the discussion on the last section.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I reiterated the position regarding human rights and the position for existing charities.  I specifically set out the charitable purposes for which new charities could be recognised.  That maintains the status quo.  I refer to the remarks of Deputy Wall on the wider issue of trustees and trust law.  There is a difference between the wider issue and the matter with which we are dealing.  I accept the point made.  Deputy Ring mentioned the matter of trustees.  It became apparent as we proceeded with the legislation that frequently, trustees are well qualified people with technical expertise in either law, finance or whatever, and that they frequently offer that expertise at a greatly reduced rate to a given charity.  Had we not tabled this amendment it could have adversely affected many charities.  I thank the Deputies for their support in this regard.

One of my basic aims for the legislation was to make charities secure from takeover or from being undermined or misused by criminal or terrorist groups.  It is vital this does not occur.  Concerns were expressed by Senators during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and similar concerns were previously raised in this House by Deputy Wall.  I thank him for raising the matter in the first instance.  I consulted with the Office of the Attorney General regarding any possible concerns that the existing wording in the Bill relating to terrorism could be interpreted as referring only to terrorism in this jurisdiction.  While my advice is that the existing wording applies to terrorism in any jurisdiction, the amendment is put for the avoidance of any doubt.Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are similar, in that they clarify that section 37 subsection (2) and section 37 subsection (4), respectively, apply to consultative panels established under the direction of the Minister and according to that section.  Amendment No. 59 clarifies that the powers of the authority under section 68 subsection (3) to obtain books, documents or records applies to both charitable organisations and charity trustees.

Amendment No. 7 is a drafting amendment only, removing text considered to be superfluous.  Instead of stating what is "regarded as being" a charitable purpose the revised wording explicitly refers to what "will" be a charitable purpose.  Amendment No. 39 is purely presentational and makes no substantial change to the provision.  It replaces the term "have been" with "are" and places the onus on the charity trustee to ensure accounts are kept on an ongoing basis in a way that facilitates compliance with the regulations under section 47.  The previous use of the term "have been" placed only a retrospective onus on trustees.Amendment No. 47 indents the final paragraph of section 50(14)(b) to clarify that it refers only to paragraph (b) and not to the subsection as a whole.  Amendment No. 57 rearranges the existing wording of section 68(1) purely for presentational purposes and amendment No. 58 tweaks the existing wording to section 68(2) though without any substantive change to the meaning.  Instead of saying that a direction from the authority under section 68(1) to a charity to produce documents etc. may be given in the circumstances outlined in the section 68(2) the new wording says that the authority may only require a charity to provide documents for the specific circumstances outlined in the section to apply.

Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are similar in that they remove some text that on reflection was considered to be unnecessary.  My advice was that a purpose is either charitable or not and that the use of the phrase "regarded as a charitable purpose" was not required in legal terms.In respect of amendment No. 10, since the earlier debates on this in the Dáil and Seanad, I have reflected on those organisations which purport to be religious in nature but whose principal interest is in profit, or whose method may be harmful to its followers.  Deputies Wall and Higgins originally raised this point in amendments.  Some Senators also put it forward.I came to the conclusion that there might be considerable merit in the principle behind the original amendment that nominally religious organisations which in reality have scant regard for the spiritual, psychological or indeed financial well-being of their members or potential members should not be granted the privilege of charitable status.  Accordingly, I introduced an amendment in the Seanad developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General which will ensure that dubious organisations that pose as religious but whose motive is making money, or which use inappropriate psychological techniques in recruiting or retaining members shall not attain charitable status.  I thank members of the Opposition in both Houses for their constructive role in this matter.  I commend amendment No. 10 which addresses an issue that is clearly of concern across both Houses and amendments Nos. 8 and 9.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I welcome the decision of the Minister of State to ensure that this is part of the Bill.  It covers our feelings about representations to the Labour Party and our concerns on reading the first draft of the Bill.  It strengthens the Bill and ensures that people will benefit from it.  We are worried about cults and the unfortunate people they recruit.   We receive e-mails etc. promising us that we will be millionaires in the morning if we do certain things.  The same applies to cults that try to entice young people by offering benefits.  These are good amendments and will be of major significance to families whose loved ones have unfortunately fallen into cults, which may be increasing.  I hope the legislation, with these amendments, will help people who are concerned about those collecting money to develop such cults.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I too support these amendments.  There was strong reference to this topic in the Dáil and Seanad.  I welcome particularly amendment No. 10.I have heard a man speak on radio programmes who has been contacted by families whose members have joined cults and cannot get out but sign everything over to them.  They are not charities and have created many problems for families.  I do not know whether legislation can deal with them but something needs to be done.  One hears harrowing stories about how these cults take over people's minds, bodies and lives, leaving them in such a state that it takes them years to return to ordinary life.  I welcome the amendment, which defines the difference between charitable and other organisations.I will not discuss them in detail today but there are many other areas that we could examine within the church, which create problems for the church.  It may not be for legislators to deal with this but some day that may have to happen.

There may well be other avenues by which to deal with them but following the Opposition suggestions, I was adamant that there would be no refuge for them in this legislation.  There may be other things to do but in regard to this Bill I was happy to be able to respond in particular to Deputy Wall's constructive proposals.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	511	This is a technical amendment inserted on legal advice.  The Bill has always separated the decisions of the new Charities Regulatory Authority from those of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of tax matters.  It is not appropriate for the new authority to have any role in respect of tax matters which are the domain of the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners alone.Every charitable organisation, as well as having exclusively charitable purposes must have a public benefit.  The effect of this amendment is to remove any doubt that Revenue will be in any way bound by any determination of the authority as to whether the purpose of the organisation is of public benefit.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I agree with the Minister of State that the Revenue Commissioners and the new regulatory authority must be separate organisations.  The Revenue Commissioners must have their own authority and must deal with whatever information or otherwise is connected to Revenue issues.  There must be a clear separation between these organisations.  The fact that an organisation has charitable status does not exempt it from compliance with the rules and regulations of the Revenue Commissioners.  There may be instances in which that happens but it must be clear.  I am glad that has been included in the Bill.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Various groups contacted me about this, including Amnesty International, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, Front Line and the Wheel.  They are concerned about this argument.  They say that the Bill already provides that even if the charities regulator recognises an organisation as a charity the Revenue Commissioners have the discretion to refuse to grant the same organisation charitable status from a taxation perspective.  Is there an anomaly there?  Could the regulator give charitable status which the Revenue Commissioners would refuse?

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	518	REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-13 and is subject to different EU regulations from the preceding versions of REPS.  Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments.  The first payment of 75% can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the single payment scheme are completed.  These include checks on areas and on plan details and the controls have to satisfy stringent EU regulatory and audit requirements.Some 9,800 REPS 4 plans have been prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by the Department.  The information on these plans is in computerised format and it was necessary to develop an appropriate computer-based control system for checking them.  This was a lengthy process and the system was only available from late autumn.  The substantial minority of plans submitted this year that were not prepared using eREPS — about 3,000 — have to be checked manually and this is extremely time-consuming.  Industrial action in the Department's local offices last year meant that this part of the process was delayed.  In the circumstances, the Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission was not prepared to allow it.The first payments for 2008 REPS 4 applications were issued in the last week of January to those whose applications required no correction following the administrative checks.  Further payments continue to be made.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	519	For thousands of farmers awaiting payment under REPS 4, that explanation will not wash.  Notwithstanding administrative checks or industrial relations disputes, applications have been with the Department since late 2007, yet neither the Minister or his officials has been in a position to communicate directly with these farmers until now to tell them that there has been such an administrative problem.  Teagasc and private planners are clearly stating that this problem emanates from the Minister's Department and that they were never apprised of any additional requirements for REPS 4 when they were submitting their original applications.I suggest that the Minister go back to the European Commission post-haste and seek permission to pay immediately REPS 4 entitlements for the first year, given the cash difficultly in which farmers find themselves.  Let us use the intervening period between payment for the first year and the second year to resolve outstanding administrative difficulties that have arisen.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I am also concerned with the delay in getting out a REPS payment for which the funding has been provided and is in place.  Almost 11,000 applications were submitted until 15 May 2008, which were related to 2007.  Of the 12,292 REPS 4 applications in 2008, only 11% passed all the administrative checks.  We went to Europe towards the end of the year and we sought permission from the European Commission to continue the previous system whereby advance payments would be issued.  The European Commission would not allow us to do so.  I do not agree with the statements made by some private planners and by some people in Teagasc that it is the fault of the Department.There are obvious errors in these applications.  There are decimal points in the wrong place and there are missing documents——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	521	For God's sake, decimal points should not hold up applications.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	522	This influences the technology.  These are minor errors, but there also errors in which plans are omitted and where there are inadequate biodiversity provisions.  The Department officials have gone back to many individual farmers and their planners and have been in a position to rectify the errors made by the people who submitted the plans in the first place.  We want to eliminate the disparities involved.  More than 2,000 payments have been issued up until last Monday, and they continue to be issued every day.  I do not accept that if plans are sent in with obvious errors, it is somehow the fault of the receiving Department.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	523	It is the fault of the receiving Department, because for over 14 months it has failed to communicate advice in any way to individual applicants or their planners that there has been a difficulty, be it a decimal point or a biodiversity plan.  There is a different interpretation being taken and if these people were not apprised of different interpretations of biodiversity under REPS 4, then that is a failure of communication on the part of the Minister's Department.Given the cash flow difficulties of farmers, can the Minister not make arrangements to pay?  He should go to Brussels, use the Government's muscle and make arrangements to pay the first year of the scheme.  He should give an assurance that in the intervening period, the outstanding issues can be resolved with the individual farmers and their planners.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I said that there was a range of errors from omission of plans to wrongly designated areas.  Surely the official examining that particular application in the Department is not responsible for sending in the wrong information——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The Minister has not communicated with the farmers in 14 months.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	526	During the course of 2008, REPS 4 was not the only REPS programme analysed and funded by the Department.  The Department paid out €330 million in 2008 under the REPS 3 programme.  Those applications were processed and paid out.  The European Commission has made it known to us in no uncertain terms that it wants all applications checked and all errors rectified before payments can be issued.A new measure introduced by the Department will make it compulsory for REPS planners to submit all plans using eREPS, which is the Department's electronic planning system.  This system will include built-in automatic checks which will ensure that information provided by planners avoids the main errors discovered in the recent administrative checks.  This will considerably reduce the time taken up by the process of administrative checks.  If the planner submits an application that contains an error, the Department's technology will reject that application and this will eliminate errors.  The Department put considerable resources into putting in place this particular technological system.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Not good enough.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Very substantial funds have been issued and are being issued.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	529	In adopting the sixth environmental action plan in 2002, the European Parliament and the Council agreed an approach involving implementation and revision of the relevant legal framework for pesticides, through the development of a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides.  The thematic strategy is designed to revise and enhance the existing legislative framework and to target the use phase of plant protection products.The objectives of the strategy set out in the communication are to encourage rational and responsible use of pesticides, as well as appropriate crop and soil management practices; to improve the behaviour of pesticide users, by ensuring better training and education; and to improve the quality of pesticide application equipment to optimise the effectiveness of treatment, while minimising adverse impact on human health and the environment.  Implementation of the strategy has resulted in the European Commission submitting proposals for a directive establishing a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides; a regulation of the European Council and of the Parliament concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market; and a regulation of the European Council and of the Parliament concerning statistics on plant protection products.The main provisions of the directive on sustainable use of pesticides address the establishment of national action plans to set objectives to reduce risks; an obligatory system of training and certification for professional users of pesticides; inspection of application equipment; prohibition of aerial spraying with possible derogations; specific measures to protect the aquatic environment; designation of areas of greatly reduced or zero pesticide use; handling and storage; integrated pest management; and establishment of harmonised risk indicators for pesticides.On its adoption and implementation, the proposal will lead to a wide range of additional controls to enhance further the degree of protection afforded those distributing, handling and using plant protection products; a requirement to prepare national action plans to reduce the risks associated with use of plant protection products, involving a systematic and co-ordinated programme to reduce further the degree of risk arising for the environment; and a requirement for deployment of additional resources, by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and its associated agencies, to give effect to the range of additional measures introduced.The proposed directive on sustainable use of pesticides is progressive and ambitious.  Adoption of this proposal will further enhance the high level of protection afforded to humans, animals and the environment already achieved through the current regulatory system for pesticides.  It will serve to limit the use of plant protection products to situations where their use is essential and will extend the range of controls in place governing the use of pesticides.During negotiations, the Department has ensured that any additional controls proposed are justified and would make a real contribution to the sustainability of environmentally sensitive agricultural production in Ireland.  In this regard, the issue of "use reduction" targets in the proposals presented difficulties in an Irish context.  While the directive will not place obligations on landowners  per se, it will place obligations on the users of pesticides to acquire training and certification, to have their application equipment tested and certified and to implement integrated pest management.  The directive has gone through its Second Reading in the European Parliament and Council and is due for final decision at Council in March 2009.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Minister neglected to mention that before the Common Position was reached, it was proposed to reduce the quantities of pesticides supplied or used by 50%.  That proposal did not take into account the national plant health requirement to have certain substances available.  Similarly, it did not take into consideration the properties of the substances concerned.  Will a list of the specific pesticides that are to be prohibited as a result of the directive, or the Common Position that has been reached, be provided?  The Minister mentioned that people will have to be trained to use pesticides.  Will such training comprise another layer of bureaucracy to be dealt with by landowners and farmers before they can set about their daily business of growing crops?  What is the Irish position on this directive?  I accept that the directive is specifically aimed at protecting human and animal health, which is laudable.  We need to find out, within the remit of Question Time, what impact the directive will have on farmers and landowners.  Will a list of pesticides be prescribed?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Deputy Sherlock's questions relate to the regulation rather than the directive.  Ireland, like other European countries, will have to draw up an action plan.  With regard to the regulation, we oppose the proposal to introduce hazard-based cut-off criteria for the approval of substances.  The Deputy asked about training.  People will be trained to apply and use pesticides properly, in line with best practice.  Certain forms of machinery will be used to apply various pesticides at different times.  Public commentary on this issue often causes confusion when people refer to the "directive" rather than the "regulation".  I understand that until now, the approval phase involved various products being deemed to be suitable for use on land.  The residue regulations provide for consumer protection.  The directive and regulation under discussion will address a lacuna that exists in the use phase, when a particular pesticide is applied.  While Ireland and Britain are often on different sides of the argument at meetings of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, we have been ad idem with Britain and Hungary on these measures.  We have opposed some of the proposals because we believe we should have had an opportunity to undertake an impact assessment of them.  We have not received such a concession from the European Commission.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	532	When Ministers speak about EU legislation, they have a tendency to use words like "lacuna".  The Minister's response was somewhat confusing.  I will try to interpret it as best I can when I read the Official Report.  If there is a Common Position and a framework for Community action, there will be a prescribed set of pesticide uses or functions.  Will there be a defined list?  Will pesticide users be required to undertake training?  Does the Minister envisage that this will be implemented within a certain timeframe?  The Minister has said that Ireland had an alliance with Britain and Hungary on this issue, but what position did the three countries take?  Did Ireland abstain when the vote was taken on the final Common Position?  Did Ireland vote against it?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	533	If these proposals are approved by the Council, an action plan will be put in place by the middle of 2011.  We received support at official and political level from our counterparts in Britain and Hungary for our position, which we argued consistently.  If I recall correctly, no other country supported the position.  We expressed particular concerns about the proposal to base decisions on hazard-based cut-off criteria, rather than on the scientific principles of risk assessment.  Some substances that are crucial to crop protection in Ireland may fail to meet the new cut-off criteria.  With regard to some fungicide uses, for example, we argued consistently that consideration should be given to this country's climate conditions.  Mediterranean countries like Spain are concerned about insecticide, whereas Ireland's damp climate means that fungicide is the major issue here.  As we have consistently pointed out, we do not have the final text of the proposal that will be put to the Council of Ministers next month.  We do not know exactly what it will be.  For some time, it has been suggested that an action plan will have to be drawn up by the middle of 2011.  If the proposals are agreed and need to be implemented at EU level, the Department will meet the relevant stakeholders in the middle of this year to consult them.  One of the factors driving these proposals at Commission level is a recent Eurobarometer report, which found that the use of pesticides is the biggest concern of EU citizens when it comes to food safety issues.  This issue will not go away.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Under the agreement that was concluded with pig processors in December 2008, €180 million is being made available from the public finances to help processors to fund the recall and destruction of certain pork products that were in the market or in storage at the time of the recall.  The details of the agreement, which allowed processing plants to resume operations within a week, are reflected in the pigmeat recall scheme that has been established by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The scheme, which covers affected products in Ireland and in overseas markets, is important in so far as it will ensure that such products are destroyed and will facilitate the return to normal market conditions.  The Department is involved in other activities to assist the pigmeat sector.  Along with Bord Bia, the Department is actively seeking to restore access to markets that were temporarily closed due to the dioxin incident.  I am glad that our efforts to date have brought some success.  The frank and open way in which we dealt with the issue has borne fruit.The EU "aids to private storage" scheme, which has a potential cost of €15 million, might also prove beneficial in this regard.  It allows for the temporary removal of 30,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the market.  Some €37.1 million has been paid so far under the pork recall scheme, which provides for assistance in respect of eligible produce manufactured from pigs slaughtered in Ireland between 1 September and 6 December 2008.  A case has been made to consider offering help in respect of other products manufactured in Ireland that were affected by the product recall, including products containing both Irish and imported pigmeat and products made here using solely imported pigmeat that, at the time of the recall, could not be segregated satisfactorily to facilitate their sale.  The Department is considering the position of such products and the claims made by some people in the industry.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The pig industry is not yet out of the woods in so far as this crisis is concerned.  I implore the Minister to continue to micro-manage this issue.  Producers and processors are dealing with serious issues.  It is one thing that the markets are open, but it is a significantly different thing to regain market share on the supermarket shelves.  Does the Minister agree that the Irish taxpayer would be appalled at the prospect of having to pay compensation to Irish processors of bacon from the Netherlands, Chile or any other foreign country?  The Minister and his Department, like the Minister's predecessors who were responsible for previous programmes for Government, have failed to deliver an adequate system of country of origin labelling.  It was a flag of convenience in previous programmes for Government, but it has not been delivered.  As a result of the Department's failure to deliver country of origin labelling, Irish taxpayers may have to pay compensation in respect of pork that was not produced here.This country's bovine compensation scheme, which pertains to animals that are diseased, is well established.  No similar scheme is available in the pig industry, perhaps for good reasons.  Compensation has been paid in respect of bovine animals that were fed with contaminated feed during the recent crisis.  I understand the level of compensation is relatively close to the cost of replacing those animals.   Those in the pig sector have been left swinging in the wind; the compensation they have received comes nowhere near meeting re-entry costs.  Is it the Department's unspoken agenda to force these producers out of the business, given that the compensation offered to them comes nowhere near meeting re-entry costs.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I reject the Deputy's final comments.  I fully appreciate the serious difficulties arising from the contamination incident caused to individual pig producers, the processing industry and everybody involved in the pork trade.From day one the Department and Government worked extremely hard to bring a conclusion to that incident as rapidly as possible.  This House agreed a Supplementary Estimate prior to Christmas to enable the issuing of interim payments, which were crucial to stimulate movement in the system again.  Such payments needed to trickle down to the individual pig producer who was waiting for payment from the processing facilities.In regard to labelling, the Department of Health and Children, on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, put forward specific proposals to the European Commission on labelling for pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat on a number of occasions.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	537	It is not listening to those who put them forward.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Unfortunately, those proposals were not accepted by the European Union.  I mentioned at a recent committee meeting, and the Deputy questioned me on this recently, that I had observed a different attitude to labelling among other member states, country of origin labelling and European Union labelling.  The Minister, Mr. Benn, in our nearest neighbour Britain, spoke recently about the need for consumers to know from where their food originates.  It is a welcome move by Britain that it wants the know from where food is coming.  Some other member states have also expressed an interest in this issue.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Is the Minister aware of the period of delay between producers providing pigs to processors and payment being received?  The period of delay is significantly different from the period involved prior to the dioxin contamination?  In addressing that, will the Minister indicate how much money has been paid out?  If it is necessary to pay out additional funds to the processors or others who have been affected, it should be done quickly to ensure these people can have the financial muscle to re-establish themselves in the market.  Bord Bia has a role to play, but these individual companies also need financial assistance to regain market share and to pay farmers for the pigs they are producing.  How much money has been drawn down?  Are payments imminent?  When will all the money be drawn down?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	540	Under the specific pork recall scheme, €37.1 million has been paid to date.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Some €37 million.

Naturally every claim from a  processor must be validated.  As the Deputy rightly said, we have to protect the taxpayer.  Whether the product is abroad or here, it must be rendered and validated by a competent authority.  We will not pay out money until the relevant checks have been done.  That does not include the figure for payments made to farmers who unfortunately had to have their herds slaughtered.  I will not give a figure for that, but I can clarify it and advise the Deputy tomorrow.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Does the Minister realise that some producers are contemplating not killing animals again?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recognises the key role that farmers can play in providing feedstocks for biofuel and biomass production.  Our role is to support the supply side of the market by assisting farmers to grow energy crops.  In accordance with the national bioenergy action plan, we are providing a number of incentives to improve the profitability of growing energy crops.In 2007, we introduced a bioenergy scheme to encourage farmers to plant miscanthus and willow for bioenergy purposes.  Aid is available to cover 50% of establishment costs, subject to a maximum payment of €1,450 per hectare.  The scheme has generated considerable interest with more than 1,800 hectares planted so far.  The third phase was launched recently to aid the planting of a further 1,800 hectares in 2009.  Further supports for energy crop production include EU and national premiums worth €125 per hectare.  Aid for energy crop production is also available under the rural environment protection scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme, subject to some restrictions on the areas planted.  As a further support measure, land planted with energy crops can qualify for the single farm payment.The Department is also funding research projects that relate directly to energy crops through the research stimulus fund programme.  The aim of this research is to identify plant varieties and crop production systems that are most suited in the Irish context.  Teagasc is also assisting farmers in energy crop cultivation.  It is carrying out research on growing energy crops at the Oak Park Crops Research Centre and it provides technical advice to landowners on how best to grow energy crops.  In 2008, it published a farm diversification manual providing detailed technical advice on energy crop cultivation.  Together with Teagasc, my Department co-funded an educational DVD to advise farmers on planting and harvesting willow and miscanthus.  I can obtain a copy of that DVD for the Deputy if would like it.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.These measures are intended to complement the demand side schemes introduced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to promote the use of biofuels in the Irish transport market.  The mineral oil tax relief scheme valued at €205 million and the proposed biofuel obligation scheme should provide an additional stimulus for the production of energy crops.The cultivation of energy crops provides an alternative land use option for farmers and is part of the solution to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  I am confident that the measures introduced by my Department will assist farmers in realising the many opportunities to grow energy crops.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I understand the target set by the EU Commission for the production of biofuels is 10% by 2020.  The European Parliament and its environment committee, which consists of members from across the political divide, voted to scale down the proposed EU-wide target of 10% by 2020 to 4% by 2015.  Notwithstanding the 1,800 hectares of miscanthus planted, to which the Minister of State referred, we have moved from the planting of 137 hectares of energy crops in 2003 to just more than 9,000 hectares in 2007, which represents approximately 0.02% of all agricultural land.  Teagasc has estimated that potentially 75,000 to 100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on food production.Are the targets that have been set realistic?  Is the Government doing enough to encourage farmers to get into the business of growing crops for fuel?  How will the food versus fuel debate impact on Ireland?  What is the Government doing to encourage more farmers to diversify into such production?  Is there a ready market available for fuel crops?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Tá cúpla ceist ansin.  Ar dtús, on the fuel versus food issue, as the Deputy mentioned, we are a long way from the conflict in this area that pertains in other parts of the world, given that we have only 6,000 hectares of such crops planted.  The evaluation is that we could plant up to 70,000 hectares before we would have to make the difficult choices being made in other parts of the world.  Such production impacts mainly on water resources.  In those countries the volume of water taken to grow fuel crops might otherwise be for human consumption.There is no doubt that a market must be available for such crops.  There also must be a willingness to produce them.  Miscanthus is more popular than willow, even though there is good reason to plant willow.  Marketing is also a factor.  The trend can be detected from what is being done in the sector.  For example, cereal farmers are more inclined to diversify into oil seed rape production, which necessitates the use of similar machinery and agronomy, of which the farmers have experience.A number of factors come into play.  It is too early to say whether the 10% target is realistic.  The jury is still out on that.  It will not be advantageous for us if the target set is complied with through imports of such crops simply for the sake of complying with a bureaucratic target.  We must closely monitor the position to ensure we are not impacting on other marketable areas of food production for the sake of reaching a nominal percentage target set by the EU.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I put it to the Minister that it is hardly a bureaucratic target, it is a political target that was reached partly with the agreement of the green movement throughout the European Union.  I do not mean to be facetious when I say that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Politics is part of bureaucracy, as the Deputy knows.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	554	We are currently at a point where fuel prices have decreased due to the fall in oil prices.   The Government has a tendency to take its foot off the pedal with regard to developing a coherent and long-term policy.  Post CAP reform, there will be an abyss into which many Irish farmers will fall.  There will be significant loss of revenue.  This is one way in which the slack can be taken up.  I put it to the Minister that the Government must come back to the House with a defined Government policy on how farmers can look to the future with regard to alternative energy production and the creation of markets.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	555	That review is underway and I look forward to further questions in order that we can report on it.  The Department is reviewing the scheme and intends to have that completed by mid-2009 in order to assess the need for a further scheme.  The new scheme will require State aid approval and we must address this as well as additional Exchequer funding.  It will have to take account also of all other demands made.  A growth area such as bio-energy must be encouraged because it is an investment that will ensure we are not so dependent on imported fuel.  Although we export 80% of our food production we import 90% of the energy for it.  Somewhere along the line we must try to reduce that import dependency.  Bio-fuel is one of the ways of achieving that.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The farm waste management scheme was introduced by my Department in March 2006 in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  The farm improvement scheme was introduced in July 2007 under the aegis of the 2007-13 rural development programme.  The deadline for completion of work and the submission of claims for grant payment under the farm waste management scheme expired on 31 December 2008, although applicants were permitted to submit certain supporting documentation up to 9 January 2009.Almost 17,400 claims remain to be processed to payment stage under the farm waste management scheme in 2009 and, in view of the exceptional number of payment claims received, my Department is undertaking a review of the situation which includes an assessment of the overall cost of these claims.  I have already confirmed on a number of previous occasions that farmers will receive payment in respect of all works which have been completed prior to the deadline in accordance with my Department's technical specifications.Last week, the Government took a number of decisions on the overall expenditure control and economic strategy that included the funding for the farm waste management scheme and arrangements for payment of grant aid on a phased basis.  My Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on the implications for the Department's Vote and the details that will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume next month.Significant funding has been made available under the farm waste management scheme since its introduction in 2006, with over €527 million spent over the last two years alone.  In addition, almost €13 million has been made available under the farm improvement scheme over the same period and claims are being processed and payments made as normal by my Department under the latter scheme.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I am not sure whether we are supposed to jump up and down and clap when we hear the Minister say he will pay.  The big question for farmers is when they will be paid.  Is the Minister aware that for every month he delays payment — I will not make reference to the charter of rights which speaks about payment within eight weeks — interest payments made by farmers to banks come to approximately €3 million?  That sum comes directly from farmers' pockets.I presume that before the Minister came into the House he was talking about recapitalising the banks.  Possibly after he leaves here he will continue to do so as he will return to a Cabinet meeting.  That policy should inform every Department and the way in which they approach such issues.  Paying the farmers their farm waste management scheme grants would, in effect, recapitalise the banks.  The farmers will take the grant with one hand and hand it with the other to the bank managers to whom they owe money.  My questions for the Minister are simple.  When will they be paid?  Will he bring in a Supplementary Estimate to provide for payment?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I said earlier that the payments would be made on a phased basis.  The Government is not in a position to make full payment this year.  What has been decided is to have payments made on a phased and proportionate basis.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  More than 18,000 farmers have been paid in full.  Over 17,000 remain to be paid.  The expenditure available to us this year will enable us to pay all the remaining 17,400 payment claims when they are processed.  Of those a 40% payment will be made during the course of this calendar year, 40% of the remaining payment will be made in the first days of January 2010 and the remaining 20% in January 2011.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	573	This funding will amount to approximately €550 million.  If one takes the coming January date, within ten months €988 million will have been paid out of a scheme that will cost the Exchequer in excess of €1 billion.  This means that 90% of all eligible claimants will be paid by 3 January next.  With the funding available this year we could have made a decision to pay more than 7,000 applicants their full payment.  That would not be fair to other people who would receive no payment this year.  The Government decided that payments should be made on a proportionate basis, namely, 40% to claims that are processed and cleared with immediate effect.  Others will be paid 40% of their entitlement as they are cleared and passed during the year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I will allow a further supplementary question from Deputy Creed.

Reckoning an average payment of approximately €33,000 would have told the Minister what his Department Estimate required.The Minister is in Cabinet and he and his colleagues are contemplating recapitalising the banks.  Payment of the farm waste management scheme will recapitalise the banks, indirectly.  I assure him that 99% of payments he will make out will go into banks.Let us get down to brass tacks.  I have had individual farmers sit opposite me with their wives, in tears because they did not have money to put bread on the table.  The Minister should look at the range of other issues in which he is failing to make payments, in REPS and the farm investment scheme, in reduced payments in the suckler cow and the disadvantaged area schemes.  The Minister has been an unmitigated disaster.

It is not money for farmers but it will enable them to meet their requirements to continue in business.I have one final question for the Minister.  Will he meet the farmers' interest repayments?  He stated the payments would be in the order of 40%, 40% and 20% over three years, which I reject as unacceptable.  To make that more palatable, will he meet the contingent interest liabilities that farmers must pay in the meantime?

I was told during the course of last year, before July, when €150 million had been provided for this scheme, that no further payments would be made between July and December.  A sum of €150 million was provided in the Estimates at that time.  Before the year was out we had allocated €414 million in payments and we have provided——-

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	597	During the summer I was told payments under the scheme would cease.  At that time we had spent €150 million.  The Department put in another €32 million, a further €195 million of a Supplementary Estimate, which was regarded as an exceptional item of expenditure, and a further €30 million before the end of the year.  We brought the payments practically up to date by the end of the year, amounting to €414 million——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	598	As the Minister should.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	599	During December more than 14,000 claims came in.  We were told by plenty of people in this House that work would not be done and claims would not be made.  We stated very clearly that payments would be honoured.  The suckler cow scheme is a new stream of income that was paid out for the first time during December.  Some €33 million was paid out before the end of the year and another €12 million has already been paid during January——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The Minister should deal with the farm waste scheme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Deputy Creed brought up the supplementary measures.  Some €313 million was also paid out during 2008 under REPS.  All these commitments will be honoured.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I expect to be able shortly to confirm the position regarding payments under the suckler welfare scheme.  More than 53,000 farmers applied for the scheme in 2008 and the estimated cost, at a rate of €80 per cow, will be some €77 million for 2008.  By the end of 2008, €33 million was spent on the scheme.  A further €44 million has been provided in my Department's Estimate for 2009 to pay for the remaining 2008 born calves.  Of this €44 million, more than €12 million has been paid out to farmers already in January and payments are continuing on a weekly basis as additional animals become eligible.  It must be borne in mind that the money paid to farmers under this scheme is an additional income stream that was not there before last year and that all of this money is coming from the Exchequer.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I will be as direct and as straight as I can be to assist the Minister.  This was introduced at €80 per head and was then reduced to €40 per head.  Will the Minister make a statement to the farmers and the nation to categorically dispel the existing rumour that this scheme will be abolished?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	605	This scheme was introduced with funding of €250 million to be provided over five years.  In the first year of applications there was a very large take up and the total cost of the 2008 scheme amounts to €77 million.  A sum of €33 million was provided in the Estimates for 2008 and this scheme, by its nature, is claimed for only towards the end of the year with calves weaning.  Some €33 million was spent in 2008 and the remaining €44 million due for the 2008 scheme will be paid.  A total of €12 million has been paid since 1 January and payments continue.  No decision has been made on the rate of payment that would apply to this scheme for 2009.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	606	Will the Minister give assurances that this scheme will be in place for the next five years?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	607	This scheme was introduced last year——

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I indicated that the €250 million provided for the scheme was not €80 per animal.  It was introduced at the beginning on the basis that there would be €250 million over five years.  The intention is to honour that scheme.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The Minister said 53,000 farmers applied, but the relevant figure is how many animals were applied for.  The calculation was on the basis that one would need €77 million for a year, yet only €44 million was paid out in 2008, because there were animals that carry over.  Is it correct that €44 million is still due on the 2008 applications?  When the five years are up there will be animals that will not be claimed for until the year after the scheme closes.  Is the Minister prepared to re-evaluate the amount of money up from €40 if the number of animals claimed for is smaller?  If the €40 is paid out in years two, three and four, will he save the money and continue to pay €40 or does he intend to revise the figure, if possible, upwards?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	611	As Deputy Doyle rightly said, the number of applications was almost 54,000 and the number of beef breed calves born in the scheme last year was 974,000.  The funding paid out under the 2008 scheme during the calendar year 2008 was €33 million and €44 million is provided in the 2009 Estimate to pay the remainder of the 2008 scheme.  Many of the applications would come in only at the end of the year and there would be that carry-over into 2009 but the payment is in respect of the 2008 scheme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I very much doubt that because the demand on the scheme will be sufficient to draw down the funding available.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	614	A number of complaints and requests have been sent to the Wexford office and information has circulated from that office to the local and district Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food offices.  They have been told in typical Departmental speak, vague and meaningless, how to answer those questions.  This is nothing more than a delaying tactic.  Has the Minister seen this and verified that it should go out?  This is regarding payments to farmers of overdue payments.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The suckler cow payments are processed from the Portlaoise office of the Department and I am not aware of people awaiting payments.  In many instances the Department has been back to individual farmers clarifying aspects of the applications that were deficient, or whatever.  The payments are issuing rapidly.  If there is a query about a particular applicant we will check it out.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	621	On a point of information, these notices came from the Department to all local offices.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The agreed rates of additional modulation will generate approximately €120 million in total over the four years from 2009-2012 in transfers from the single farm payment to rural development.  These additional funds will stay in Ireland and be passed back to Irish farmers under the rural development programme.  As such, the additional modulation represents a redistribution of money from the single farm payment scheme to other farm payment schemes.  As this process will involve the transfer of funds from one type of payment to another, it will be income-neutral for farmers as a whole.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	623	That is not true.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	624	In line with the new regulations the funds must be used for measures to address the so-called "new challenges" of climate change, water management, bio-energy and biodiversity, dairy restructuring and innovation.  The consultation process as to how these funds can best be used for the development of Irish agriculture is currently under way.  It is also worth noting that more than 50,000 Irish farmers will be exempt from the increased rate of modulation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The Minister may not have the statistics, but could he tell us what will be the total annual benefit to the agriculture industry of the modified arrangement?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	626	With the existing modulation arrangements, the amount collected annually is €42.5 million.  That modulation is in place up to 5%.  With the new rates that will be applicable there will be an increase in modulation rate of 2% this year and 1% in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The additional funding that will be generated for the modulated fund will be €17 million this year, €25 million in 2010, €34 million in 2011 and €42 million in 2012.  That brings the cumulative amount in the period up to 2012 to a total of almost €120 million.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The Minister said these would be zero gain, but there will be a net loss to some farmers who will not avail of some of the schemes.  Can the Minister clarify whether some of the REPS 4 budget is being taken out of the modulated money?  The spin on this is that REPS 4 and single farm payments have separate budgets, but is this a transfer of funds from the single farm payment into REPS 4?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Up to now the modulated funds that were available, which were fairly small, went into the overall rural development programme.  The Exchequer puts a substantial amount more into the rural development programme than the necessary requirement, because it is co-funded by the European Union.  Deputy Doyle's point is correct in that there was an effort in the past to ensure the modulated funds would go to the broader rural development programme, which would encompass measures outside the farm gate.  In the health check, I argued strenuously that the money should be retained on farms and not go to programmes that did not directly benefit individual farmers.  Programmes will be introduced, particularly in the areas of climate change, water conservation, biodiversity and innovation, which can be availed of by individual farmers.  I said in my initial response that the consultation process had begun and we have asked for submissions to be returned to the Department by 16 February.  All the funding will go back to on-farm activities, not those outside the farm gate, as other countries would have argued for.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The question is whether there will be a loss of money to farmers.  The point of modulation, as the Minister has stated, is to contribute towards environmental measures such as water conservation.  Will the moneys involved be controlled by the Department?  Will they be paid directly to farmers, or will they be paid to other agencies as determined by the Department to administer those schemes?  The point is whether farmers will lose money through the measures that are supposed to be incorporated within modulation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The funding will remain in schemes operated by the Department, not outside bodies.  For argument's sake, we could have a top-up in REPS which would consist of an extra measure, but the money will not go to agencies, projects or programmes that are outside the farm gate.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Dairy farmers' incomes comprise the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces have a significant and increasing influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from dairy product sales in international markets.  Dairy product prices reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008, and producer prices also peaked at that time.  Since then, international prices have fallen back considerably, although the average Irish producer price for 2008 was similar to the 2007 price.  The indications are that markets will remain weak in the first half of 2009.I made it clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel that a range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under market prices.  The Commission initially responded by commencing the 2009 butter private storage scheme two months early.   Subsequently, on 15 January, the Commissioner announced further measures to assist the dairy sector, which included a commitment under the intervention system to purchase more than the fixed quantities of butter — 30,000 tonnes — and skimmed milk powder — 109,000 tonnes — if the market situation requires it.  In addition, she announced the reintroduction of export refunds for butter, milk powders and cheese, and these were reinstated at the milk management committee meeting on 22 January.Irish operators can now avail of these refunds and my Department will continue to examine the position and urge the Commission to set the refunds at an appropriate level to support the dairy sector.  During the health check negotiations, I argued strongly in favour of keeping critical market instruments in place and using them effectively.  These support measures can now be used to respond to price volatility in the current market situation and will help support the dairy sector in Ireland.  While we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  The main international forecasting organisations predict global growth in wealth and population in the medium term.  This will present new opportunities for high-quality producers such as Ireland, and all areas of the dairy sector can expect to reap the rewards.One of the major challenges in the medium term is to ensure that Irish farming and the agrifood sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market which is focused on quality and innovation.  As part of this overall strategy, the Department provided funding of €140 million towards investment in dairy processing.  A total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded grant assistance under the fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  In the meantime, I assure the House that I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves and in view of the particular difficulties facing the market at present.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Could the Minister clarify the products covered by the export refunds that were recently introduced?  In addition, I ask the Minister what he considers to be the general outlook with regard to dairy pricing.  How does he feel the dairy investment fund will improve the dairy industry?  Could he comment on the benefits of the CAP health check to the dairy sector?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	633	With regard to dairy prices, as Deputy Collins knows and as I mentioned in my earlier comments, the dairy market has been volatile and things are difficult for producers and processors at present.  We had good prices in 2007 but difficulties arose in 2008 due to the extra supply coming from New Zealand, turbulence in the global financial market and the lack of demand worldwide.  New Zealand, which is a big exporter, can benefit from a favourable exchange rate.  All of this makes things difficult for Irish and European producers.  Prices are low in New Zealand and the US and the recession is reducing consumer demand.  As I said, New Zealand benefits from having its own currency which can be devalued when necessary.  It is a major exporter.  Fonterra, its major processor, is the biggest exporter in the world.  Thus, things are difficult for producers in terms of prices, and processors have indicated that the first half of this year will be particularly difficult.Export refunds are applicable to butter, skim milk powder, whole milk powder and cheese.  The Deputy also asked about the health check.  This country has a strong dairy industry, notwithstanding the pressures on the market at present.  Additional milk quota will be valuable and beneficial to dairy farmers.  It will bring extra capacity to the country and will be put to good use.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I accept that this is a difficult time and many of the problems are dictated by global conditions.  What we need is far more aggressive use of market support measures at European Union level.  The Minister said that the picture looks difficult for the first half of 2009, which is the peak milk production time for Irish farmers.  The Minister will be aware that some processors are talking about a doomsday scenario, with farmers paid in the region of 19 or 20 cent per litre for milk.  That is the cost of production.  Farmers will not be able to ride out that type of price volatility.  Notwithstanding what has been achieved in Brussels, as the Minister has outlined, does he accept the necessity to go back to ensure that a more realistic price can be paid by processors if there is more aggressive use of market support measures?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	635	A number of Deputies wish to speak so I ask people to be brief.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	636	Deputy Creed is right.  The market mechanism measures can take product off the market, thus giving it a boost.  During the course of the health check, many countries argued that such measures should be much restricted and that the Commission should decide when they were invoked.  We argued strongly for the need for the private storage system, the intervention system and the export refunds.  The market management committee is meeting on 19 February.  We have indicated to the Commission that we are adamant that there should be a higher level of refund to support the market.  We have argued for that.  The private storage scheme was brought forward to 1 January.  We have argued strongly to the Commission, and will continue to do so, that we need to make maximum use of the market mechanisms that are available in view of the particular difficulties that exist at present.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I welcome any support measures.  Does the Minister accept that it is pointless to get an increase in quota when we do not have an increased market?  Clearly, increased production at European level and elsewhere has affected the price.  How can he give such a positive view of the world market when production in the US and elsewhere is constantly increasing?  The US, in fact, is now using storage systems to prop up its own market.  Can the Minister assure us that he will exert maximum pressure to increase the use of intervention and other measures to underpin the drastic prices available at present?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The Deputy pinpoints the particular difficulties facing the market.  Additional quota will be useful.  The commodity price and this industry have suffered from cycles.  We can suffer problems arising from the currency, which can be in our favour at times and against it at others, while in 2007 there was a drought in New Zealand which reduced production there.  The US emerged as an exporter and was helped in that by the weak dollar.  However, higher feed costs there and the strengthening of the dollar slowed that trend.  Undoubtedly, farming practices that increase production or decrease production in any of the major producing countries have an adverse effect on us.  There is a limited market.With regard to the medium term, a couple of years ago we could have discussed the growing affluence of highly populated countries such as India, China and Asia, the changing dietary requirements of people there, the huge growth in population and new markets evolving in those countries for dairy products.  That is not as applicable today as it was at that time or a year ago.  The only consistent trend is the growth in the world's population.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has produced long-term forecasts on the likely demand for food and has indicated that food production will have to double by 2050.  I appreciate that this is no good for the individual farmer who is getting a bad price for milk today.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	639	To what extent does the Minister believe that the commodification of dairy products and the fact that they are tradeable commodities has an effect on the markets and on the price of milk for Irish farmers?  This should be taken into account.  Are there discussions at EU level or within the WTO framework to tackle the fact that commodification is causing great vagaries in prices?  That is having an impact on the market here.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	640	With regard to the price supports the Minister mentioned and his talks with Commissioner Fischer Boel, what do they mean in a practical sense to a farmer who is offered 19 cent per litre when the farmer's production costs are probably 22 cent or 23 cent?  In the last three or four years farmers have been mandated to follow EU directives relating to issues such as waste management on their farms, the nitrates directive and so forth.  They have been asked to spend a great deal of money on their farms.  In some cases the Department has announced schemes.  It allocated €56 million for one of them but thousands of farmers have not even received that money and do not know if they will get it.  At the same time that the Minister has imposed this burden on farmers, the processors are offering them 19 cent per litre, a reduction from 29 cent.  In the case of some winter milk producers, it is a reduction from approximately 39 cent.  The Minister must answer the farmers' questions.  How are they to stay in production if that is the price they will be given by the processors?  What is the Government going to do about it, considering what the Minister has mandated farmers to do under EU directives?  What will the EU do to try to save some of these family farms that are facing non-viability within the next year?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	641	In response to Deputy Deasy, the market mechanism measures we discussed previously are European Union wide.  Everybody knows the law of supply and demand — if there is over-supply or lack of demand, the producer is, unfortunately, the victim.  That is happening with milk production today.  We argued within the European Union, with some success, for the retention of aids to private storage, intervention, which is really public storage, and export refunds.  We succeeded in having the date brought forward for the implementation of some of those measures.  We will argue in the management committee of the European Union next week that the measures should be improved to provide a better baseline price in the industry.  Over-supply, lack of demand, currency problems and global recession are all factors in keeping the price down for the dairy producer.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The total Exchequer allocation to Bord Bia for 2009 is €31.6 million, including specific allocations for quality assurance, that is, the quality assurance scheme, and healthy eating initiatives, such as the Food Dudes programme.  This grant-in-aid, together with an industry contribution of the order of €7 million, will enable Bord Bia to implement a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and services to assist Irish food and drink companies build additional business in Europe, particularly in euro zone countries.  These programmes have been developed in consultation with industry, bearing in mind the impact of the sterling differential on competitiveness.Among the extensive range of activities planned for continental Europe are: a Private Label seminar, France-Belgium, which will be followed up by participation at the MDD — Marques de Distributeurs Alimentaires — trade fair in Paris and mentoring on the requirements of supplying continental supermarket groups; Marketplace Roadshow Spain, which involves building insight into Spanish market requirements, through a seminar on the retail and food service markets and the dynamics of the market, which will be followed by participation at the Club de Gourmet trade fair in Madrid and individually tailored buyer meetings with the largest customers in the market; Portugal market familiarisation, which involves a key insight into market and visiting the Alimentaria trade fair in Lisbon; the Private Label seminar, Scandinavia, Germany and Holland, which includes company specific mentoring on market requirements and participation in the PLMA — Private Label Manufacturers Association — international trade fair in Amsterdam; and food ingredients-nutraceuticals, Europe, which involves providing industry with detailed analysis on market requirements, particularly for dairy ingredients, culminating in participation in the Vita Foods international fair in Geneva.  Other trade fairs where Bord Bia will be promoting the capability of the Irish food, drink and horticulture industry include Biofac in Munich this month, Vinexpo International Wine and Spirits in Bordeaux in June, TFWA Duty Free in Cannes in October, Anuga International in Cologne in October and Food Ingredients Europe in Frankfurt in November.Bord Bia activities will also be prioritised to assist the meat sector following the dioxin contamination incident last year and the board has in place a market recovery campaign to build on the reassurances already provided to customers since the product recall.  My Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia are continuing to work closely on market access issues and will be guided by Irish exporters with regard to programmes and activities required on a market by market and customer by customer basis.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I anticipate that the Minister of State will spend some time in the air to visit some of the events.  I welcome the fact that there is a significant budget for Bord Bia.  It is money well spent when one thinks of the return.  The €8 billion to €9 billion in food exports will be one of the saviours if this economy is to lift itself out of recession.  The emphasis on food production will be vital in that sense.Has there been a full restoration of the markets in light of the pork dioxin scare?  I refer to the markets prior to 6 December.  As I understand it, we have lost some market share to the UK because of the sterling differential, which is a major factor.  I welcome the Minister of State's answer but we need to step up our efforts in terms of the potential of continental Europe given that we have 33% of exports there currently.  There is a greater potential in continental Europe.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to come back with a reply on that one given the timeframe — it is just by way of a general comment.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I appreciate what Deputy Sherlock said.  He has taken a pragmatic approach.  He put his finger on it in terms of the potential of the food market when it comes to the recession.On the pigmeat sector, consumption in Ireland has returned to relative normality quite quickly.  That, in itself, has sent out a positive message demonstrating the confidence of the consumer in Irish pigmeat.  That is what Bord Bia is using in its market recovery campaign.Bord Bia is currently preparing the first in a series of promotional campaigns being launched this month and it is hoped, subject to resources, that this can be followed by two similar campaigns later in the year.  It is intended that these will focus on promoting products bearing the Bord Bia quality mark, which will also communicate origin as the Irish pork and bacon approved label is phased out.The recovery plan has four aspects.  First, there is the customer reassurance programme.  This demonstrates the integrity of Irish health controls, which is the first point that Bord Bia makes internationally in all of our markets.  Second, Bord Bia is working specifically with the Irish embassies, hosting bilateral veterinary meetings so that the people in those countries can be absolutely assured and can speak from a position of knowing everything that must be known about our traceability and our confidence.Third, a trade communications programme is in place.  That is where Bord Bia approaches decision makers in the retail, food service and manufacturing sectors to ensure that there is no breakdown in communication and they understand the primary quality of our product.  Finally, on international access for pigmeat, Bord Bia is approaching opinion formers in the market based around the exemplary health controls.  This involves the media, where Bord Bia gets into magazines and newspapers.

There was no doubt whatsoever and no caveats in that regard.  Unfortunately, that was required to ensure that we would not have any doubt.There is still work to be done.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, is working hard to ensure that our European partners accept that we need improvements in traceability.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

The obligations and requirements contained in the guarantee scheme gave rise to increased engagement with the covered institutions, which included an assessment of the loan book for the Financial Regulator and capital position of all covered institutions by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  This initial assessment was received towards the end of October.  The question of financial transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent was included in the report.  The Department of Finance drew this specific matter to the attention of the Financial Regulator when reviewing that report.  The circumstances of that transaction remain under review by the regulator.  I also understand that the newly appointed board of Anglo Irish Bank is reviewing this matter in the context of finalising the accounts for the year ending 30 September 2008.As part of the planned recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, a further due diligence exercise was undertaken.  Further information was also supplied to my Department by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank as part of detailed consultations with these bodies regarding the implementation of the scheme and in negotiations on recapitalisation proposals.As a result of this increased level of engagement with the banks and Anglo Irish Bank in particular, I became aware of certain unacceptable practices at the bank.  Those issues include loans to directors and a transaction in September between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent.  Regarding the transaction with Irish Life & Permanent, I am advised that Anglo Irish Bank placed funds with Irish Life & Permanent.  A non-bank subsidiary company of Irish Life & Permanent then deposited a similar amount in Anglo Irish Bank as a customer deposit.The Government made it clear when nationalising Anglo Irish Bank that an important factor in reaching this decision related to concerns over corporate governance issues which were undermining confidence in the bank.  The information already in the public domain regarding loans to directors at the bank, and information available to me in the first half of January on the transaction involving Irish Life & Permanent reinforced this decision.Deputies should note that the bank's annual accounts will be published in the coming weeks and will provide further details on directors' loans as well as the transaction involving Irish Life & Permanent.  Matters at Anglo Irish Bank are now the subject of a number of investigations and reviews including those being undertaken by the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  These investigations must be followed up both by the regulatory authorities, which have extensive powers, and by the bank itself.  As Minister for Finance and shareholder of the bank, I will ensure, where appropriate, that any issues identified on foot of these investigations are fully addressed and any misconduct of a criminal or civil character is brought to justice or appropriate compensation is received.The new board is reviewing all the corporate governance practices at the bank and will put arrangements in place to guide Anglo Irish Bank in the future.  I have every confidence that this new board will pursue the necessary changes in this regard.  In all of this it is important to note that the Government is committed to the stability of the Irish banking system.  Depositors and creditors with Irish banks, including those within the full ownership of the State, must be and will be protected.Naturally Deputies will be anxious to know when exactly I learned of the Anglo Irish Bank — ILP transaction.  The matter of financial transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life & Permanent was an issue in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which was received at the end of October.  The Department drew this specific matter to the attention of the Financial Regulator when reviewing the report.  The circumstances of that transaction remain under review by the regulator.  The matter was one of the corporate governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank, which were an important part of the Government's decision to take the bank into public ownership, to ensure the instability such corporate governance issues can cause would not threaten the stability of our financial system, generally.I made it clear at the time of the announcement of the decision to take Anglo Irish Bank into public ownership that a key element of the Government's decision was concern that corporate governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank could destabilise the bank and threaten the stability of the financial system.  This transaction was one of those corporate governance issues.  It would not have been appropriate for me to publicly disclose partial information which was and remains the subject of an investigation by the responsible statutory authority, the Financial Regulator.  The investigation is ongoing into these matters.  It will determine whether legal or regulatory codes were breached.  If legal or regulatory issues arise, then due process will be followed in bringing any parties responsible to account.

Does the Minister recognise that this will be seen right across the board as an exercise in cooking the books and that another financial institution, Irish Life & Permanent, was knowingly involved as it withdrew the deposit some seven days later?Is it not the case that Anglo Irish Bank wanted to avoid collapse and to benefit from the State guarantee, used a deceptive financial ruse to achieve this and that the Irish taxpayer has been the victim of that deception?  The Minister has indicated he became aware of this before the end of October 2008.  A question put to him on 20 January by me and others, when he rose to propose the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, was specifically about whether there was other relevant information this House should know before giving active consideration to the proposal.  The Minister withheld that information from this House.  Did he brief his Cabinet colleagues of this detail he is now confirming he was aware of, from October 2008?  Did he brief his party?  Did he brief the Green Party, and when did it become aware of this?  Will he advise the House of the disclosure of this information to each of those elements of Government?  Will he clarify once again when the Financial Regulator became aware of this?

The Deputy pursued the question of my own awareness of this particular matter and I indicated in my reply that I did not become aware of it until the middle of January of this year.  Information about the transaction was contained in the extensive PricewaterhouseCoopers report and was referred by my Department to the regulator at that stage in the autumn of last year but the specific character of this transaction was explained to me in the middle of January by my officials.

However, because it was a matter pertaining to a customer of the bank, I did not put it before my colleagues or the Taoiseach in explicit terms because confidence in a bank over which we have now taken ownership would be shattered if the Minister for Finance publicly and with abandon disclosed the confidential arrangements made between a bank and its customers.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I immediately insisted that the matter be reported back to me by the board of the bank.  As Deputies will be aware, that board was reconstituted immediately following the bank's nationalisation.  The board indicated to me that it intended to put the matter into the public domain with its annual report.  That is the position in respect of this matter.I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that if the necessary investigations now being undertaken by the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement disclose wrongdoing of a civil or criminal character, these must be pursued.  If they disclose civil wrongdoing, in respect of which I am aware the board of the bank is taking legal advice, those who as a result owe money to the bank must be pursued.  If criminal misconduct is disclosed as a result of the investigations of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, criminal proceedings must and will be taken.  As Deputies will appreciate, that office has a very good record in the prosecution of corporate crime.  In regard to this and other transactions at Anglo Irish Bank, all these matters have to be investigated and the director himself makes these decisions.  Neither the Government nor this House can direct the taking of a prosecution in this country.  It is the responsibility of the director to do that.  It is also his responsibility to determine whether it is appropriate to ask the High Court to appoint an inspector to investigate the circumstances of the bank generally.  Were he to so decide, naturally I have reviewed the legislation with the Tánaiste and any legislative amendment necessary to facilitate a more extensive investigation would be enacted.  However, it is not my function nor is it the function of the Government or this House to direct the director to take a prosecution or to apply to the High Court for the appointment of an inspector.  Clearly, if these steps are warranted they must be taken and any wrongdoing at this bank must be pursued to the ultimate degree.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20422	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions arising from his reply.  He indicated that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report of October contained this information but he did know about it until January.  Did he not read the report?  Did his Department regard this as so trivial that his officials did not bring it to his attention if he did not read the report himself?  Did this transaction, which he noted in his earlier reply was described as a customer deposit even though it clearly was not such a deposit in any normal sense, not ring alarm bells?When he proposed on 21 December to put €1.5 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, did nobody from the Financial Regulator or his Department inform the Minister that the serious issues which had arisen in the way the bank had been behaving were reason for pausing before investing taxpayers' money as if it were a sound bank with a long-term future?  The Minister indicated that reputational damage was the reason he moved from putting in the cash to nationalising the bank but it would now appear that much of the information about the reputational damage was known by his Department and the regulator, without anything being done about it.Why did the Minister feel that he should not reveal this information to the Dáil when we were debating the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank?  The House was quite divided on the nature of the legislation and the appropriateness of the protections that were being included.  My own party indicated that an orderly wind-down was appropriate for a bank that had been seriously damaged.  Why was this not revealed to the Dáil at a time when serious decisions were being made that put taxpayers' money at risk?

On foot of the decision to capitalise, a more extensive and intensive due diligence investigation was carried out and on that basis more precise facts on the transaction were brought to my attention in the middle of last month.  That was one of the factors I took into account in making a recommendation to the Government.I am sure Deputy Bruton is aware that matters relating to customers' deposits and dealings between customers and banks are necessarily confidential in character and cannot be put by me into the public domain in the absence of a concluded investigation.  The investigations into this matter had not concluded but the provisional information available to me in the middle of January was sufficient to satisfy me there would a risk to the taxpayer in this and in the loan transaction——

In all these transactions, the issues raised involving corporate governance were such that I had to advise the Government and Taoiseach, who was abroad at the time, of them.  In regard to this issue, I simply left the matter with my colleagues as a general issue of corporate governance and then proceeded with introduction of the Bill on nationalisation in this House.  I explained to the House that there were issues of corporate governance at Anglo Irish Bank.

I understand from what he said that this loan was reported in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report which his Department received in October.  The Minister stated his officials thought this sufficiently serious they requested the Financial Regulator to investigate the matter but that they did not bring it to his attention until January.  Is that correct?

Is that the position?Is it the case that the Minister knew about this transfer when he came into this House with a proposal to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and did not tell the House about it?  This does not inspire confidence in anybody.  I draw the Minister's attention to the letter sent by the Taoiseach to Deputy Kenny and me in advance of the nationalisation debate cautioning us on the need for responsibility.  What was most important was that the Minister for Finance inform us of what was going on.  The Minister stated, if I understand him correctly, that Anglo Irish Bank placed funds in a subsidiary of Irish Life & Permanent and that Irish Life & Permanent then deposited a similar amount of funds in Anglo Irish Bank.  Can the Minister provide us with the amounts involved in both transactions?

That is not a feature of banking practice unique to Ireland.  A feature of banking practice which took place in all European countries last year and this year was requests that banks mutually support each other in the context of their liquidity.The transaction identified in the report excited interest in my Department and was referred to the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator has not to date reported on the transaction.  When the matter came to my attention in January I insisted that following nationalisation of the bank, the incoming board would deal with this issue and it has done so.  On the amounts involved, I cannot provide that information today.  Obviously, the information I have given is put on the record of the House with the consent of the bank.

Did the Minister say he read the full report or that officials presented him with summaries or blanked or highlighted sections of part of the report?Will the Minister explain the transaction again?  He suggests that Anglo Irish Bank placed funds in what he described as a "customer account" in Irish Life & Permanent.  That is not banking practice; these are corporate accounts.  Why does the Minister use the term "customer"——

This is not a little old lady walking into the bank with a handbag containing €5,000 or €10,000.  These are deposits of €3 billion and €4 billion, a total of €7 billion.  The Minister describes this in a particular way.  I would like him to take us through the process again.  Why does he call the accounts "customer" accounts when they are major wholesale industrial deposits by other banks?  Will the Minister agree this would be a big item on the bank's balance sheet?The Minister said there was a back-to-back transaction.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	771	In regard to major wholesale deposits by other banks, I am glad the Deputy has acknowledged their existence at Anglo Irish Bank because, of course, it is one of the reasons it is essential to safeguard the banking system because of the degree of default which would happen were the bank to have been let go to the wall at any stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is a man of integrity.  There is a lesson here for everybody.  The Minister did not read the full report but the politics of his ministerial office should have put him on alert when his officials told him a section of this report should be referred to the regulator.  He should have asked the reason for the referral and the alarm bells should have gone off at that stage.While stressing that the Minister is a person of integrity, he might explain to the House why the perception outside in the real world is that there has been some kind of cover-up in that the Government did not bring to the attention of the House the information it was aware of at the time of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Irish Life & Permanent issued a statement saying this transfer took place in somewhat exceptional circumstances.  What are these exceptional circumstances?  Can the Minister explain how a double transfer took place from Anglo Irish Bank to Irish Life & Permanent and vice versa?  This did not happen by coincidence.  Clearly, there was contact between the two financial institutions so that it would happen.The Minister stated that an investigation is under way and that if criminal activity is involved, it will be pursued to finality and rightly so.  Does he have a suspicion criminal activity was taking place?  It is normal in the financial world that inter-bank transfers take place but, given his comment that if criminal activity is involved he will pursue it, does he have a suspicion, assumption or perception, or have some of those officials brought to his attention an indication that criminal activity might well have been involved, and in what circumstances would that happen given the back-to-back transfer?This was the subject of an incorporeal decision by the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach was inJapan and was in constant contact with the Minister of Finance, or at least this is what I understand from newspaper reports.  When was the Green Party informed of the eventual decision to arrive at a decision for nationalisation?  Was the entire Cabinet up to date on this matter?In the context of the nationalisation, the Minister has said he did not have the full picture.  Why was the House not informed of the extent of the picture he had?  This is why people outside the House say this is a continuation of business as usual and protection of what was there.  It is the Minister's job to smash that wide open in terms of transparency and accountability, and to prove to the people of the country that there will be no cover-ups during his time as Minister for Finance.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	773	A number of good questions have been put by Deputy Kenny which give me the opportunity to put matters on the record of the House.  First, there was a Cabinet meeting which arrived at the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  The various newspaper reports that it was a purely incorporeal meeting are inaccurate.  The matter was of some urgency and the Taoiseach was in Japan but a meeting of the Cabinet took place and was presided over by the Tánaiste.  A number of Ministers were present and at all stages our colleagues in Government from the Green Party participated in these decisions and were fully informed of them.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	774	Did they know about the €7 billion?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	775	I dealt with that matter earlier.  The decision, therefore, was not an incorporeal decision of the Cabinet.  It was a full decision of the Government but, naturally, the Taoiseach was kept apprised of developments in the matter up to the time of the Cabinet meeting.In regard to the suggestion of criminal activity, I was speaking in regard to corporate malpractice generally in Anglo Irish Bank, not specifically in regard to this particular transaction.  Even at this stage I have no evidence before me of any suggestion of criminal culpability in regard to this transaction.  In regard to the loan transactions, I have no evidence, even at this point, that there was criminal activity disclosed in that regard.In regard to the acquisition of shares by a bank where the acquisition is financed by the institution — by the company itself — otherwise than lawfully, and there are circumstances where it can happen lawfully, then clearly, were that to have happened, there could be an issue of criminal liability.  I want to put on the record of the House that I am not suggesting there is any information to hand at this stage that suggests criminal activity in regard to this transaction.  However, I reassured the House in response to the question put by Deputy Ó Caoláin that if criminal conduct is disclosed, it is dealt with and I outlined the machinery for dealing with it.In regard to the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deputy Kenny will be aware, having served as a Minister, that officials brief Ministers extensively on reports.  I was briefed extensively by my officials on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, not just on one occasion but on several occasions before meeting various institutions, including this institution.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Will the Minister explain why he decided to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank when he learned of these irregular loans, rather than deciding on the opposite course of action and allowing the bank to wind down?  Many of us believe that would have been the correct action to take.The Minister says there is no culpability but there were very serious goings on, of which he was aware.  Why did he not wait for the outcome of those reports before deciding to nationalise?What is the current status of the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act given the Minister withheld information from the Dáil in regard to very important matters at the time of the Dáil debate?  Is that Act now open to constitutional challenge as a result of his withholding that information from the Dáil?The Minister alluded to my colleague's question.  When did the Minister inform the Government members of his coalition partner about these irregularities in Anglo Irish Bank?  Was it before or after they agreed to proceed to nationalisation that they were aware of this toxic and irregular activity?Are there further toxic announcements to come in regard to this or any other bank?  Perhaps the Minister will explain whether he is aware we are the laughing stock of Europe because of all of these activities.  When we compare and contrast the reaction of the State to these people to that of the American authorities to Enron——

I worked my way through substantial parts of it and, to be honest, there were large parts of it which I wanted to forget because they contained details about individual customers of the relevant financial institutions.I refer to the questions posed by Deputy Morgan.  The Deputy should stop this business of saying that the bank should not have been nationalised.  Whatever the future of the bank, it had to be nationalised to protect the stability of the financial system.  There was no other option.  If we had taken the course of action advocated by Deputy Morgan, that is, to immediately wind up the institution, Ireland would have immediately taken a hit of many billions of euro throughout companies, banks, individual customers, hospitals and credit unions.

The Government attempted to maintain this institution as a going concern on a capitalised basis with 75% control by the State.  That did not command market confidence.  In the absence of that measure commanding market confidence and in the possession of information concerning the fragility of its liquidity and corporate governance issues which had arisen, the best course was to recommend to Government the nationalisation of the institution.  I have not heard any alternative course advocated on the other side of the House that would have secured the interests of the people, the economy, jobs in the country and the taxpayer to any greater effect.

Will the Minister place the report in the Oireachtas Library now that the Anglo Irish Bank has been nationalised and is, therefore, the property of the people?  At least, the House should have the privilege of examining it.  The Minister stated that following nationalisation he brought to the attention of the board the issue of the €7 billion.  Is it not strange that the first time the Minister decided to act on the matter was following the nationalisation?  His officials had referred the matter to the Financial Regulator already, some three or four months earlier.  Was the Minister in possession of a report from the regulator, prior to appearing before the House, regarding the proposals to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, that might have been relevant to the Members of the House before they voted on the matter?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I agree with Deputy Kenny that the Minister's integrity is not in question.  I imagine he is over-stretched, as are his officials.  However the Minister has put himself at risk with the answers provided to the House this afternoon.  We are both agreed that the reason the Minister took his stated position on 29 September was because of the rumours that were rife concerning Anglo Irish Bank, the crashing share price and the knock-on effects of these on the banking system.  In any case, that is what the Minister told the House.  Then, the Minister was unable to answer certain questions and he informed the House he engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to find out the answers.  Now, it seems he is telling the House that when he received the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, he read extensive tracts, but not this particular tract.  He seems to be saying this matter was not considered a risk factor.The Minister must explain to the House how his officials came to that conclusion.  How did the officials decide that this matter ought immediately be referred to the Financial Regulator, but kept from the Minister for Finance?  How could the Minister's officials decide to conceal this critical information from him?  How could the Minister regard what Deputy Burton has described as this Enron-style ruse at deception as just another customer that he would like to forget about?  The Minister had no wish to race through the pages of the report naming the bank's customers.  He preferred to forget them.  How could he forget this one?  The Minister must attempt to explain to the House a second time how he has risked so much taxpayers' money in rescuing this bank in circumstances in which he initially did not bother to read the relevant section of the report, and then when he did become aware of the position, he proceeded anyway with the measures to nationalise the bank.I cannot understand how the Department could have acted in this way, given the anxiety that must have awaited the completion of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  The Department must have been very keen to read its contents and its conclusions, to determine whether the bank was solvent, to ascertain the loan to deposits ratio, and other critical questions.  However, the officials decided to refer this critical question to the Financial Regulator, but not to the Minister and kept the details from him.  Can the Minister explain this?

However, I will first address Deputy Costello's questions.  As I indicated in my reply, I instructed my officials that the new board should deal with this matter.  To date we have not received a report from the Financial Regulator on this matter.  Deputy Costello will appreciate that the old board of Anglo Irish Bank stayed in operation until the institution was nationalised by the Houses.  The old board was in existence until the President signed the legislation and a new board was constituted by the Government.  That was a new board, distinct from that which existed for most of the month of January.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	806	Mr. O'Connor, who became chairman in late December, liaised with my Department on the matters under discussion and they were brought to my attention.  He was dealing with these matters.  However, there was considerable uncertainty about the corporate future of Anglo Irish Bank until the nationalisation Bill was enacted.  I advised my officials to raise the matter with the board members upon their entry into office.  It was my responsibility as Minister for Finance to appoint a new board once the bank was nationalised.  I am trying to explain that the context in which the question is asked is not quite relevant.

He raised the question of the meeting on 29 September and the Government decision to guarantee the banking system.  There was a concern on 29 September that a nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank would have a knock-on effect on the entire banking system, because of the very critical liquidity position of all the banks that evening.  The approach to the Taoiseach and me regarding the guarantee was made by the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of Ireland and the Allied Irish Banks.  I put that on the record of the House in the course of the guarantee debates.  I received no representations whatsoever from the Anglo Irish Bank about the extension of a guarantee to it, or about its possible nationalisation at that time.

That was the sole occasion since my appointment as Minister for Finance on which I met Mr. FitzPatrick.  I met him, of course, on two subsequent occasions, after 30 September, with my officials, to discuss the future of the institution.It is important to recall the focus of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  It was a due diligence exercise on the loan quality of financial institutions but naturally inquiries were made in this report of other features.  This was another feature which emerged and was viewed and described in the report as an issue.  It was not listed in the report as a risk factor.  When I told the House a few minutes ago that this was not viewed as a risk factor that was what was stated in the report.  It was described simply as an issue to be pursued and my Department did pursue it.  That was written in the report.  Did the Deputy have another query about nationalisation and proceeding with nationalisation?

It was not even expressly identified as a risk factor in the report.  When the offer was made to Anglo Irish Bank, however, in respect of the €1.5 billion, that was on the basis that the State would continue with the due diligence process with a more extensive and intrusive investigation into the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank covering deposits as well as the loan book and all the other features of the institution.  At the conclusion of that due diligence my officials advised me about this issue.  It was one of the issues which I took into account in recommending to my colleagues that the institution should be nationalised.It is important to remember that the due diligence, which was instituted after the offer to capitalise Anglo Irish Bank for a 75% return, focussed on the deposit base as well as the loan book of the bank.

Does the Minister agree that this was done for no reason other than concealment?  I cannot understand how it was not highlighted as a major risk issue in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  We would like to see that report.This Minister found and pored over the Anglo Irish Bank report in respect of the director's loans for Seán FitzPatrick.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report that the Minister commissioned is 120 pages long.  It was like the Holy Grail.  I would have thought the Minister would have wished to read the report in depth.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	838	I am examining whether it will be possible, in respect of the bank in which the State is a shareholder, to publish the maximum amount possible, consistent with the protection of the necessary confidentiality which must exist between a customer and a bank in an institution which we now own, and to do that when the annual report is published.The report contains 120 pages on each of the financial institutions.  I was briefed extensively on it.  The focus was on the quality of the loan books because understandably, our concern was to ensure what exposures arose in the institutions there in terms of our guarantee.  The deposit issue was noted but described as an issue to be taken up by the Department and was so taken up.  I cannot give the House a finalised view on the reason for the transaction today.  It is clear that there were major liquidity support operations mounted between institutions in the past year but to the extent that this may have gone beyond that activity it is a serious matter and will require a comprehensive explanation from the parties concerned.  Those investigations are ongoing and I cannot prejudge them.On a more constructive note, I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that it is of fundamental importance that we reform the regulatory system.  I will listen to all sides of the House in the progression of that reform.  The current architecture and system did not serve the country well when it entered this financial crisis.  The arrangement which was arrived at, whereby the Central Bank was co-located with the Financial Regulator but each operated autonomously, does not appear to have served the country well in recent months and years.  It is known in the public domain that the Central Bank assessed the dangers of excessive lending long before the regulator but was unable to force its will in that regard.  There has always been a demand for a separate system of financial regulation because of the fear that a central bank would be concerned primarily with prudential considerations but whatever may have happened, it is essential that we devise a structure that commands public confidence for the future.  Many of the decisions that will have to be taken in that regard relate to men and women, rather than measures, but measures may be required as well.

The replies that he has given to us this afternoon raise the most serious questions about his performance in his office, and the most serious questions about his future in that office.

The State has given an extraordinarily generous guarantee to the banking system.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to examine the financial state of the banks and what we had got ourselves into.  It beggars belief that the Minister did not read the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, even if one accepts that he was very stretched on time during the period concerned.  It is unbelievable that he would not have read the section of the report about Anglo Irish Bank, and that we have ended up in a situation——-

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	843	He did say that.  He stated that he did not read what was in the report about this loan, and that it was not drawn to his attention.  He said that his officials reported it to the Financial Regulator but did not bring it to his attention.  He told us that this report came before his Department in October and that he did not know about this loan until January.  He has explained why.  We know that he did not inform the House about this loan before the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Did he inform the Government about the existence of this loan before it made the decision to approve the legislation to nationalise the bank?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	844	I answered the question on the report already.  The Deputy chose to misconstrue my reply and state that I had not read the sections relating to Anglo Irish Bank.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	846	I stated that I had not read the entirety of the report, which contained 120 pages on each of six financial institutions, that I had been briefed extensively by my officials on it, that I had met the author of the report and that the matter was listed in the report as an issue to be addressed by the Department, and not a risk factor.  Naturally, my concern was directed at risk factors, as should be the case for any Minister for Finance and as pointed out by the Deputy in the opening preamble to his questions.  In looking at a 720 page report on the Irish banking system, a Minister for Finance will focus on risk factors.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The Deputy was concerned about the position of the guarantee and the issues were supplemented by very generous and extensive briefings by my officials on this matter.  When the matter was drawn to my attention in January, I took a decision to recommend to my colleagues that we should nationalise this institution, which I believe was the correct decision.  Deputy Gilmore cannot point to a cent of taxpayers' money that has been wasted as a result of the decisions I have taken in this whole matter.  His party characterised the guarantee as a generous one.  The taxpayer has received money for the guarantee.The Labour Party decided not to support the guarantee so that Deputy Gilmore can quietly go around the country saying that the Government is bailing out the banks and not worrying about anything else.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I understand that the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance were aware from late 2007 and early 2008 of the issues relating to Seán Quinn and that there were grave concerns about the Quinn family group of companies and the contracts for difference.  However, there were also difficulties with Anglo Irish Bank and the fact that it was being problematic.  Would the Minister confirm that those difficulties became acute and that he was briefed on them by his officials on taking office?  In that context, when he asked us in the Dáil on 29 September — the day before Anglo Irish Bank's year end, as I pointed out then — to guarantee €440 billion of deposits, was there somebody somewhere in the bowels of the Civil Service, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Central Bank or the Government who cast an eye over the quality of those deposits, as well as the quality of the assets and the lending to construction firms for development?The amount involved was €7 billion.  It seems to have come in two lumps of €3 billion and €4 billion.  Did they amount to 3% of the bank's commercial deposits?  They did not come from ordinary customers.  The Minister stated that Anglo Irish Bank put money in Irish Life & Permanent.  Did that, therefore, also create a deposit of €7 billion in Irish Life & Permanent to inflate that bank's balance sheet?  That money went bank onto the balance sheet of Anglo Irish Bank through a company of Irish Life & Permanent.  Who owned this company or what was the company vehicle?  How come the board of Irish Life & Permanent received €7 billion and then a company connected to Irish Life & Permanent — possibly a subsidiary — sent the money back?  That actually amounts to €14 billion which was guaranteed that week by the Government.  Did the Minister not actually check that?He did not read the report in full.  Why was the report on Anglo Irish Bank not red letter reading?  This was the bank about which everybody was most worried.  Why did the Minister not sit down and read the report, and then have a thorough briefing on every angle from his officials?  We know he was under pressure, but this was the bank that set all the alarm bells ringing.

When was a copy of the report given to the Taoiseach?  Did he get a separate copy of the report?  The world is in a financial crisis, as is our country.  The Minister has plenty of advisers to brief him, but the buck stops with him.  Does he think it is credible that he did not read every one of those 720 pages?  There is no excuse for him not to have done so, because that is what he is paid to do.  Regardless of the personal pressure that was on him at a time of crisis, the Minister did not do his job.  He has brought his position as Minister for Finance into absolute disrepute.  As a result, does he not think he should consider his position as a member of the Government?

His party members were involved in this matter for one hour and 20 minutes and all the Chair can do is facilitate the Members by allowing the question. The Chair did so and allowed several Private Notice questions.  The debate took much longer than is normal in these circumstances because I continued to allow Members ask questions.  There was a considerable amount of repetition and I regret that Deputy Gilmore is aggrieved.  That is all I can say.

Following further interdepartmental consultation and discussions with legal advices since then, it was decided during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad that a further technical drafting amendment be made to copperfasten the provision.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	995	The grouping includes amendments that relate to the new register of charities.  It is recognised that the establishment and maintenance of the register will give rise to costs.  The purpose of amendment No. 13 is to allow greater flexibility in the future in terms of maintaining the register of charities.  The amendment specifically seeks to give the authority, when directed by the Minister, options to use material from other relevant electronic data bases, including any that have been or are being supported in whole or in part by public funds in maintaining the register.By way of background, over the past two years my Department has provided funding, together with the EU and a number of philanthropic sources, towards a feasibility study to establish whether it might be possible to set up a GuideStar Ireland.  For those Deputies who may be unfamiliar with the concept, GuideStar is founded upon the provision of an extensive, free searchable web data base of all non-profit organisations in a country.  It is constituted as a non-profit entity in all countries where it has been established or is in development.  These include the USA, the UK, Canada, Israel and Germany.  In countries where they are established, GuideStars are regarded as the authoritative source of information about the entire non-profit sector.  This would include the charity sector.This amendment seeks to ensure there will be no impediment preventing the authority, under direction of the Minister, from engaging with an external data provider such as a future GuideStar Ireland with regard to the provision of material to assist in maintaining the register of charities.  Although there is no certainty that a GuideStar Ireland, or similar project, will proceed, or that there will be any public money available for such a venture, it would be remiss for the legislation not to provide for the possibility of such an arrangement, particularly were it to be the case that public funds had been expended on the potential source of data.  The legal advice to me is that the most direct way to ensure this is to include a provision for an appropriate direction for the Minister to the authority.  I stress that such a direction would only apply with regard to the maintenance of the register of charities.  I believe this amendment will ensure efficiency, value for money and better joined up Government in the future.Amendment No. 18 is a technical amendment clarifying that section 39(4) applies only to applicants under that section and not to charitable organisations deemed under section 40 which will not have to go through the application process as set out in section 39.  Throughout the consideration of this Bill in the Houses of the Oireachtas we have looked consciously at ways to ensure that the administrative burden imposed by the legislation does not prove unmanageable, especially for smaller charities.  It is recognised that on application for registration charities must file a comprehensive list of documentation.  The amendment I introduced in the Dáil to deem existing charities as automatically registered goes a long way towards alleviating the registration burden for existing charities.However, although I consider that larger charities, in particular, should provide the range of information listed, I recognise that smaller charities, or particular categories of charity, may have difficulty in fulfilling this requirement.  With this in mind I propose amendment No. 20 and the related, necessary technical amendment, No. 19, under which the authority, with the consent of the Minister, can reduce the number of documents that particular charities are required to file on registration.  This Seanad amendment was welcomed by the charities sector and I commend it to the House.Seanad amendments Nos. 21 and 22 both correct cross-references to other sections of the Bill that should have been made following previous amendments.

Arising from the funding the Department and Europe have been providing, will these databases be available to the public so that at any time people can go to their computers and see who is registered and who is not?

In current times there is no guarantee that such a situation will occur but it would be remiss of us not to take the opportunity to include it in the primary legislation.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	Seanad amendments Nos. 24 to 29, inclusive, 31 and 32 are related and may be discussed together.Seanad amendment No. 24:Section 40: In page 31, lines 14 to 18, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:"(2) The Authority may request the Revenue Commissioners to provide it with all such information in the possession or procurement of the Revenue Commissioners, relating to a charitable organisation to which subsection (1) applies, as the charitable organisation would be required to provide to the Authority were it making an application under section 39.(3) Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law, the Revenue Commissioners shall comply with a request under subsection (2).”.This grouping includes amendments related to the deeming of current CHY holders.  Amendment No. 24 to section 40 is a technical amendment.  Under the existing working it might be interpreted that the Revenue would be required to provide all the information it holds for each organisation deemed to be registered under section 40.  This amendment clarifies that the Revenue will have to provide only information that would normally be required of charities registering under section 39 of the Bill.  They would be dealt with in the same way whether they are deemed or registering.Seanad amendment No. 25 clarifies that the subsection refers to information received by the authority following a request to the Revenue under section 40(2) or a requirement placed by the authority on a charity under section 40(3).  Seanad amendments Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive, and 31 are similar drafting amendments which provide that charities which have registered under section 39 and which have been deemed to be registered under section 40 are regarded as exactly the same in legislation.  Seanad amendment No. 32 requires the authority to notify in writing a body that is being removed from the register because it has a disqualified trustee.  Previously there was no such obligation.

In one sense the Deputy has jumped ahead slightly to the next amendment which gives more detail on the grounds on which they might be removed.  Seanad amendment No. 32 is to specify that the body must be notified in writing.  The next Seanad amendment No. 32 relates more specifically to the point Deputy Ring is raising.

Seanad amendment No. 33 is a presentational amendment.  Rather than showing a lengthy list of subsections to which the provision does not apply, it shows a much shorter list of subsections to which it applies.  Section 45 subsections (3) and (4) set out the circumstances under which a deemed charity that has been removed from the register may appeal the decision.  Seanad amendments Nos. 34 and 35 combine those two subsections into a single section for presentational purposes.  Seanad amendments Nos. 36 and 37 are very similar.  They clarify that the charity appeals tribunal may impose binding conditions on either the authority or the appellant when making its determinations.

These amendments update or clarify certain cross-references as necessary.  These cross-references result from some previous amendments we made.  Seanad amendment No. 38 corrects a mis-reference in the subsection.  The reference is being corrected to refer to subsection (2), which is the main offence provision under section 48 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil.Section 55(1) of the Bill as passed by the Dáil lists the circumstances under which a person may be disqualified from being a charity trustee.  Seanad amendment No. 51 clarifies that a disqualification under section 55(1) shall not apply where the High Court makes an order that the person may hold the position of charity trustee.  However, if any of the circumstances in section 55(1) apply after the making of such an order, the trustee shall, again, be disqualified.Seanad amendment No. 61 is a redrafting amendment.  It clarifies that it applies to a direction given by the authority under section 51(2), unlike the other sections referred to where there is no provision for the authority to give a direction.  Seanad amendment No. 73 clarifies the particular subsection of section 91 to which the particular provisions apply where it previously just referred to the section.

Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are linked.  They effect no substantive change to the provision.  The reference to subsection (3) is simply being moved within the subsection.  This subsection provides that even though a charity may be below the audit threshold designated by the Minister, the authority may direct the charity to have its accounts audited if it considers it appropriate.  We discussed that earlier.  The existing reference to subsection 50(2) of the Bill as passed by the Dáil is incorrect.  It is not possible for a charity to contravene section 50, subsection (2), but it is possible for a charity to contravene section 50, subsection (3) by not having its accounts audited or examined.  Subsection (3) is therefore the correct cross-reference and is inserted by amendment No. 43.Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 are very similar.  Amendment No. 44 clarifies that the authority may only seek to recoup expenses incurred where the authority itself directly appoints an auditor and not where the authority directs a charity to appoint an auditor.  Similarly, amendment No. 45 makes it an offence for a charity trustee to fail to co-operate with an auditor appointed by the authority under section 50(5) or section 50(6).  Previously, it was also an offence for a trustee to fail to co-operate with an auditor appointed by the charity on the direction of the charity under subsection (4).  However, it is already an offence under subsection (12) for a charity or charity trustee to contravene a requirement of the authority under subsection (4), so the original reference in that case was unnecessary.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 as passed by the Seanad, which I am putting before the Dáil today, allow the Minister to prescribe the information to be included in annual reports submitted by charities and set out in more detail what the Minister may prescribe under the regulations in this regard.  These amendments already passed by the Seanad provide sufficient flexibility and control with regard to annual reports to be submitted by charities.  I do not think it is necessary, as envisaged in Deputy Ring's amendment, to oblige all charities to declare in their annual reports that they are actually charities or that they are of a voluntary nature and not commercial entities.  Under the legislation as already drafted, the authority will have the power to request such statements from individual charities if it is considered necessary.  Basically, the provisions of the legislation already ensure that only charities may be registered on the register of charities.  To this end, the legislation defines charitable organisations quite explicitly.  This definition does not require all charities to be voluntary in nature.  Some charities are run by paid professionals.With regard to Deputy Ring's concerns about charities becoming commercial entities, section 2, subsection (b)(ii) specifies that the property of a charity must be expended in pursuit of its charitable purposes, except for necessary expenses entailed by the running of a charity.  The authority will have extensive control and inspection powers.  Therefore, if bodies are on the register they must, under the legislation, fulfil all the criteria for being a charity and have no need to restate this in their annual reports.  Furthermore, to ensure that charities on the register do not change or lose their charitable nature or status after they have registered, section 39(10) obliges charities to notify the authority of any changes to the object of the charitable organisation or trust concerned which might affect its charitable status.  It would be an offence for charities not to do so, and a person guilty of an offence under the legislation would be liable to hefty fines, substantial prison sentences or both.  In these circumstances, I cannot accept Deputy Ring’s amendment.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1015	I am disappointed the Minister will not accept my amendment.  The reason I tabled this amendment is the concern among the general public about the charities to which they are subscribing.  I wished to ensure the transparency, correctness and openness of any organisation with charitable status.  We need to clarify what salaries are being paid by charities to their directors, identify whether organisations are acting on a voluntary or a commercial basis, and ensure that if there are changes in status they are notified to the regulator.  People are concerned that some organisations are more businesses than charities and that the charities get very little money from the revenue collected, which goes to pay directors or people collecting on behalf of the charity.  That is why I was hoping the Minister would accept my amendment.  In this way, at the end of every year we would know what is paid to every director.  We want to know about bonuses, salaries and expenses, and how much money is going to the charity itself.  I am concerned about this.Since this Bill was introduced the Minister has agreed to consider many of the concerns expressed by Members on this side of the House, although the Labour Party Members are not here currently, both when the Bill was introduced and on Committee Stage, and he has done so.  The Minister brought the Bill to the Seanad and dealt with many of these concerns.  I was hoping he would accept this amendment as we want people out there to know that the money collected is going to a charity rather than towards large salaries.

However, I was conscious of the fact that not all charities are fully voluntary and that some have paid professionals.  I take the point made by the Deputy.  If the charitable purpose of an organisation changes there is an onus on it to make those known to the authority.  Amendment No. 49 provides for the Minister to prescribe the information to be included in the annual report into a new subsection and sets out, in greater detail than had previously been the case, what the Minister may prescribe under the regulations.  The Deputy's concern is already dealt with in the legislation and for this reason I cannot accept his amendment.

They did not change the subsection in any substantive fashion.  It will still be an offence for a charity trustee or employee to comply with a direction from a person not qualified to act as a charity trustee unless the person has reasonable grounds for not knowing that the person was not so qualified.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1020	The matter of the position of auditors of charities was raised by Senator O'Toole in the Seanad and Deputy Ciarán Lynch in the House on Report Stage.  The concerns were that the Bill would allow charity trustees to audit their charities.  This was not the Government's intention.  Instead, the aim was to ensure that where independent auditors of charities were party to offences that such auditors would be regarded as charity trustees in terms of having committed an offence under the Bill and could be prosecuted on that basis.I fully share the view that a charity trustee should not audit his own charity.  This is reflected in section 187 of the Companies Act 1990, under which an officer or servant of a company must not also be its auditor.  On reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the provision as it previously stood had the potential to place an unreasonable burden on independent auditors and one that is unnecessary, as auditors are already subject to statutory obligations.  I thank Senator O'Toole and Deputy Lynch for their constructive contribution on the issue.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	The amendment emerges from a desire to ensure that the new regulatory regime operates in an efficient way, allowing for the sharing or pooling of resources where possible to ensure value for money and to avoid unnecessary duplication.  In this context, it is recognised that there is already in existence a number of appeals structures across several regulatory regimes and that it may be possible for the new charity appeals tribunal to avail of existing resources and facilities in carrying out its statutory role, which would reduce overheads and lead to a more streamlined process.  This amendment provides for that possibility and is consistent with the principles of better regulation.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	The previous amendment referred to auditors not being able to do their own accounts.  We do not want this legislation, the regulator and the regulator's office to cost a fortune.  We raised this on Second and Committee Stages.  We must streamline this area as much as possible, use whatever Government agencies and resources are available and not have the charities or the taxpayer obliged to pick up the tab where that is not necessary.  I hope the Minister will streamline it and that the regulator will be instructed when he or she is appointed to ensure that costs are taken into account, particularly in the current climate.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1023	During the passage of the Bill through both Houses I noticed there is great appreciation of the vital role that trustees play in the operation of charities.  I am also aware of the need to protect the interests of trustees of charities.  I wish to ensure that they are not made unfairly liable for commitments they enter into in good faith on behalf of charities.  I also wish to ensure that those engaged in charity work can undertake the role of trustee without being worried that this role might have negative financial implications for them.I have already amended the Bill to enable charities to use charitable funds to indemnify trustees against personal losses arising where there they have acted in good faith.  In the Seanad, the Opposition Senators welcomed the insurance provision.  However, it was considered that there might be a high cost involved in taking out such a policy, particularly where potential liabilities might be considerable.  Accordingly, Senators submitted amendments relating to trustee liability.  I agreed to reflect on the matter and did so in consultation with the office of the Attorney General.  My advice was that a trustee could only be personally liable where there is a breach of the fiduciary relationship by the trustee with the consent of the trustees.  Where a trustee acts in good faith in carrying out its business with a body such as a statutory body, there is really no way the trustee would be personally liable.Nonetheless, to remove doubt, I decided to table an amendment to deal with the issue raised by allowing the court to grant relief to charity trustees from personal liability for a breach of trust, where the trustees acted honestly and reasonably in good faith.  I am confident this will offer reassurance to those who act as trustees to charities or who are contemplating such a role.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1024	I agree with this amendment.  People give their time free to charities.  In any organisation people can make mistakes.  Nobody should be personally liable if they are doing something in a voluntary capacity.  It is not easy at this time to get people to work on behalf of charities.  Their home, family or livelihood should not be put at risk if they make a genuine mistake.  There should be some insurance coverage from the charity and it should come from the funds.  The person should not be out of pocket when they are giving their time, effort and commitment to the charity.

The concern was raised that trustees could not leave themselves exposed and liable.  There is the option of insurance to indemnify them but there is also this new section which relates to trustees who have acted honestly, reasonably and in good faith to ensure that they would not be liable.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	The Bill is designed to enhance the security of both cash and non-cash collections and thus bolster public confidence.  To this end, the Bill provided that cash collectors must use a sealed box.  This was intended to address the open bucket method, which can give rise to concerns about the security of the collection.  However, this gives rise to concerns in the charity sector that were reflected in the Seanad debate.  The concern was that the provision did not accommodate collectors giving change to donors where fixed price tokens were sold.  Deputy Ring raised this matter late in the debate and I assured him we would try to deal with it.  He mentioned Daffodil Day and other collections.  It got a further airing in the Seanad and these amendments are the response.While the Bill is intended to enhance security, it is not intended to unduly hinder collectors or to discourage potential donors from purchasing a token because the collector could not provide change.  The approach needed was to allow for exceptions to be made to the sealed box rule without compromising the general principle behind it.  I took legal advice on the issue and Seanad amendment No. 70 will allow the authority some discretion in applying the sealed box provision, which is the principle behind these amendments.With regard to Seanad amendments Nos. 71 and 72, I propose to amend, on the basis of legal advice, the original Government amendment that was made to this subsection in the Seanad.  The Street and House to House Collections Act 1962 applies to collections undertaken by both charities and non-charities.  In framing amendments relating to collections by charities, it is important that we do not impose obligations on non-charities that they cannot meet.  Under the original amendment made in the Seanad, even non-charities would have been required to have their registered number on their collection boxes.  However, as only registered charities will be allocated a registered number by the new authority, it would have been impossible for non-charities to meet such a legal requirement.  On the basis of legal advice, therefore, I am removing this obligation in the case of non-charities, although they will still be required to have their name displayed on collection boxes.In addition, the Bill currently provides that charities are required to display the charitable purpose for which the collection is being held on the charity collection boxes and on garments worn by non-cash charity collectors.  The sector made representations to the effect that were the charitable purposes to change, for example, were a charity to hold a collection in respect of a natural disaster in one country followed by another collection in respect of another disaster in another country, under the Bill as currently drafted the charity would have to purchase new garments or collection boxes which would give rise to additional costs.  I do not wish to impose any additional compliance costs on charities where these can be avoided.  The revised amendment No. 71 and amendment No. 72, therefore, remove the requirement to show the name of the particular charitable purpose for which the collection is being held on the charity collection boxes and on garments worn by non-cash charities' collectors respectively, although charities will be still required to display their name and their registered number.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	I compliment the Minister of State, who is correct.  Late in the day this problem arose when we were contacted by a number of charities which were concerned about the sealed boxes.  I compliment the Minister of State on introducing the necessary amendment and dealing with it.  As he stated, people make a donation and want to get change back.  He dealt with it effectively.  I support the amendment.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	I consider it key to this legislation that organisations that are not charitable in nature should be prevented from presenting themselves to the public as charitable.  I want to be sure that donors to charity can be sure that their donation for the benefit of a good cause is not diverted for personal profit.  In this context I am very aware of the disquiet that both Deputies and Senators have expressed about those pre-signed mass cards sold in shops and not obtained from or with the consent of the Catholic church.There was no doubt that the pre-signed mass cards are widely for sale in shops and this practice has given rise to two big concerns.  First, there are fears that these mass cards are often being sold on a for-profit basis with perhaps only a small portion of the purchase price, if any, given to the benefit of the priest or church.  Second, there is a worry that no mass is ever offered in respect of the intention specified on the card.Deputies will be glad to know that I have taken on board the concerns expressed to me on this topic and following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, I am proposing an amendment to the Bill to the effect that anyone who sells mass cards must be able to show that he or she has entered an agreement with the church to do so.  I hope this will set people's minds at rest on the validity and authenticity of such cards.I consider that this measure, combined with the authority's power to provide information to the public through the likes of public information campaigns or guidelines, and also the provisions in the Bill that prevent non-charities from holding themselves out as charities, will help people to identify genuine charities from other organisations which are not charitable in nature.  The church itself will have an important role to play to ensure the success of this approach and I understand that it is committed to playing its part.Deputy Ring and I spoke about this in the Dáil on Report and Final Stages.  I made a commitment we would continue to discuss it with the Attorney General and this is the amendment that we brought to the Seanad.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1036	I tabled an amendment on this on Committee Stage.  I cannot recall whether we put it to a vote, but the Minister gave a commitment that he would examine it.  He has done that and introduced the necessary amendment, which I welcome.Since then I received many representations from people who say that what the Minister of State proposes is unconstitutional.  I want him to assure the House that he has received advice from the Attorney General that this is not unconstitutional and what he is doing is legal and cannot be open to challenge.  I understand he cannot stop anybody from bringing the matter to the High Court and the Supreme Court, as the case may be.Personally, I cannot be hypocritical.  I welcome the amendment.  For years people were concerned about this.  The church itself was being ripped off.  A church report found there were priests who were dead whose signature was being used on mass cards for which money was being collected.  People were paying money to have a mass said and that was not happening.I hope the Minister of State can confirm that he is quite satisfied with the advice that what he proposes is legal and is not open to challenge.

I apologise for not being here earlier; I was at a committee meeting.Much needs to be done in this area and, hopefully, this legislation will address the problems of non-charities purporting to be charities.  Anybody living in Dublin will know the amount of supposedly charitable organisations who are looking for donations, for clothes or whatever.  Hopefully, that will be ended and the charities who are in dire need of the donations will get them.  In this case the church would get the money, as intended, so that it can function properly and is not dependent on the State.People setting themselves up as charities selling mass cards which do not do what they are supposed to do amounts to robbery.  I welcome this amendment and the provisions in the end of this Bill to address these shortfalls.

When the Charities Bill was first mooted, every Deputy was aware of issues related to mass cards, the scams that go on and the malpractice.  It did not prove easy to effect this change.  If it had, we would have accepted amendments earlier.I am not a legal person, but this Bill, and this section, was drafted with the aid of advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  Obviously, I cannot stop a constitutional challenge, but this is not something that a layperson wrote.  It came from the highest legal authority in this State.  I want to assure Deputies of that.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1039	Seanad amendment No. 75 is on the substitute list of amendments circulated on 3 February 2009.  Seanad amendments Nos. 76 to 83, inclusive, are related.  Seanad amendments Nos. 75 to 83, inclusive, will be discussed together.Seanad amendment No. 75:SCHEDULE 1: In page 74, line 2, to delete "15" and substitute "20".
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	I am very conscious that the new charities regulatory authority will face significant challenges.  In addition to its broad regulatory and supportive role, the new authority will also be taking on the complex functions of the Office of Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland, which is to be dissolved.  For this reason the new authority must be able to draw on a wide range of expertise and experience.  In view, therefore, of the complex work that will be undertaken by the new authority, on the basis of the advice of the Attorney General, it is proposed to increase the maximum potential membership of the authority to 20.Amendment No. 75 is intended to ensure that the authority will have available the diverse range of skills necessary to enable it to undertake its broad remit efficiently and effectively.  This will also facilitate the authority in forming committees to which specified decision making may be delegated as the Bill provides.On a related matter in the context of the membership of the authority, the issue of the exclusion of public representatives, and specifically members of local authorities, from the board of the new authority was raised in the Seanad debates.  I suppose Deputy Ring is not surprised the Senators raised that particular matter.However, I seriously reflected on the issue and I can acknowledge the point that people who serve as local authority representatives may well have the skills and experience which could enhance the work of the board of the new authority.  Accordingly, I made those changes on Report Stage in the Seanad and amendments Nos. 76 to 83, inclusive, collectively remove the automatic exclusion of members of the local authorities from membership of the authority in paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 and in consequential paragraphs.  Of course this does not actually mean that councillors will be appointed to the board of the new authority but it will make councillors, with the relevant experience and interest who may have much to offer the new authority, eligible for appointment.I commend these amendments to the House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1041	I want to make two points, the first of which relates to the member of the authority.   The Minister of State is talking about increasing membership of the authority from 15 to 20.  I shall not divide the House today on this, but I hoped that 15 people could do the business necessary in this regard.  Fine Gael wanted the Department to implement this rather than a regulator.  However, this is the one time we need a regulator and a board of 15 people is sufficient.  I know the legislation is very complex as regards this, but I hope it will stay at 15, again given the economic climate.As regards not excluding local authority members, I support that.  Some Senators were very anxious to tell councillors throughout the country that this amendment was accepted by the Minister of State, and in fact I had a good deal of representation from local authority members from all over the country.  Some of them thought they would automatically be on the board, given the way the letters were drafted.  As someone who has come through the local authority system, I make no apology.  If local authority members have the qualifications and the professional background required to be on the board, I see no reason they should be excluded.  As the Minister of State has said, there is no guarantee that they will be on the board, but they should not be excluded, no more than a High Court judge or anybody else who might be entitled to serve, if he or she has the qualifications.I was going to divide the House, but I will accept the amendment, while asking the Minister of State to ensure that the board numbers are kept tight.  The cost factor must be kept down.  We do not want to see another quango getting out of control and not answerable to anybody.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1042	I know the Deputy will not divide the House, but on a point of clarification, as I said in the Seanad, this is an enabling measure which says the authority could comprise as many as 20 members.  That does not mean that it will.  It would be remiss of us not to have that provision and have to come back with further legislation.  However, it is not the intention that the authority will necessarily have 20 to begin with.Just to clarify as regards local authority representatives, the legislation specifies clearly the type of experience the people on the new authority would need to have.  I did not think it appropriate, however, and saw no specific reason simply being a member of a local authority would automatically exclude somebody, and as a consequence I removed that.  The Deputy is right, however.  It does not guarantee anybody a position.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	Before we finish with this Bill I just have a few words for the Minister of State and his staff.  I thank the staff for the co-operation they afforded to me and Deputy Wall.  If there is something in the legislation that we do not see right now that might affect the charities, the Minister of State gave a commitment as regards a review and said that we could come back to it again, in the event.  I ask that we should be allowed to return to the House and make the necessary amendments, should this occur.A man attended my clinic last Monday, and said that people had called to him the week before looking for a charitable donation.  The people were his neighbours and he felt obliged to part with the only €20 he had in the house.  I appeal to the public as regards charities.  We are living in difficult economic times.  People who collect for charities should ensure they are worthy causes.  They should not just think up ideas for collecting for charity.  People are going through difficult times.  Irish people are very decent and will always subscribe when necessary, but they should not be put under pressure.I thank the Minister of State for his kindness and I must say he did a good job.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1044	This has been complex legislation.  We are trying to regulate a system that has been around for a long time and obviously are trying to maintain confidence in the charity sector, with transparency and so forth, without adding undue burden.  It is in that context that we realised at an early stage there would be a requirement for a mandatory review in five years' time.   It has proven to be very complex.  As far as possible we have taken on board as many of the recommendations as we could, from all sides.I thank my predecessors, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern and Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, for bringing this long awaited legislation before the House in the first instance.  Just mentioning two predecessors and myself in this regard will give an idea of the complexity of the legislation.  I also specifically thank Members of the House for their contributions to the debates.  Although we have to return to the Seanad for one brief technical amendment, I particularly thank Deputies Ring and Wall for their personal interest in the legislation and for their contributions to the stages that I have led in the House.  They have been very constructive and helpful and the Bill reflects a genuine effort at co-operation from all sides.I am sure Deputy Ring will join me — and Deputy Wall would if he had not left the Chamber already — in thanking the officials of my Department, in particular Mr. Joe Hamill and Mr. Terry Dunne.  I do not know whether one is supposed to mention the names of officials in the House, but anyway, I want to say it.  Apart from assisting me, they made themselves available to Members on the other side of the House and engaged with the sector as well.  In other words, we were bringing forward informed proposals, trying to reflect what the sector wanted and how we could manage it in that regard.  They were very hands-on and proactive and I would specifically like to thank them here and have their work recognised.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	I totally agree with the Minister of State.

Having to come back here with 83 amendments sounds an enormous task, but that was because of the spirit of co-operation.  It is somewhat unusual to have so many of our own amendments, but that was to try and accommodate people, as far as possible.  The Bill we have passed here today has improved as a result of those changes.

In page 11, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:"(b) including a break-down of the number of persons admitted to practice as barristers or solicitors during that year in terms of gender and socioeconomic background, and”.Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 10 are self-explanatory.  They seek to ensure that the legal profession is reflective of society rather than confined to a single socioeconomic group.  In the past, the profession was confined to men but thankfully in recent years the profile of those who practise law has progressed significantly towards gender balance.  I do not have the figures to inform me whether the profession is reflective of society but, at approximately 51% of the population, women now outnumber men.A presumption exists among the general public that the legal profession is aloof from society.  This is partly the result of the educational obstacles put in the way of those who depend on inadequate maintenance grants to enter the profession.  The legal services ombudsman should be reflective of the general public.  I do not suggest major changes but it is logical in this day and age to ensure fair representation of people from working class backgrounds in order to offer a more varied outlook.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1053	I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for his contribution to the Bill.  He is in effect seeking a quota system for admissions to both parts of the legal profession.  In regard to the gender profile, 46% of practising solicitors and 40% of barristers are women.  Moreover, the majority of law graduates from public and private third level institutions are women.  The proportion of female graduates in 2003 was 65.4%.  The educational requirements of the Law Society and the King's Inns are such that equal opportunity is given to both sexes to enter the legal profession.  I do not agree with a quota system in this regard.  Over the past several decades, both sexes have been given better opportunities to become barristers and solicitors.  The Law Society and the King's Inns have introduced schemes to allow people to take up professional courses by various routes, with the overall result of widening access to the professions among every stratum of Irish society.I recall during my time as a law student in UCD being given a lecture on Roman law by the former Deputy, Fine Gael Attorney General and expert in constitutional law, J.M. Kelly, in which he made some disparaging remarks regarding the fact that the proportion of females in the class was for the first time almost 50%.  He very eloquently stated that the only reason so many females were studying law was because they wanted to find eligible men.  A protest was held as a result of his comments and the remainder of the course in Roman law was boycotted.  Thankfully, however, other students and I passed our examinations in the subject.  During the 1970s, significant numbers of females began to take up courses in law.I understand the Deputy's intention but it would be wrong to introduce a quota system, particularly in view of the substantial numbers of females who are now studying law.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1054	I am unsure whether I was alive at the time of the incident described by the Minister.  I do not agree with the proposal for quotas because the opportunities are now such that people from many different backgrounds can attend public and private law schools to qualify as barristers provided they meet the educational requirements.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1055	I did not suggest quotas solely on the basis of gender representation.  I acknowledge the significant changes that have taken place in that regard.  My intention was to address the perception to which I referred earlier but I would be happier if another mechanism could be found to ensure the legal profession is more reflective of society.  I do not generally favour quotas but they are needed in certain circumstances where imbalances arise.  They can be subsequently removed provided the will exists to achieve a balance.  In light of the figures set out by the Minister on gender proportions in legal courses, we may in future need to introduce quotas to ensure the adequate representation of males.  I hope that will not be required, however.I will not press the amendment but ask that more be done to address the perception that working class people are not adequately represented in the legal profession.  I know many legal professionals from working class backgrounds who encountered major difficulties in pursuing their chosen careers.

In page 14, line 33, before "the" to insert "subject to section 20(2),”.I would like to give a rationale in respect of amendments Nos. 13, 15, 16 and 17 as they address some of the issues raised on Committee Stage by Deputy Rabbitte.The objective of the Government amendments and Deputy Rabbitte's alternative amendments are in effect the same, namely, to exclude invalid, frivolous and vexatious complaints from the calculation of the levy under section 19.  The issue is how this objective can best be achieved.  Section 20 provides that the detailed provisions for counting and calculating the levy be made by the Minister in regulations to provide for the exclusion of complaints in that section rather than in section 19.  Amendment No. 17 provides for the exclusion of complaints falling within the scope of subsection 22(4).  The net effect is that frivolous, vexatious and other invalid complaints which the Ombudsman declines to investigate or discontinues investigating cannot be counted for the purpose of calculating the levy.Amendments Nos. 13, 15 and 16 are technical cross-referencing amendments consequent on amendment No. 17.

In page 20, line 16, after "manner" to insert "(including by any informal means)".While Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 21 is similar, I will give the rationale in respect of amendment No. 20.  Section 23 was examined in the light of the Committee debate on the matter of resolution of complaints by the Ombudsman.  I agreed with the views expressed then that there would be value in making reference in the Bill to informal resolution of complaints where appropriate.In this regard, amendment No. 20 gives statutory guidance to the Ombudsman to make it clear that he may resolve complaints by informal means if appropriate.  On Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 21, we have moved in his direction in meeting the objective of encouraging informal resolution of complaints where appropriate.  Amendment No. 20 addresses the situation.

However, he does not wish to speak further on the Bill.  I call Deputy Seán Barrett.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1067	The main reason I wish to speak on this legislation is to state my total disagreement in regard to the establishment of another quango.  We have a sufficient number of quangos.  To the best of my knowledge there are more than 1,000 of them.  Every effort is being made, in particular by my party, to put in train procedures to reduce dramatically the number of quangos in existence.There is no need for a national employment rights authority as suggested in this legislation.  Employees' rights are already protected by legislation.  Also, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment incorporates the old Department of Labour.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, who is present in the House bears responsibility for labour affairs and I have full confidence in his being able to carry out his duties in this regard.What is needed is not another quango but a proper inspectorate to ensure that those who suffer at the hands of rogue employers obtain their rights under existing legislation, all of which should be catered for by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The Minister stated that the organisation has delivered on the provision of regional cover with offices in Carlow, Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon.  Even before this legislation is passed, offices have been set up in Carlow, Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon.  What are we doing?  We have massive unemployment, people are going out of business every day and other people are taking massive cuts in wages and salaries while we are setting up a quango, the problems associated with which could be dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  How did we ever get on without all these quangos?  If one puts down a parliamentary question on any of these issues in the future, one will be told the Minister has no responsibility in this area.We must make up our minds whether we are living in a democracy.  Taxpayers do not want this.  Public servants are being asked to carry a massive pension levy, some of which will go to pay unnecessary overheads for offices, staff and all the paraphernalia in five different regions.  It is unbelievable.  There is no necessity to go ahead with this.There is no doubt this was dreamt up at the time of the Gama scandal and I am sure it was a deal done between the Government of the day and the social partners to overcome those difficulties.  While I do not wish to stand over any rogue employers, there is no necessity for this Bill.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the legislation and go back to the drawing board.  If existing legislation needs to be strengthened, it should by all means be done.  I am sure my party would recognise any solid proposals to come forward in this regard.  However, in terms of supporting a quango, the Fine Gael party has no intention of supporting the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority on a statutory basis, and I am delighted about that.Not alone will we set up a quango, the Bill from sections 6 to 31, inclusive, deals extensively with its establishment.  It refers to the setting up of a director; the establishment of the office; superannuation; terms and conditions of employment; the resignation, suspension, removal and disqualification of director; membership of either House of the Oireachtas, European Parliament or local authority; the acting director; the functions of a director; delegation of functions of the director; ministerial policy directions; obligation to consult with the director; power to engage consultants and advisers — the list goes on.  It will be a bonanza of money going out the window.The next heading is a great one — establishment and functions of the advisory board.  Why in God's name do we need an advisory board?  It is bad enough setting up the quango.  This is another outing like the one we had in the FÁS scenario.  It is all to do with jobs for the boys.  At a time when we are trying to convince the public to accept sacrifices to get this country back on its feet, we are setting up a quango for which there is no necessity.The Bill then refers to membership of the advisory board and the terms and conditions of membership.  There is a special section on the chairperson of the advisory board and the next sections concern the annual report and information to the Minister; and a strategy statement.  What strategy statement could there be in respect of this quango?  It then refers to a work programme; accountability of the director before an Oireachtas committee; the director's annual report; disclosure of certain information; co-operation between the director and official agencies.  This is great stuff.  It continues with regard to disclosure of information relating to offences; prohibition on authorised disclosure of information.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1074	I hope all Deputies will see sense.  If enough of us express our honest opinion, the Government will withdraw this Bill.The Bill creates 23 new criminal offences.  The authority will be given the power to impose on-the-spot fines on employers without giving them the chance to rectify any problem.  Employers could face fines of up to €250,000 for failing to keep adequate records, fines of up to €5,000 for other offences and prison sentences of up to five years.  Are we for real?  It does not even distinguish between an employer who employs a small number of people and a large employer with 1,000 staff.Do people understand how difficult it is in this day and age to start one's own small business?  It is hard enough to get the finance to do it but we are then imposing all sorts of obligations on a small employer to have notices everywhere about employees' rights and all of that.  We are not living in the real world.  I want to encourage people to go out and start their own small businesses and, hopefully, expand and give employment to others.Employers have a moral obligation to be fair and reasonable to any employee — that is taken as read and is as it should be.  If some abuse the rights of any employee, there is the Minister of State responsible for a labour affairs and all of the other authorities, including the Rights Commissioner Service, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Equality Tribunal, the Department of Social and Family Affairs in regard to pensions, and the Health and Safety Authority.  We have all of these bodies but we now want to add another layer on to all of this.  People must begin to understand it is difficult with all the red tape to start up a small business and to keep things ticking over.If people are abusing workers, in particular immigrants to this country, and not giving them a fair crack of the whip, there are sufficient laws in place to deal with them.  If the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was to increase the number of inspectors available to investigate issues, that is all that is needed.  We do not need five offices in Carlow, Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon.  We do not need a quango with a whole structure and a head office with all the trimmings, annual reports and consultants — consultants for what?This really is an example of how we can lose the run of ourselves in terms of giving commitments to do things.  At a time when there was plenty, or people thought there was plenty, it was a luxury nobody really thought about.  However, in this day and age, we cannot do that.  To talk about putting people in prison for five years or charging them on-the-spot fines of anything up to €250,000 for failing to keep adequate records is to throw out the baby with the bath water.  It is extraordinary.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, will be able to use powers similar to those of the Garda, the customs authorities and the Competition Authority.  It will be able to enter and inspect a workplace, seal it off, and remove documents.  It does not require any basis to do so.  It can be done on the basis of a complaint.  This is not Russia, it is a democracy and people here have rights.  The fact that one is an employer does not make one a big bad wolf.  We need employers, those who employ one person and those who employ 5,000 people.  We should begin to encourage people into this business and cut out half of the red tape already in place, rather than produce more of it.Some time ago I spoke to a constituent concerning the electrical industry.  There is a new section in the Bill dealing with compliance with registered employment agreements in the electrical contracting industry.  Will the Minister provide a detailed description of what exactly this means?  It is difficult to discern the meaning from reading the Bill.  The person who came to me made a plea for the Minister to do something about another quango, established to collect money and the purpose of which no one seems to know.  Section 45, dealing with compliance with registered employment agreements in the electrical contracting industry covers several pages.  Will the Minister provide a full, detailed account of its purpose and why it is necessary?  It seems that someone thought it would be a bright idea to support another quango.The main purpose for which I am here this evening is to request that the Minister withdraw the legislation.  It is not to condone bad behaviour on the part of any employer against an employee.  We should come back down to earth and realise that there is a Civil Service, with top officials who are quite capable and who have worked for years in this area.  There have been several very good Ministers of State with responsibility for labour affairs who were elected by the people.  They were able to resolve difficulties and problems by encouraging people to discuss them at the negotiating table.  There is also the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which can deal with these matters.All that is necessary is more inspectors.  Let us cut out this nonsense of more offices, directors, quangos, reports and consultants, for which there is no justification.  Let us examine where it is possible to reduce red tape and encourage more employment.  Let us cut out these extra layers of bureaucracy.  There are many agencies already in existence which deal with people's rights.  It is not the case that we are crying out for additional agencies.  Let us be realistic and not discuss shoving people into prison or imposing a fine of €250,000 for not displaying notices.  What message does that send out to someone wishing to start a business?  It does nothing but encourage small businesses into the black economy.A small business person running a plumbing, electrical or carpentry business does not have time to keep all the necessary material for no good reason.  Such people pay taxes, insurance, social welfare and all the other requirements of an employer.  Let them get on with the job rather than create another agency with jobs for various people.  Not alone will newly appointed people have a job in the agency, an advisory board with a chairman and board members will also be established in case anyone is left out.  There are many of jobs for the boys in the thousand quangos already in existence without creating another one.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1075	I welcome the opportunity to make what I suspect will be a brief contribution to the debate and I look forward to saying a good deal more tomorrow.  The Minister will no doubt be interested in the contribution of Deputy Seán Barrett.  The Deputy is aware that I have admired his work for a long time, and that will not change tonight.  However, from listening to his contribution and the relevant and valid points made, the position of the Minister will inevitability be that he is damned if he does, and he is damned if he does not introduce the legislation.The Minister of State pointed out in his introductory speech that NERA was established on an interim basis following the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  We all understand that this took place against a backdrop of much disquiet about the inadequacy of enforcement of employment law standards.  The Minister of State also pointed out that Deputies throughout the House, including me, have raised with him and the Government a range of issues relating to these standards.  He made the famous remark that the Government was condemned for having more dog wardens than labour inspectors and his intention was to remedy that situation.  In fairness to the Minister of State, he has shown a particular interest in these issues, which is important, as the previous speaker will agree I am sure.  The Minister of State must listen to the debate and balance what is right and wrong.I do not suggest the view is held by Deputy Barrett, but I sense there is a view that with the current economic situation it would be very easy for the Department and its inspectors to blink when certain things occur.  However it is important to stress this is not the case.  Before I became a Deputy and a public representative I was always in employment, thank God.  I was involved in the trade union movement and I bring to politics my experiences in that regard.  I can state that I lost my job on three separate occasions.  It was always a very dramatic experience for my family and me.  That recollection brings home to me the importance of good employment and that workers' rights should always be protected.The previous contribution formed an interesting part of the wider debate.  The Minister of State must try to do what is right and uphold the principles of social partnership.  The past two weeks have been difficult for those of us who strongly support social partnership.  Many trade union officials have made that point.  Despite some comment to the contrary, trade union officials have been discussing events with Fianna Fáil Deputies in the recent past.  I have had much interaction with friends in the movement, who have a point of view to express.  When I have an opportunity to make a greater contribution to this debate I will support the concept of ensuring that labour laws are always upheld.  I believe the intentions of the Minister of State will have broad support.  The Minister must make a decision in due course.  I listened when he introduced the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 and recall hearing that he was open and amenable to the comments of the House and to amendments.  I suspect there will be many of these.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1077	We wish to support the motion on the basis that the permutations of the HSE Teamwork-Howarth report for the delivery of care for people in the mid-west will have untold consequences for those who do not live in the region served by Limerick Regional Hospital.  In addressing this motion I wish to speak specifically for the southern region, where the national service plan has been published.  We have also recently received a document from the HSE stating that new efficiencies to the value of €80 million are sought in its operations.  The Teamwork-Howarth report has not been published in the south.  Having read the Fine Gael motion and the prescriptions of the Teamwork-Howarth report for the mid-west, I do not doubt that the delivery of services in the combined Munster region, as espoused in this document, will have a negative effect on hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and Mallow.  While I might be accused of being parochial, it is important to note that the hospital in Mallow is like those in Ennis and Mallow, and to address this as a Munster-wide issue.There has been no politically accountable, coherent analysis of the HSE's proposals.  This is the first time that the House has had an opportunity to properly debate their implications and it is happening on Opposition time.  The Government should make time available to debate the issues adequately so that we can go through the implications of these proposals euro by euro, and hospital by hospital.We have witnessed the erosion by stealth of services at the former county hospital in Mallow.  A CT scanner was put in place a few years ago and became operational last year for approximately ten to 15 hours per week, but now runs for between four and six hours per week.  Last week, we found out that the ear, nose and throat services will be taken away in one fell swoop.  We have also been notified that no children under the age of 16 will be treated within the hospital and that the long-term plan is to replace the accident and emergency unit with a nurse-led minor injuries clinic.The motion notes that between 15 and 30 people are regularly on trolleys for over 24 hours in Limerick Regional Hospital.  If services in Mallow are further reduced the same will apply to Cork University Hospital.  We in the Munster region are arguing for a re-think of the policy.  Clinicians who advise me, and the 120 GPs who serve the hospital, say that there should be no diminution in services in Mallow general hospital until the HSE can guarantee that the services are available in Cork University Hospital.  That is the logic of the argument being applied to Limerick Regional Hospital and to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  There is a complete lack of foresight in the approach to this.  Every time I raise the issue with the upper echelons of the HSE management in the southern region, I meet vague answers and lack of specifics.I do not see how the Minister can dress up the service plan for the southern region as a configuration, or a reconfiguration, because it drives a coach and four through the services being delivered to the catchment areas of Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh.  Those who reside in the catchment areas will have to travel further to get into Cork University Hospital and Limerick Regional which will force more people through a narrow bottleneck.  The services and capacity do not exist within those hospitals.  There is no logic in seeking to further downgrade the satellite hospitals that serve Cork University and Limerick Regional Hospitals.  We want a proper debate on this and I ask that the Government make time available for it.  I appreciate that Fine Gael raised this issue and we support it.How much time do I have left?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13216	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1085	Why are Fianna Fáil Deputies elected by these constituencies allowing this to happen?  Why do those Deputies constantly move to blame it on the HSE?  Are we to believe that Professor Drumm, by virtue of his management of the HSE, is the de facto Minister for Health and Children?  Is there no voice on the Government backbenches from the Munster region served by the hospitals at Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh that will call a halt to what the HSE is trying to do?  If we proceed with the degradation of services at these hospitals there is no way that hospitals such as Cork University and Limerick Regional will be able to deal with the capacity.  That will have untold consequences.The hospital in Mallow serves over 100,000 people in four counties.  I speak to the staff in Cork University hospital and if one visits it on any given day, one will see that the accident and emergency unit cannot cope with the numbers coming through.  Why would the Government seek to further diminish services to the satellite hospitals?We support the motion and believe that if the Government backbenchers who represent constituencies served by the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and Mallow have any backbone they will support such motions because in that way they will support the people.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1088	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the hospital services in the mid-west.   I will concentrate on how the proposed review relates to Limerick city.  I strongly believe that the reforms set out in the report are long overdue.  Ultimately, they will be good for patient outcomes in Limerick.  I also believe that it will not happen overnight and that the change must be incremental.  One cannot go from an imperfect system to a perfect system overnight.  This means we cannot make this into a political football, and it also means involving all of the stakeholders in the process, which will take some time.Everyone in this debate agrees on several matters.  Best practice in the delivery of medical services is changing in Ireland and abroad.  Technology for the delivery of those services is also changing.  That means we must not do things the way we did them before and it also means not doing things in the places we did them before.  It means doing them in different places with better people who are better able to produce better outcomes.  We all agree that the report concludes that if those internationally recognised best practices are implemented, better outcomes will be achieved.  We might disagree on how we go along with this journey, but at least that is a good starting point for all of us.I also welcome the fact that this reform has been led by clinicians, who are the experts on this.  It is not necessarily led by politicians, although it is assisted by them.  It is essentially led by people such as Dr. Paul Burke and Dr. Cathal O'Donnell, who are both highly respected people.  I have met these people on several occasions, and I can say that their sole motivation is the best outcomes for patients.  It is not about turf wars and about keeping practices in some hospitals rather than other hospitals.  Their motivation is simply the best outcome for patients.  Do we accept their good faith and do we work with them in delivering their best expert advice?  I say that we should do so.St. John's Hospital has played a prominent role in recent years in the delivery of services in Limerick.  I believe the hospital is well placed strategically to play a prominent role in the emerging infrastructure in the mid west, following on from this report.  Consultant appointments to the hospital in recent years have been on the basis of a shared commitment with the regional hospital.  In addition, the hospital has participated in joint ventures such as the development of minor injury services in Limerick, and the co-ordination of pathology and radiology services.  That is very welcome.  The initial discussions that began with the management of the hospital about its contribution have been productive.  They are concentrated on providing increased consultant input into the accident and emergency consultant level delivery of services in St. John's Hospital, which is to be welcomed.  The possibility of expanding the scope of the minor injury services in the hospital to cover the weekend period is extremely welcome.The programme of change also includes an expansion in the range of diagnostic facilities, and an expansion of outpatient and day surgery capacity in the smaller hospitals in the region, which includes St. John's Hospital.  A reference in the report has been made for a throughput in the hospital of up to 30,000 people per annum, which is very welcome.  If this report is ultimately delivered, it will be good for St. John's Hospital and the regional hospital.  It will mean a very significant investment in the medical infrastructure in Limerick, an emergency operating theatre in the regional hospital, an expansion of the ambulance service, and a critical new care block in the regional hospital.  That is to be welcomed, but it will not happen overnight.  Everybody needs to work together and we need to take the best advice from the best people with the right motivation at heart, working to deliver the sort of services that Limerick and the mid-west deserve.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	I am not from the region, so I cannot be accused of being parochial.  I rise to support the Minister of State and Deputies from the region who support Government policy.  I do so on foot of what I have heard last evening and again tonight.  I was here for a similar debate ten years ago, which was about the provision of cancer services.  Everything I hear now is a repeat of what happened back then.One of the Opposition Deputies stated that we should support the people, and I accept that.  For five years, I was on the wrong side of the people in my constituency.  When it comes to health issues, there is always a concern for politicians that the people may be right, especially when huge crowds gather to explain how wrong we are.  It is often important to rely upon independent medical advice, especially when we are talking about life and death issues.  It is not for me to be critical of anybody who supports a different point of view, but I would like to make a few points.In the early 1990s I was in the peculiar position of supporting a Fine Gael Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan.  He came out with the national cancer strategy and supported Tullamore as opposed to Portlaoise.  The issues that are being raised today were raised then.  Huge pressure was brought to bear on Opposition Deputies.  I do not quote Members when they are not in the House, but I found it difficult to hear the current Minister criticised by the Fine Gael spokesperson on health, when he stated that what had happened in Portlaoise lay directly at her doorstep.  The Minister is a much greater political thinker than I am, because she did not want to enter that particular debate.  The issue is about the reconfiguration of health services based on the premise of ensuring patient safety in the first instance.  The most important part of the debate back then was that by ensuring a critical mass of people presenting to busy clinical hospitals, the consultants would be upskilled therein, which is the same debate today.The president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland made the point that the college supports this reform.  I find it difficult that the current Minister can be accused of creating difficulties in my hospital, because if Deputies from the Fine Gael-led Government of the 1990s had supported their then Minister for Health and Children, the difficulties we have had in Portlaoise in the past two years would never have occurred.  We are being accused this evening of not listening to the people, but the reality back then is that had we listened to the independent medical advice that has been given today, we would never have had the sorry situation that occurred in Portlaoise.  The centre of excellence would have been in Tullamore and it could not have been used as a political football as it was last night.I want to go back to the Teamwork report, which identified the same issues that occurred in Laois and Offaly ten years ago.  Some Members of the Opposition, especially Deputy Reilly, might want to forget about them.  The Teamwork report identified a number of significant issues relating to how hospital services in the mid-west are organised.  The most important part of the report is that the core specialties of general medicine, general surgery, accident and emergency services and critical care are too fragmented.  This underpins the strategy involved here and the difficulties that were involved when the national cancer strategy was being rolled out.  I must give credit to the Minister, Deputy Harney, for initiating the national cancer strategy that is now working, and now clearly initiating a national cancer strategy for the reconfiguration of hospitals throughout the country.  It is a confirmation of the Government's policy of maximising and improving public health, the cost of which is often a little political pain on the ground.  In the context of the debate in this House, I would prefer to be on the side of those who support patient safety.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1090	I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important Private Members' debate.  There was a time when many public representatives sat on health boards throughout the country.  To be fair, when we were members of health boards, we felt obliged to protect our own patches.  We felt it was our duty to do so.  A change took place when it was felt that politicians should not be involved in making decisions such as that taken by the HSE in this instance.  While many of us did not support that move, in fairness it has removed parochialism from the decision-making process.  We have entrusted the HSE with the running of the health service and the development of our hospital network.  I strongly feel that there is a responsibility on public representatives to ensure that all patients who present themselves at our hospitals enjoy good outcomes.  There is an obligation on every Member of this House to support the development of surgical and emergency medicine.  The Government's decision has been made on the basis of the best medical advice possible.  The many highly regarded medical personnel who have been involved in making the decision to roll out the new strategy for the mid-west region should be given a chance.  Similarly, the report should be given a chance.All of us are concerned to ensure that the necessary resources are available in Limerick Regional Hospital to cope with additional demand when the new regime is in place.  On the basis of what I have seen in the report and heard from the Minister, Deputy Harney, I do not doubt that the resources will be put in place before the system changes.  While people are entitled to have genuine concerns, it is important for them to acknowledge the fact that additional resources will be put in place before additional demands are made of Limerick Regional Hospital.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister and the HSE to ensuring that the additional resources and support services that are required will be put in place.I am extremely proud of Limerick Regional Hospital and its staff.  I have been in public life for many years.  I accept that people have to lie on trolleys for a certain period of time, unfortunately, in hospitals throughout the country.  I respectfully suggest that the alternative is to put a sign on the door of each hospital saying, "sorry, we are full".  With the best will in the world, we cannot do that.  By their nature, hospitals will always have enough patients to fill their beds, regardless of how many they have.  It is a difficult situation.  As one cannot put a "full house" sign on the door, the next best thing one can do is provide trolleys for people to lie on.  We would all prefer if that were not the case.  With the exception of such cases, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of complaints my constituents have made to me about the treatment they have received in Limerick Regional Hospital.  The hospital is absolutely second to none.  On nights like tonight, we should recognise the contribution the hospital's staff members are making.  We often take such matters for granted rather than giving the praise that is deserved.I will be somewhat parochial by mentioning two recent developments in St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastle West, which is the only hospital in my constituency.  The matron and staff of this fine geriatric hospital deserve the height of praise for the manner in which they perform their duties.  Fortunately, in recent times, two capital projects at the hospital — a special dedicated Alzheimer's unit and a special dedicated hospice unit, which will operate in conjunction with Milford Hospice — have been sanctioned.  I call on the Minister to ensure that these two tremendous facilities are opened at the earliest possible date.  I welcome the appointment of a clinical nurse manager at the hospital.  I welcome the confirmation that a person is in place to carry out the manager's duties.  It is important to drive ahead with the opening of the facilities I have mentioned.I fully support the Government's amendment to the Fine Gael motion.  I understand that the changes at the hospitals mentioned in the motion will be implemented step by step.  The hospitals in question, both of which play an important role for the people they serve, will not be closed or downgraded tomorrow.

Many Deputies have highlighted the danger of politicising certain issues, such as health and crime.  It is a common theme.  I am a great defender of politics as a profession.  The influence of politics in the health system is a positive one.  However, there comes a time when we have to acknowledge that the overwhelming weight of clinical evidence and opinion is pointing us in a certain direction.  We should be honest enough to accept that our narrow self-interest needs to be put to one side in favour of a greater interest.  In this case, a greater interest has been identified by clinical leaders in this area.  A similar approach should be taken in other areas of public policy if a clear and strong professional opinion is pointing in a specific direction.  It may not suit our personal interests, but greater interests have to be borne in mind.  Acknowledging the obligation to show moral leadership on certain issues is at the core of politics.All of us have been affected in one way or another by this issue.  In recent years, we have all seen reconfigurations of hospital services in our local areas   It is painful, difficult and hard to put self-interest to one side, but it is necessitated by the greater interests I have mentioned.  Reference has been made to the overwhelming professional opinion in this area.  I would like to refer specifically to the comments made by a consultant surgeon in Limerick, Dr. Burke, on "Prime Time" last Thursday night.  He agreed with the other 12 surgeons in the area that all acute and emergency surgery should be centralised because that would lead to the provision of a safer and better service.  It is clear that Dr. Burke's comments, along with all the other evidence that has been furnished over recent weeks, point us in one direction only — the configuration of services in this area, as suggested by the HSE.  We all have a duty to convince our natural constituencies to follow us on that road.The Minister, Deputy Harney, reminded the House last night that these proposals were first ventilated almost 40 years ago.  The difference now is that we have a Minister who is prepared to tackle the vested interests and face down the narrow self-interest that has unfortunately dogged this country's health policy for too long.  Professor Tom Keane has demonstrated the benefits of centralisation and specialisation.  Anybody who has had to avail of this country's paediatric services will agree that there is no debate in this respect when it comes to paediatric oncology, for example.  We all agree that the centralisation of paediatric services is working.  People do not mind having to travel to Dublin because they know that one of the best paediatric services in Europe is available at a single location there.  That argument has been proven for some time.  We now have the political will to match the strong professional opinion that has prevailed for many years.The Teamwork-Horwath report states that "the core specialties of general medicine, general surgery, A&E and critical care are too fragmented, carry increased risks for patients and staff, and are not sustainable in their present form".  Dr. O'Donnell has said that the extra time taken to get to a specialist service improves survival rates by 25%.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, pointed out, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has added his weight to the argument that substantial reform has to be continued in this area.  It has been suggested that the accident and emergency department in Limerick will be unable to cope with the additional demand on it.  Statistics show that, in January 2009, the number of people who had to wait for long periods of time in the unit was quite small.  They indicate that the department has the capacity to absorb any extra demand that may result from the changes that are being proposed.In regard to the mid-west, an examination of the number of cases presenting in general reveals that in a six-month period Ennis General Hospital had 28 surgical cases and St. John's Hospital had only 21.  Of the 105 emergency cases requiring treatment in one month in Nenagh, only 12 involved a general anaesthetic.  It is clear there is a need for us to change the way we think about these issues.  This debate presents an opportunity for a bipartisan approach to these issues to ensure we have better patient safety and better outcomes for patients.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1094	During my political career I always have been committed to addressing the many and varied problems at Nenagh General Hospital.  With others, I have battled long and hard to preserve and protect it over the years.  My only motivation and objective was to ensure the provision of the best possible health service for the people of north Tipperary.  Health care must be outside politics.  It should not be used solely to win votes and enhance reputations.  For as long as I can remember, Nenagh General Hospital has struggled to survive.Health care is an emotive issue and affects people in a deeply personal way.  Personal health and well-being is the key priority.  What we need is a quality of care that is community focused, addresses the needs of everyone equally and locates the most intensive services in locations where they will be most valuable and widely available.We have confronted many challenges facing Nenagh General Hospital over the years arising from policy decisions initiated by different Governments under former Ministers for Health such as Barry Desmond, Deputy Hanlon and Deputy Noonan.  Nenagh General Hospital has again reached a critical juncture.  The decisions we take now will determine whether it has a future.As a politician, I feel obliged to listen and take notice of the professional medical advice on the structures and procedures that are considered to give the best possible patient care.  I have consulted widely with all the important stakeholders.  I believe that consultation with senior and experienced medical professionals is the correct way to make informed judgments.  The surgeons in the front line, including the head of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,  Professor Frank Keane, support the reform of surgical facilities in the mid-west.  Senior accident and emergency consultants, such as Cathal O'Donnell and Paul Burke currently working at the coalface in the mid-west, say that the current system operating in small hospitals is costing lives.  How can any politician ignore those statements?Listening to the one-sided debate about Nenagh General Hospital, it would be easy to get the impression that everything is perfect at present.  Let me put on record that Nenagh General Hospital in its current configuration has significant problems.  Its surgical unit is inadequate for major elective surgery, as it does not have the adequate recovery rooms, intensive care unit and anaesthetic systems required by modern-day medical practice.The Health Information Quality Authority was established in response to malpractice and systems failure in other hospitals that had disastrous consequences for unsuspecting patients.  This same quality authority conducted a hospital-wide audit of Nenagh General Hospital in 2007.  The quality authority put Nenagh's management on notice that patient safety and infection prevention standards were not up to an acceptable level within the sterile services structure of the hospital.  The sterile services are located within the operating theatre.  These operating theatres are in place since 1954.  They are outdated as well as structurally and clinically redundant.  If they are not demolished and replaced, we will face an order for closure of the current surgical theatres.Also in 2007, it was recognised at clinical level that Nenagh General Hospital did not have the range or diversity of clinical skills to cope effectively with or manage major trauma.  In reaction to this reality a trauma bypass protocol was put in place at the beginning of 2008.  Nenagh General Hospital is now bypassed in the case of events such as major car crashes because it is deemed the existing surgical and back-up facilities cannot cope.  Under this protocol the paramedics at the scene of an accident or emergency situation were given the discretion to determine the extent of injuries or condition of the patient and make an instant decision as to which hospital would best meet the medical requirements of that patient.We hear much talk about the golden hour concept and in that context it also should be realised that under the present system between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. radiographers and laboratory technicians are not in the hospital and are only on call.  This means there is an inevitable delay of up to one hour when a critically ill patient arrives at the hospital.  At present one has to wait for the radiographer or the laboratory technician to be called and arrive at the hospital before an X-ray can be completed or a blood analysis conducted.In short, I am saying those leading the agitation for the existing system to be retained at Nenagh are misinformed, misguided and putting patient care in jeopardy and the future of the hospital at risk.  Retaining the status quo at Nenagh without capital investment will lead to stagnation, unsafe standards and ultimate closure.Nenagh General Hospital needs investment to survive.  Without a multimillion euro upgrade of outdated facilities, the hospital has no future in any capacity.  If we do not have capital investment, it will close.  As a way forward Nenagh hospital needs to assert itself to the extent of its ability as a centre of excellence in its own right.  To this end, it needs a cash injection of millions.  When I committed to the support of this Government, I placed priority on the provision of funds for capital projects at Nenagh General Hospital.  I sought and received verbal and written commitments from then Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, later endorsed by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  These included the provision of two new surgical theatres, a new endoscopy unit and diagnostic centre, together with ancillary facilities and accommodation.Since the publication of the Teamwork report I have had extensive discussions with the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I advised her that the reform suggested to improve the delivery of health services to the people of north Tipperary must be predicated on fully operational and functioning alternative structures being in place.  It became apparent during those discussions that there was in existence three separate development plans for Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh.  I was understandably concerned that Limerick Regional Hospital's proposed development would be funded, progressed and completed.  We could then have a nightmare scenario for north Tipperary whereby the HSE might say that Limerick had the capacity to meet all needs, Nenagh was surplus to requirements and a doomsday decision would be made not to proceed with investment in Nenagh.To avoid that possibility I secured from the Minister a commitment to commission one overall integrated plan for the mid-west.  The Minister gave me a further guarantee that the development of Limerick and Nenagh would take place in conjunction with each other.  She also gave a commitment that the capital projects for Nenagh, included in my agreement with the Taoiseach, would be delivered.  These multimillion projects such as the new surgical theatres, the endoscopy and diagnostic units will be included for funding under the multiannual capital programme of the Department of Health and Children to be announced in the coming weeks.The Minister has undertaken to ensure the existing CAT scanner at Nenagh General Hospital will be fully commissioned and staffed.  She has committed to a significant enhancement of the ambulance service in the mid-west through an increased out-of-hours ambulance cover.  She fully appreciates the crucial role of advanced paramedics in the new structures and has committed to the provision of an adequate number to cover north Tipperary.  Day surgery and diagnostic facilities are to be extensively developed and easily accessible.The Minister has also committed to appoint eight additional hospital consultants to enable the delivery of these new services and specialties in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals.  She has made a commitment to me that primary care teams will also play a major part in the proposed reform of health services in north Tipperary.  Currently, two teams are successfully up and running in Roscrea, Borrisokane and Cloughjordan.  In Thurles, the development of two primary care teams is well under way.  The process will be expedited to provide care teams in Templemore, Nenagh, Ballina and Newport.  These are critical to ensure the success of any local health reform and will ensure the people of north Tipperary are treated effectively in their own localities.A new medical assessment unit will be provided at Nenagh General Hospital.  This will be accessible by a GP referral system.  What this means in effect is that most of the patients currently treated at Nenagh will continue to be treated there.  There will be no reduction in the services provided to the public of north Tipperary requiring medical care.  The staff at Nenagh General Hospital are professional, dedicated, caring and committed.  I have been assured that under the new proposed reconfiguration all permanent nursing, attendant, porter, cleaning, catering and clerical officer staff will retain their jobs.The Teamwork report set out to put in place upgraded services to improve patient care and to treat the patient in the most appropriate setting based on the recommendations of medical staff, that is, doctors, nurses, consultants and general practitioners.  I am of the firm belief that if the components of this report are not implemented in their totality, there is no future for Nenagh General Hospital and it will be allowed to whittle away and die.  The people of north Tipperary know the extent of my commitment to them and to what is in their best interests.  In that respect, this is the correct decision to best serve the interests of the people of my community.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1095	I wish to share time with Deputies Joe Carey, Pat Breen and Tom Hayes, if that is in order.At the outset, I acknowledge the role played by the staff, medical and otherwise, of Nenagh General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  I acknowledge also the emergency services who provide such a fantastic service, in difficult situations, to the people of north Tipperary.Deputy Lowry provided a list of what we all want in north Tipperary.  I share those wishes, going as far back as my time on the health board when a development plan was put forward by the eminent consultant, Mr. Paul Burke, who has been much mentioned in the House.  That plan saw a role for the four hospitals in the mid-west in providing a complete service for the entire region.  Specific specialised services with a dedicated consultant-led team were to be provided in each hospital in the region.For Nenagh General Hospital, those would have been neurology, vascular surgery, ENT and cardiovascular surgery.  That was to be welcomed.  In the development plan drawn up by the health board, of which I was a member, Nenagh General Hospital was put forward also for upgrading of theatres and an endoscopy suite, all the items that Deputy Lowry now promises.  That was at the beginning of the Celtic tiger era when Deputy Mary Harney became Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Lowry did not support the Government and Fianna Fáil promised the sun, moon and stars to the people of north Tipperary.  Did that party deliver in times of plenty? I put that question to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Máire Hoctor, whom I welcome to the House tonight.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1096	Yes, it did.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1097	I am glad she is not at a Labour Party rally tonight.  Did the party deliver?  It did not.  What confidence and trust can the people of north Tipperary now have in Fianna Fáil's ability to deliver, aided and abetted by Deputy Lowry?  I say they can have none and I offer an example, although Deputy Lowry has left the House.  This time last year, capital funding was planned to provide for a 20-bed stay unit in Borrisokane.  Such step-down facilities to get people out of hospital are so important, as we are told in the Teamwork report.  On 31 December, this plan was withdrawn in another example of reneging.Can we be assured of the funding?  The word is that it will be announced presently, as part of a deal by Deputy Lowry, just as the unit for Borrisokane was.  We are to believe it will be announced, for sure, and that there will be great drama over it, but will the plan ever go ahead?  How long must we wait before it is withdrawn as in the case of Borrisokane?That is the problem with this report.  Deputy Lowry mentioned different consultants and the advice they have given.  I, too, have listened to consultants.  I have spoken to Mr. Paul Burke and have met him.  He said he was quite happy because 80% of the people in the mid-west region were within 35 minutes of Limerick.  The 20% who come from north Tipperary and from County Clare did not matter to him.  They may live more than 50 miles away and be well over an hour away from Limerick Regional Hospital.  Before this year is out, they will matter to Mr. Paul Burke, the HSE and the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor.  I know she is concerned about the people but these issues must be addressed and that is not happening.We have heard about the ambulance service.  Deputy Lowry will speak of another deal and say he secured an ambulance base for Thurles.  The ambulance personnel there are working in deplorable conditions.  What happened to that promise?  Why is that not being delivered?  The same applies to an ambulance base in Nenagh which was not delivered in times of plenty.  The Minister of State has told the House that all will now be implemented at a time when the Government is on its knees, having broken the country and with not a penny left in the banks.  Who is codding whom?  One can cod some of the people some of the time, but one cannot cod all the people all the time.I know Mr. Burke well, but I wish to deal with some of the issues.  If Deputy Lowry gets his way, we will have a day care centre in Nenagh.  That is fine, but we will not have a hospital because there will be no surgery in that hospital.  Is it not ironic that the Teamwork report states clearly that acute services will be transferred from Nenagh General Hospital to St. John's Hospital in Limerick?  Deputy Cregan said no parochial element or politics were involved.  We heard it from the Minister of State, Deputy Power.  What kind of politics is that?  It is not considered good enough to operate on people from north Tipperary in Nenagh General Hospital.  Instead they are to be moved to St. John's.  The Deputy called out the figures which are less than those in Nenagh.  Where is the critical mass we are told is so essential for safety?  Of course it is a political matter.The people of north Tipperary deserve better and the Minister of State knows that.  We have our hospital that has served us well, and other generations too, throughout the years.  I listened to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, last night.  She spoke with passion and I admire her for that.  She talked about delivering quality medical care, and we all want that.  I share that wish with the Minister, but the difference lies in how and where it is provided.  We want quality care as it was, and is, provided at present in Nenagh.  We want that care to be continued there.  What we have we will hold.  The premier people of the premier county will rise up and speak and the Minister of State will know this well before the matter is out.  She knows the anger that is palpable among the people of north Tipperary about the way they are being treated.I recently had experience of Nenagh General Hospital.  Late on a Saturday night I was brought into the accident and emergency department there.  I could not have been treated better.  I was stabilised, comforted and diagnosed, and was sent to Limerick Regional Hospital the following Sunday evening for an operation on Monday morning.  I will say two things about that.  First, when I got to Limerick on the Sunday night I had to go through the accident and emergency department for an X-ray.  By God, I was horrified.  It was worse than a Beirut battlefield, with the bodies strewn on the corridor.  The trolleys were all used up as were the beds and the chairs.  Everything was thrown about everywhere.  When I met the professional who was to treat me she told me that, as a public representative, I must take action and do something about the situation.  She said that staff could not stand the pressure, which she described as unreal.  She had 83 patients to attend to after treating me.The second reason I mention my experience is because in Nenagh we got such wonderful service.  Last night, I listened to the Minister, Deputy Harney.  She implied criticism of the four emergency consultants who lead a wonderful emergency department in Nenagh and questioned their professionalism and abilities.  When this service was put into Nenagh as a cutback, the same Minister and the same Fianna Fáil Party told us it was the answer to all our needs and our medical requirements in north Tipperary.  It is quite a turnabout to hear the Minister imply criticism of professionals, as if they were not doing their job correctly.  It is amazing.The problem here is trust in the Minister and in Fianna Fáil who are hiding behind the HSE concerning the delivery of their promises.  A man said recently at a public meeting that if he were fed on Fianna Fáil promises, he would weigh 50 stone.  I am fairly overweight but I would surely weigh 50 stone if I were fed on the promises that have been reneged upon by Fianna Fáil.  The people cannot trust, and that is the problem with the proposal in front of us.  It puts the cart before the horse, closing down the services that are there and have served the community well without putting in place what was promised, and which is unlikely ever to be in place.  The only way these promises will ever be put in place will be when Deputy Reilly moves over to the other side of the House.  Fine Gael will deliver as it has done in the past.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1098	It is time for the Government to end the hypocrisy regarding the future of the 24-hour accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital. I support my party's spokesperson on health, Deputy James Reilly, and the position he has taken on this matter.  I commend him for bringing this motion before the House.The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated in this House last night that the reason County Clare people are worried about what will happen when services are removed from Ennis General Hospital is because politicians are telling them that patients will die.  That was an outrageous statement for a Minister to make.  If the Minister had bothered to come down to meet with the people of County Clare, she would know they are worried about their health and the health of their children.  They are also worried about the promises they got from Government politicians in election after election.  Government politicians stood on the steps of the O'Connell monument in the square of Ennis promising that Ennis General Hospital was safe, but as soon as the election was over, the promises went out the window.When former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern breezed into County Clare in 2006 he pledged his support for the hospital to a local journalist.  He said:The hospital is safe.  People should be supporting this Government which is investing in this hospital instead of chasing rabbits and hares around Clare.He even proclaimed that this commitment was written in stone when he said, "I have given this commitment in writing and people should stop beating the drum."  The former Taoiseach has plenty of time now for chasing rabbits and hares.  I was elected by the people of County Clare and I will never stop beating the drum for them.  Sadly, the people of County Clare will pay a high price for the reckless abandonment of pre-election promises by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.The under-investment in Ennis General Hospital by the Minister's Government over the past ten years is testament to this Government's lack of political will and ability to speak up for the people of County Clare.  The management and staff at the Hospital have been starved of resources for years and every request for funding from the Government and the HSE has been met with resistance.  In October 2004 this lack of resources prompted the consultants working in Ennis General Hospital to comment in an open letter:Consultants working within the mid-west region noticed a marked superiority in the resources available to patients presenting to Limerick Regional Hospital compared to Ennis General Hospital.  This inequality of access to health care is wrong.Last night here the Minister said the HIQA report will be published shortly.  I hope it will have some comforting news for the Moriarty and Kelly families.  They deserve this after their tragic losses.  Lessons must be learned, but I hope the Minister will not use this report as a means of closing services at Ennis General Hospital, or even closing the hospital.I will give an example of something that happened this week in south-east Clare, in Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's constituency.  The HSE confirmed that the health centre which was built in Westbury in south-east Clare at a cost of €500,000 will not open due to a shortage of funding.  Yet the Teamwork report requires €380 million.  This plan to remove services from the hospital from 1 April must be an April Fools' Day joke.  As a Councillor I served the people in west Clare, and the area is long and far from Limerick Regional Hospital.  I welcome the members of Ennis General Hospital who are here to listen to this debate.  The Ennis General Hospital development committee recently tested the "golden hour".  It took one hour and 43 minutes to get from Kilbaha in west Clare to Limerick Regional Hospital.  Some time ago a constituent of mine from west Clare told me it probably would be easier to phone the undertaker if we are to depend on this level of service.In the absence of 24-hour accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital the ambulance service is expected to deliver mobile emergency care throughout the county.  How is it expected to deliver this with the service already operating on a shoe string?  On several occasions I have pointed out to the Minister, Deputy Moloney, the over-reliance on on-call services, private ambulances being called in from time to time and the lack of 24-7 cover in Scarrif ambulance station.  The Minister has not invested one cent in upgrading the ambulance services.  He says he will provide six extra advanced paramedics to cover County Clare.  That is totally inadequate.  It will not work with shift work and sickness.This Government has lost touch with the people.  Last night a patient was left on a trolley at Ennis General Hospital overnight because Limerick was not able to accept more patients.  What will happen after 1 April?  Where will the patients go?  I urge the Minister to get real.  This plan cannot work because the resources are not there.  I appeal to the Minister to abandon it.  It is time for the Government politicians to end the double-speak on Ennis General Hospital.  Last night here my colleague, Deputy Dooley said, "It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that these changes are made without delay."  He went on to say, "If the changes are to be successful, they should be supported by investment."  Where is the investment?  No wonder the people of Clare are confused and worried about what they hear.There are very few of our colleagues over there tonight, but I invite them to come over here and stand with us in favour of the motion at the end of the night.  I ask them to join us, to take one small step across the floor.  If they do that it will be a giant step to secure the services at Ennis General Hospital.  I invite them to join the people of Clare and Tipperary, and in the words of the great Munster anthem, "stand up and fight."  They must fight for what is right, for what is in the best interests of the people of Clare and Tipperary, and support this motion.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1099	Tonight we are at a crossroads.  The signposts are clear.  One path leads us to the continuation of 24-hour accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital together with the upgrade of that hospital.  The other path leads us to the dismantling of County Clare's accident and emergency services and their replacement with an eight-to-eight nurse-led minor injuries clinic, relying on two paramedics in one car to cover the whole of County Clare and protect the 110,000 people who live there.Last night I listened to the Minister, Deputy Harney, saying this issue should be removed from politics and be above politics.  This is a political decision.  We are public representatives, elected by the people to articulate their views and represent them to the best of our ability.  I make no apology for that.  Since the year 2000, successive Ministers for Health and Children have made political commitments to the people of Clare.  These political promises have been made by Deputies Martin, Cowen, Bertie Ahern and every Fianna Fáil Deputy in County Clare.  Fianna Fáil political figures from the very top gave commitments that 24-hour accident and emergency services would remain at Ennis General Hospital and that the hospital will receive a €39 million upgrade.  This is a political decision.The Teamwork report does not move Loop Head any closer to Limerick Regional Hospital.  It is still 74 miles.  The Teamwork report ignores the "golden hour" principle.  This is the standard international maximum time limit to treat anyone who has suffered a stroke, a heart attack or who has had an accident.  Some 44,000 Clare people will be left outside the golden hour cover if the Minister's plans go ahead.  There are alternative models of providing accident and emergency care to dispersed populations, such as that delivered in the highlands and islands of Scotland.  The British NHS was moving to centralise services in Scotland but their Minister for Health recognised that it would not work because it was not safe or right to ask people to travel extreme distances.  That Minister had the courage to ignore and reject a centralisation policy and adopted a more appropriate model.  The same model operates in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England and closer to home at Downpatrick Hospital.The shared factor in each of these examples is that since the year 2003, the NHS has been legally required to consult with patients and the public when any change in health care is proposed.  The Minister and the HSE have done their best to conceal the HSE report from the people.  GPs in County Clare and Nenagh were not consulted.  Nurses were not consulted; nor were the people of County Clare.  It is obvious the Minister is determined to provide accident and emergency services on the cheap while dressing them up as a standard of international excellence.  This is being done with no consultation and little regard for the people on the ground who so desperately need, want and deserve speedy access to an accident and emergency unit.Leaving aside the issue of the golden hour, nobody is convinced that any of these improvements can be delivered in Limerick Regional Hospital in such a short space of time.  For example, six years ago the Hanly report promised a dramatic improvement in ambulance services, but nothing has happened.  In fact, the service has disimproved.  We have less capacity now than we did six years ago because an ambulance can carry only one person, and extra ambulances have not been provided.  The HSE has failed to address this issue, and it continues to ignore the ambulance crew based in Ennis, who have campaigned for a year to be provided with a simple washing facility.  They must clean the ambulances with a bucket and mop, using a tap in the public car park, with people walking in and out through it.  The HSE has done nothing about this.  How are we expected to believe the Minister will improve ambulance services?  The Minister's plans are simply unrealistic.  Will the 135 beds promised for Limerick Regional Hospital appear from the sky on 1 April?  Will the five additional accident and emergency consultants required wander in off the streets and arrive in a new accident and emergency theatre?Behind all these reports and planned cuts are real people with real lives and real stories to tell.  About a year and a half ago, a good friend of mine — a young man from Ruan — was involved in a farm accident on the outskirts of Ennis, in a place called Larchill. When agitating slurry, he came in contact with the gas and inhaled it.  He collapsed, but fortunately there was a man there to raise the alarm.  He called the ambulance service and the young man was admitted to Ennis General Hospital.  People in the area found out about this accident, concern was expressed, and a mass was held in Ruan.  All the people of the area came, and I was there myself.  We all prayed for that young fellow.  Because of the intervention at Ennis General Hospital, that young man has made a full recovery.  He is 100% better.  If he had to travel to Limerick by ambulance, that man would be brain-damaged today.  That is the real benefit of having an accident and emergency unit in one's locality.  It saves lives and improves recovery.  With that vital intervention, the young man was saved.I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, if she would ask any of her constituents to travel from Dublin to Roscrea for accident and emergency services.  That sounds ridiculous, but it is the same distance as that from Loop Head to Limerick Regional Hospital.  In recent weeks, sick people have been lying on trolleys for three days in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Surgery has been cancelled as there have been insufficient beds.  I ask the Minister not to make the same mistake in the mid-west.  I demand the best hospital service for the people of County Clare.  That will not be delivered by closing an accident and emergency unit or by transforming Ennis General Hospital into a glorified nursing home.  Tonight I appeal to all Members of the House, of every political persuasion, to join in supporting this Fine Gael motion to preserve the vital 24-hour accident and emergency services in Ennis hospital and support its redevelopment.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1100	What is at issue tonight affects not only the people of Nenagh and Ennis but all people living in rural Ireland, no matter from what part of the country they come.  In recent years we have been obsessed with the notion that making things bigger automatically means better services.  I will draw a comparison which might sound funny.  Those of us from rural constituencies will remember the amalgamation of creameries many years ago, and how this was to change the face of rural Ireland.  We now see the difficulties the dairy industry is in.  In my own constituency of south Tipperary, Mullinahone Co-op, a small unit that was left there on its own, is now probably more efficient than any other unit.  I am making that comparison because we are obsessed, in every facet of life, with making things bigger and amalgamating them.South Tipperary has suffered one of the most divisive events to occur in the health system, the amalgamation of services at Cashel and Clonmel.  The debate went on for about 40 years and divided the people and the towns.  Ten years ago the two hospitals were amalgamated and the surgical hospital was taken to Clonmel.  A great plan was put in place.  Now, ten years on, it is proposed to move some of the services to Waterford, including the maternity service.  Last Monday the Oireachtas Members for south Tipperary were briefed and told the Teamwork report would be shortly moving south.  What is happening in the mid-west region will happen to us.  There will be more amalgamations in Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford and south Tipperary.  The people of north Tipperary and Clare are right to stand up and fight every inch of the way.  This amalgamation will not bring more efficiencies to the health service.  That is our experience.  I ask every public representative on all sides of the House to consider what has happened in south Tipperary.  It could have been a good experience but, alas, I do not believe it was.  People in Cashel are waiting for services, while some have been put in place.  The staff contact me on a regular basis about all the things that have not yet been provided.  There is a fear in north Tipperary and Clare that the improvements that have been promised will not occur.  There is no confidence that these changes will bring about an improved service.  That is what is wrong.  To say people will get better services looks good on paper and sounds better.  However, the reality is that services have not improved over the years.  When we had small hospitals in every town around the country there were better services, and people supported that.  That is why I say the Teamwork reports, when their recommendations are put in place, do not necessarily result in a better service.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1101	Last night and this evening we have heard a range of views about the planned changes in the organisation of hospital services in the mid-west.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, noted that the issues being discussed and the reasons advanced for maintaining the status quo have changed little over a period of 30 to 40 years.  However, there has been a shift in the nature of the debate.  We are all now familiar with the expert advice that, where the delivery of complex care is concerned, better outcomes for patients are achieved if this takes place where the necessary staff and equipment is to hand and sufficient volumes of activity take place.  Despite what others may suggest, the available evidence also emphasises the need to provide timely emergency care to patients in an appropriate setting and that this leads to lower rates of death, fewer complications and longer life.  Therefore, while we may still differ on matters of detail or on how change is to be brought about, I believe that among health professionals and the general population there is recognition that change is necessary and that it will ensure higher quality and more sustainable services for the future.  Both the Government and the HSE are committed to a process of change which is incremental, with appropriate consultation and discussion with those affected.  The HSE, with Mr. Paul Burke as clinical lead, is working with stakeholders to develop, explain and give effect to the reorganisation plans.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1103	It is very important that we explain clearly to the population of the mid-west what the changes will involve and the reasons for them.  However, it is equally important that they are not misled as to their nature and purpose.  It is sometimes alleged that the Government and the HSE want to "downgrade" smaller hospitals in order to save money.  This is not so.  It is in nobody's interest, least of all that of the people living in the mid-west and north Tipperary, that anybody should seek to perpetuate a configuration of acute hospital services which is not sustainable and which will not deliver the best health outcomes for patients.I am a native of Nenagh; I was born in Nenagh hospital.  I will not stand in defiance of professional opinion and the evidence-based policy to achieve greater patient safety.  The nature of health service delivery is changing and the direction of future development is towards an increased proportion of diagnosis and treatment taking place on a day or outpatient basis.  This is much more convenient for patients and their families as well as much more cost effective.  Each of the acute hospitals in the region will continue to have a very significant role as parts of an integrated regional service.This cannot be implemented without significant investment in Nenagh, Ennis and Limerick hospitals.  This Government and Fianna Fáil-led Governments through the years have a history of investment in Nenagh hospital, from coronary care to the extension and to the expanded X-ray and accident and emergency unit.

At present, approximately 700 patients per year from Nenagh and 1,000 from Ennis are referred to Limerick for CT scans.  Under the new arrangement, this service will be provided in the local hospitals, which will be more convenient for patients and the general practitioners, who will have direct access to CT referrals.

This service will also come within the scope of a regional structure and arrangements will be in place to facilitate the seamless transfer of patients between the local and regional hospital.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	That is not happening.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1111	It will mean that patients will be able to quickly access specialist care.  These arrangements will be kept under ongoing review to ensure that they are working as intended and that patients are enabled to access the care they need as quickly as possible.The shortcomings of the existing accident and emergency arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh and the small patient numbers involved have been set out.  The restructuring of services will therefore involve full accident and emergency care being provided from the Regional Hospital, Limerick, supported by Ennis and Nenagh which will have medically supervised local emergency centres for non-major emergencies, minor injuries and self-referred medical problems.  These will be open for approximately 12 hours per day and will operate under agreed governance structures and protocols.  Governance structures are not in place at present in Nenagh and Ennis with regard to the accident and emergency physicians.  They are doing a very good job but governance is not in place and that is not sustainable for the future in the interests of patient safety.I appreciate that people are concerned about services for those who fall seriously ill or are involved in an accident in areas further away from the regional centre in Limerick.  The key to quality emergency and trauma management is pre-hospital care that enables life-saving treatment to be provided quickly to patients.  Stabilisation can be carried out by advanced paramedics who travel quickly to the patient.  Six of these staff, with specially equipped emergency response cars, are being deployed in north Tipperary and six in County Clare in the coming months.

That is already happening.There is no recognition from the Opposition of the investment in the new fleet of ambulances which has taken place in the last three years in the mid-west.  There has been serious investment in the ambulance fleet.

The additional resources which undoubtedly will be needed in the reconfiguration of the hospitals in question will also be needed to support the general practitioners in their work.  I will support them in that regard and, indeed, in any other way possible.

Team work implies that everybody works together; it involves people working to a particular and agreed objective.  Most of all, it involves consent, effort and everybody rowing in the same direction, like a rowing boat team in a race, towards the target of better health for everybody.  I can offer to the people of the mid-west my experience of the so-called Teamwork report for the north east.  The lessons that have been learned there have obviously not been taken on board by the Government.There is no team work.  It is health administration by diktat by people who are not nameless but who are certainly not publicly accountable.  There is no transparency about their actions and no knowledge about what is happening.  They decide and dictate.  There is total chaos in the north east.  The so-called team work principle of people working together does not apply there.  The Minister for Health and Children, her Department and the HSE have refused to insist on the basic tenet of team work, a principle the Minister enunciated, that no service will be closed down until a better one is in place for the people.It is quite reasonable and clear that if one has a serious illness that requires specialist knowledge and technology to treat it, one will travel to the ends of the earth to get it.  In the north east the smaller hospitals are being closed down, with the services being put into two hospitals, one in Drogheda and one in Cavan.  Every day this week in Drogheda there was an average of 20 patients on trolleys.  People spend their nights not in hospital beds or rooms but in offices.  It is an appalling situation in which people are treated very badly.  This is happening while there are vacant beds in other hospitals which could accommodate those patients.  They are not being sent there because the HSE Teamwork plan is to close them down.  However, it is not putting the replacement services in place.All the general practitioners, nurses and medical staff in the region have said that the transformation team is not working.  I understand four directors appointed by the HSE to assist the Teamwork approach have resigned because they could not fulfil their obligations and provide the services that are so badly needed.  Clearly, that is also happening in Clare and north Tipperary.  The pressure will be put on Limerick Regional Hospital and it will be unable to cope.The bottom line is that the Teamwork report is all about stress.  It is about doctors complaining.  A total of 41 general practitioners in Cavan and Monaghan have written recently to the Minister, Deputy Harney, about this issue.  They clearly state that it cannot and will not work under the current arrangements because the Minister is failing to put in place a better, more effective and efficient service to deliver services to patients in the region.  The two major hospitals are overcrowded, which is a cause for concern.  There is concern about the number of anaesthetists on duty.  There have been very serious errors in areas like radiology where people have died as a result of misdiagnosis, and the Minister does not want that to happen in Nenagh, Clare or Limerick.The key is for the Minister to get her act together.  If she is proceeding with a Teamwork report, it should only happen when there is team work, when everybody is on board — the nurses, the doctors, the consultants.  The problem is that the Minister is working in the dark, is operating by diktat and working in a way in which the consultants are not involved.  As a result, there is fiasco and chaos reigning in the hospitals in the north east because of Teamwork.Our colleagues from the mid-west are clear about their concerns today.  It will not get better.  It will get worse because the Minister is not providing the investment before she moves the people to the hospitals.  Is it any wonder they would be up in arms, worried and concerned?If the Government wants to be successful, a good Minister for Health and Children will ensure that everybody buys into the process.  In that regard a step by step process is better for everybody.  One cannot close down services until new services are in place.I would warn the HSE in the mid-west to look and examine what is happening in the north east, and to fully examine and understand the situation there.  If the HSE would have sight of the letters of which the Minister has sight from all of the consultants, the general practitioners, the specialists in the region and the ordinary people, it would understand what a mess the Minister is making of the health service and how upset and how disadvantaged the people in mid-Munster or Clare, in north Tipperary and in Limerick will be as a result of the Minister's appalling and shameful operation of the HSE.  A better name for it probably might be the "Hide-and-Seek Executive", especially when one considers the cases where one cannot make contact with the relevant officials.  It is the health secrets executive.  The Minister cannot get at the truth, cannot get accountability and transparency, and cannot get at the facts.  She can never influence those decisions.  That is why the Minister has all those people up in arms with her.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1121	I wish to join with Deputy Reilly and my Fine Gael colleagues this evening in expressing my deep concern about the proposed rationalisation of hospital services in the mid-west.The HSE commissioned Horwarth Consulting Ireland and Teamwork Management Services to report on acute hospital services in the mid-west and the report was made publicly available in January of this year.  While none of us can argue against best international practice that aims to maximise best clinical outcomes and improve patient safety as outlined in the report, we can argue about the way the Minister and the HSE plan to implement these changes and the potential negative impact they will have on patient care.As the Minister, Deputy Harney, will be aware, the report clearly identifies a number of preconditions that must be met if the new plan for hospital services in the mid-west is to succeed.  These preconditions include significant increases in medical manpower, further development of pre-hospital and primary care services as set out in the Primary Care Strategy 2001 and the development of critical infrastructure requirements including regional centres of excellence in Limerick city.The purpose of this Private Members' motion is not to oppose reforms that are in the best interests of patients' safety.  Its purpose is to remind the Minister of the precondition that must be met before critical hospital services are withdrawn as outlined in her report, and to remind the Minister of the over-riding principle, contained in the report, which states that no acute services will be withdrawn from the current general hospitals until the regional centre of excellence is resourced and ready to deliver that service with reference to international quality standards.  Despite this clear recommendation, it seems that the Minister and the HSE plan to set ahead with the withdrawal of the accident and emergency services even though the essential upgrade of facilities in Limerick has not taken place, as well as ambulance, general practitioner and primary care provision.We are extremely concerned about the provision of ambulance facilities from the Kilmallock area for which we have been pressing for a number of years.  Currently there are three hard-working accident and emergency consultants spread across four accident and emergency services in the mid-west.  This is contrary to the patient safety best international practice and is unsustainable in the long term.  The report commissioned by the HSE strongly recommends that it take prompt action to reduce the current levels of clinical risk and improve patient safety.

I am proud that my family have been part of this.  My sister Mary has been with the Mid-Western Regional Hospital for almost 40 years, my wife Goretti for 30 years.I wish to pay a special tribute to the staff of St. John's Hospital for their caring for Goretti during her time there in recent years.  Likewise I pay tribute to those in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital for their kindness to her.  My family, Tom, Maria, Maeve, Danny and I, especially wish to thank Dr. Liam Casserly and the staff for their efforts to save her life on the 25 and 26 January last, and thank them for her peaceful departure on the 27th.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	I thank all my colleagues who have taken part in this debate from all sides of the House.The motion is clear in its intent.  It does not seek to block progress.  It seeks to ensure that all necessary arrangements are put in place, as recommended by the HSE's own Teamwork Management Services report, before any decision is made on the downgrading of the accident and emergency departments at hospitals at Nenagh or Ennis.  It further calls for the immediate provision upgrades at both hospitals.  The report specifically refers to 135 additional new acute inpatient beds, but the Minister last night told us because we are not moving services from Macroom or the services from the maternity hospitals that this will not be necessary.This is the Minister being selective in her use of quotations.  I first refer to the selective quote she takes from the Royal College of Surgeons, whose president favours this plan but who states clearly that it will be dangerous if they are put into overloaded accident and emergency departments.  In other words, they do not want it implemented piecemeal fashion, and that is what is happening here.I have a copy of the Teamwork Management Services report before me and I will quote from selected sections.  It states:However, consideration must be given to the economies of scale in developing the existing site to provide a modern, ‘fit for purpose' facility, or whether a new purpose-built regional ‘centre of excellence' should be developed.  The list of reconfiguration/refurbishment . . . is substantial and includes:New obstetrics, midwifery and neonatal unit;New elective orthopaedics unit;New or refurbished A&E;New or refurbished critical care unit [the high dependency unit];Complete ward refurbishment to infection control standards; and [not instead of]New additional in-patient beds, totalling 135.It will be seen from this that the 135 beds are in addition to obstetrics and orthopaedics, therefore, the Minister is disingenuous in what she stated last night.While on the subject of maternity and this report, I refer to page 22 of the report where it states:However, there are well recognised residual risks to mothers as the hospital [St. Munchin's] is not co-located with adult critical care support services.  Furthermore, there is no on-site paediatric cover for babies which poses further risks.  Plans are now agreed for a final move of the service to the Regional Hospital Dooradoyle.However, the Minister told us last night that those plans will not be implemented.Moving to page 36 of the report, the last paragraph states:In the meantime [this is critical] until implementation of the new service configuration is completed, put in place transitional support arrangements, in the form of additional temporary medical staffing for Ennis and Nenagh in particular to improve the quality of current services.Finally, lest there be any doubt about what this report contains, in heightened blue it states:The over-riding principle is that no acute services will be withdrawn from the current general hospitals until the regional ‘centre of excellence' is resourced and ready to deliver that service with reference to international quality standards.I am afraid the Minister, yet again, — as is her wont so often to selectively quote from various documents, reframe the truth and present it as something entirely different — has failed.  These are additional beds and they need to be put in place.The report further recommends an increase in the number of ambulances, which the Minister has not been able to guarantee.  In fact, on "Prime Time" last week, the cock crowed three times and still she could not give an undertaking that these ambulances would be in place, because there were industrial relations and human resources issues.  That is not good enough for the people of north Tipperary, I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and not good enough for the people of Clare, I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.The report demands that a high dependency unit, consisting of 40 beds, be built at Limerick Regional Hospital.  Planning permission is not even sought.  It calls for an upgrade of the accident and emergency unit at Limerick Regional Hospital, and that has not taken place.  It calls for additional accident and emergency consultant staff, to bring the number up from three to eight, yet not a single job has been advertised.  It will take from 12 to 18 months to fill those posts.  The general practitioners of the region are against it.  Each one of them met with Mr. Burke, and not one voted for it.  All voted against it because they had no confidence in it, as it is currently being implemented.The consultants, as referred to last night by the Minister, are becoming increasingly alarmed, particularly at the manner in which this is being implemented.  The core of the matter is that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse yet again.  The Government wants the people of north Tipperary and Ennis to forego their current service because it believes it is not safe, in favour of a nirvana which has not been put in place.  Time and again the Minister has people giving up their current service for a promise of something wonderful to come, and in the gap that ensues people die.The bottom line here is trust.  I said this before and I shall say it again.  The people do not trust this Minister, Fianna Fáil, the Government or the HSE to deliver the promises they make.  They said there would not be cutbacks and there were.  They said they would not hurt patients and they did.  This Government promised it would vaccinate our children against cancer, and three months later turned its back on this.  In finishing, I ask the Minister to do the right thing.

I believe a death notice for South Tipperary General Hospital has appeared in the form of an information document dated 29 January 2009 on the modernisation of acute services for the hospital group south-east.  A short few years ago, St Joseph's County Medical and Maternity Hospital, Clonmel was renamed South Tipperary General Hospital at great expense and inconvenience to take account of the amalgamation with Our Lady's County Surgical Hospital, Cashel.South Tipperary General Hospital under the new guise of modernisation of acute services will lose its identity and become part of a recognised, or possibly unrecognised, group — it will become a statistic in the HSE plan.  Lest anyone forget or needs reminding, the HSE is about saving lives, not saving money.  The situation in regard to South Tipperary General Hospital and the proposed reconfiguration of hospital services within the south-east, and its impact, is a matter of grave concern to the constituents of Tipperary South and to myself.The implementation of the transformation programme as required by the national services plan will commence, we are told, in March 2009 with the development of a steering group for the modernisation of acute hospital services for the HSE group south-east.  The steering group will have a membership initially comprised of four clinical directors — one from each hospital — and a hospital manager.  The role of the steering group will be to supposedly agree and plan for a re-configuration model of acute hospital care for the hospital group south-east, make recommendations on service delivery issues and oversee the implementation of the modernisation programme.  A project manager will support the planning and implementation phases of the programme and the planning phase will be completed by September 2009.I am concerned that we have too many programme managers within the HSE and too few frontline staff.  Under the HSE plan for the modernisation of services, the so-called aims of discussion are as follows: understanding and clarification of challenges, as if we did not know already; having a shared understanding of the need for change; a shared understanding of what we must do and how we should go about it; and timelines — all fancy jargon adopted by the HSE.  However, what we have is no two-way dialogue, completely one-way traffic, a tunnel vision on behalf of the HSE and its management and no proper, meaningful consultations with the extremely hard-working and dedicated staff at Clonmel.As I said, the death notice for South Tipperary General Hospital has appeared in the form of this information document, dated 29 January 2009, with its fancy title concerning the modernisation of acute services for the hospital group.  I am totally opposed to these new plans to remove out-of-hours services or accident and emergency services after 7 p.m., as well as the removal of maternity services and all acute hospital services.  This would mean that never again would a child be born in Tipperary, which is unacceptable, particularly when we have a top quality maternity service with large numbers of deliveries each year.While I have no issue with centres of excellence, as with speakers on another debate today, I believe we must have centres of excellence in place before we attempt to remove services.  A radical change in the direction of health care policy is needed in the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive.  Democratic accountability must return to the Minister and services must return to our local hospitals.  There must be a health care system which truly places the patient first and which is capable of meeting the needs of our communities.  I remain committed to fight might and main to keep all services in South Tipperary General Hospital.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1128	I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising this important issue.  The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible, in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, such that people can have confidence in the care they receive and can expect the best possible outcomes.  Patient safety and quality must be prioritised and services organised and managed from that perspective.  In addition, services should be available, as far as possible, close to where people live.Currently, South Tipperary General Hospital provides acute services for a catchment population of some 135,000 people in South Tipperary and the bordering areas of North Tipperary and west County Waterford.  Since acute hospital services in South Tipperary were amalgamated in South Tipperary General Hospital in January 2007, following the transfer of accident and emergency, general surgery and oncology services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, service delivery arrangements have been much enhanced and have proved beneficial for both patients and health service staff in the area.We are all now familiar with the expert advice that, where the delivery of complex care is concerned, better outcomes for patients are achieved if this takes places where the necessary staff and equipment is all to hand and sufficient volumes of activity take place.  The available evidence also emphasises the need to provide timely emergency care to patients in an appropriate setting and that this leads to lower rates of death, fewer complications and longer life.It is important to appreciate that the nature of health service delivery is changing and that the direction of future development is towards an increased proportion of diagnosis and treatment taking place on a day or outpatient basis.  For example, much computerised tomography, CT, scanning and endoscopy work can be undertaken in local hospitals.  This is a good deal more convenient for patients and their families, as well as being much more cost-effective.The HSE's national service plan for 2009 contains a commitment to develop in the south east an overall framework for reconfiguration of all services in the hospital network.  The HSE is at present developing its plans to advance this work.  This task is at a relatively early stage.  The Government is committed to a process of change which is incremental, involving appropriate consultation and discussion with health professionals, service users and other interests.I assure Deputy Mattie McGrath and the House that any proposed changes emerging from the process in the south east will be the subject of consultation.  The HSE has already prepared the information document to which Deputy McGrath referred dealing with the modernisation of acute services in the region which will be a helpful input to the work ahead.Whatever configuration of services is ultimately decided upon, the Minister is confident that South Tipperary General Hospital and each of the other acute hospitals in the region will continue to play a valuable and significant role in the delivery of an integrated regional health service.  I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising this important issue.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1129	I wish to share time with Deputy Noel O'Flynn.  I welcome the opportunity to raise an issue of some practical significance to the country and the economy.  Ireland has a practical and developing relationship with Taiwan within the framework of its overall policy position on relations with countries in the region.  Many European countries have established a well-staffed representative office in Taiwan as a fundamental part of the policy to develop economic trade there, while also developing a relationship with China.  The staffing of these offices ranges from five people for Austria and Belgium, to 29 for Germany and as many as 53 for the United Kingdom and 55 for France.  In addition, the European Union has a large office in Taiwan with more than 50 staff.Ireland should upgrade the scale and scope of its presence in Taiwan as the foundation stone upon which better economic and social relations can be built.  Taiwan encourages freedom of movement internationally.  Based on the spirit of the 1944 Chicago convention on international civil aviation, Taiwan has granted visa exemption to 38 countries, including 24 of 27 EU member states.  Ireland is one of 27 European countries currently enjoying a 30-day visa-exempt entry arrangement into Taiwan, a privilege it has enjoyed since 2003.Visa exemption is a powerful means to enhance trade relations.  Total annual trade between Ireland and Taiwan stands at approximately €1 billion, of which almost €250 million is accounted for by Taiwan's imports from Ireland.  Taiwan is one of the world's most robust economies and is the world's sixteenth largest economy.  Its trade surplus is quite substantial and its foreign reserves are among the world's largest.  Ireland is not reaching its potential for trade with Taiwan.  In the current international economic climate and at a time when our economy is in decline and needs all the support and stimulus available, the impetus must surely be for Ireland to take the initiative and further develop trade links.Visa exemption is a powerful means by which to enhance the tourism trade.  Some 260,000 Taiwanese travel to Europe each year.  Surveys in Taiwan indicate this number would be considerably higher were it not for prohibitive visa regimes.  Following the introduction of a visa waiver scheme for Taiwan nationals visiting Japan in 2005, tourist numbers visiting Japan rose by 30%.  Taiwan people that travel overseas are generally quite wealthy and have proven to be valuable tourists who contribute strongly to the host country.  Visa-free entry to Ireland would attract an increasing number of Taiwan tourists visiting Europe and the UK.  If Ireland lifted its visa barrier and could attract a small percentage of visitors to Europe, it would be a substantial gain for the tourist industry in view of visitor purchasing power.Now is the time to take the initiative on the tourism front.  Following the UK announcement of a six-month visa-free entry system, Taiwanese interest in visiting the UK has soared.  Tour operators are now introducing a whole range of new travel packages.  This is a great potential source of new and immediate revenue.  A visa waiver to visit Ireland would certainly attract a proportion of Taiwanese visitors to the UK to also visit Ireland.In the area of education the difficulties for students attaining an entry visa imposes a particular handicap on any student considering visiting Ireland.  That the existing entry requirements into the UK are a good deal easier than attaining a visa to come to Ireland is evident from the fact that some 8,500 students from Taiwan travel to the UK every year, and make a contribution of more than £1 billion to the UK economy.  Increasing the international student market should be a key short-term objective for the educational sector.  Travelling Taiwanese students are well educated, highly motivated and adequately financed.  They should become a key market for our educational institutions.  However, we are a good deal behind our main competitors in this market, and with the introduction of a new six-month visa-free entry in the UK, Ireland is now in danger of being completely excluded from this market.  Time is of the essence in this issue.  We must avail of the window of opportunity and act now.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1130	The cold war is over between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, Taiwan.  The political question has been put aside, as President Ma stated during a visit by Deputies to Taiwan last August.  Taiwan is investing heavily in The People's Republic of China in such areas as tourism.  As Deputy Perry stated, we seem to be falling behind other EU countries.  Some €40 billion in goods and services is exported from the EU to Taiwan each year.  Germany is the largest exporter and we export €250 million.  As Deputy Perry indicated, we import €750 million which is an imbalance.It is time to organise an official trade mission to Taiwan.  I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness, to consider putting this proposal to the Government.  We should explain to the Chinese ambassador that we subscribe to the one China policy.  However, it should be possible to have Taiwan as one of our trading partners, as is the case in all other EU countries.  We should carry on more business in Taiwan.  We should beef up the number of staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs staff in Taiwan; at present, there is only one staff member in place.  I support the visa proposal.  Some nine students from Taiwan are studying in Ireland.  It is almost impossible to get a visa, but there are just less than 7,132 studying in England.  English is our second language.  Taiwanese people seek to come to Ireland, but we must make it easier to do so.  I welcome the move in the UK this week of providing a clear visa with no restrictions for people travelling to Taiwan for six months.All universities in the country are open for business.   I recently brought Representative Lee to University College Cork where the president of the college said that it was open for business and wanted the students because they are worth €35,000 each to this economy every year.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1131	In March 2007 the UK introduced a visa waiver test to assess the effectiveness of its visa regime.  Travel to the UK from every country outside of the EEA and Switzerland was measured against a range of criteria, including illegal immigration, crime and security concerns.  In July 2008 the results of this test were assessed and the UK then entered into a six month period of dialogue with the countries concerned to consider what steps might be taken to address the issues arising.Following the end of that period, the Home Office announced on Monday 9 February 2009 that the UK had decided to impose a visa requirement on nationals of Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland and Venezuela and had decided to lift the visa requirement for Taiwanese passport holders for short visits of less than six months.  This waiver is due to take effect from 3 March 2009.It is worth noting that the visa regime in the UK operates differently from the Irish regime in so far as all persons other than EU, EEA and Swiss nationals are required to obtain an entry visa or pre-entry clearance for stays in the UK for periods in excess of six months, regardless of the purpose of journey.  This will continue to be the case for Taiwan even after the visa waiver is introduced.  In contrast, the Irish system operates on the basis that, depending of his or her nationality, the visitor is either visa required or not, irrespective of the length of his or her stay or its purpose.The net result of the change in the UK is that students coming for university courses or other educational programmes lasting more than six months will continue to require visas but those coming for shorter periods will not.  Tourists and others coming on short visits will also be exempted.The existence of a visa requirement should not be a significant impediment to genuine visitors.  On the contrary its purpose is to separate the credible applications from the rest and the establishment of dedicated Irish visa offices in a number of countries has yielded significant benefits in this regard.In the light of the common travel area, however, it is important that the Irish and British visa lists cohere in all practical respects to the extent warranted by immigration concerns.  To this end, Ireland must take serious account of any alterations in the UK regime.  The implications of the UK decision to introduce new visa requirements for nationals of Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland and Venezuela are being examined particularly in the light of the likelihood of persons who would fail the UK test seeking to enter via Ireland.  On the other side, full and immediate consideration will be given the issue of Taiwan and to whether a relaxation of the current regime is desirable based on the approach now being followed by our UK colleagues.I understand that this process will be completed before the coming into force of the new UK arrangements.  Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2004 sets out the purposes for which the Minister can make a visa order, inter alia, ensuring the integrity of the immigration system and for reciprocal immigration arrangements with other states.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1132	I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for coming to the House this evening.  I accept that rent supplement can be beneficial to people who are living in private rented accommodation and cannot provide for the full cost out of their own pocket.  I question, however, the quality of accommodation provided in the private rented sector.I have seen many properties in Dublin South-Central, where people are receiving rent supplement but are forced to live in totally sub-standard flats and houses.  Many landlords receive large sums of money but do not maintain their properties properly.I recently visited a flat in Inchicore where a young mother is living with her three young children.  As soon as the door opened I met a strong damp smell.  There was mould growing on the wall, and even though the woman has three children she has no access to a back garden.  I insisted that the local authority inspect the flat, which it did but following receipt of the report the landlord carried out only minor repairs after many weeks of requests.  This landlord is not answerable for the state of the inadequate accommodation for which he receives more than €1,000 per month.It has also come to my attention that it is over five years since some private rented accommodation in my area was last inspected.  There are many landlords with more than one property.  In one case in my area the landlord receives on average €10,000 per week from the Department of Social and Family Affairs for properties which are in an appalling condition.Rent supplement is allocated by the Minister's Department but is paid out by the community welfare officer.  The officer, however, is not obliged to check out the accommodation before granting rent allowance.  I cannot comprehend how money is being handed over without anyone in authority knowing what they are paying for.The Department of Social and Family Affairs has stated in the past that accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards but this is not being enforced.  The Department has also stated that responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.It is about time that people came into the real world and did something to make landlords accountable for the standard of housing they put up for rent.  There must be regular inspections and the blame cannot and should not be shifted from one Department to the next.  It is simply not acceptable that neither the Department nor the Health Service Executive, HSE, carries out inspections before substantial sums of money are handed over to landlords.Many tenants are so desperate to find accommodation that they do not see the hidden problem until they move in.  Some are afraid to complain to their local authority.  In many cases their landlords evict them if they do.In these challenging economic times the Minister needs to look for value for money.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs should enforce its rules and require full accountability for the millions of euro being paid out on rent supplement each year.  The Government must put in place a new system to require landlords who rent out private accommodation to meet basic hygiene and housing standards.The average weekly rent supplement payment at the end of 2007 was €128.43, and €125.87 at the end of 2008.  In 2008, the Department of Social and Family Affairs spent €441 million on rent supplement for 74,000, up from 60,000 in 2007, 20,000 of whom reside in Dublin, which cost €392 million.  At the end of 2008, 31,343 households were in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Is it not true that rent supplement is designed to be a short-term income support scheme?  Keeping people on rent supplement long term does not make much sense.There has to be a better way to channel State funds into helping people live in acceptable conditions.  The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which Dublin City Council introduced is moving along quickly and helps the long-term needs of those moving on from rent supplement.  More than 780 landlords in Dublin have signed up to the scheme but this is only a drop in the ocean.  The restrictions of the scheme make them reluctant to sign up.There are thousands of vacant apartments in Dublin city.  It is time for the local authorities, together with the relevant Ministers, to examine the possibility of making some of these vacant units available to people who need them.There are 327,000 people on the live register and we hear of more redundancies each day.  With such a dramatic increase in numbers on the dole, the demand for social and affordable housing, and rent supplement is going to sky-rocket.  That is why it is so important for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to act now to address the rent and housing crisis and prevent thousands of euro of taxpayers' money being handed over to line the pockets of many greedy landlords, and to facilitate the many young people living in poor sub-standard conditions with young families and no access to decent accommodation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this issue and for acknowledging the importance of the scheme, the amount of money spent on it and the people who benefit from it.  It is administered on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It is expected that accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  Given the availability of much more rented accommodation now tenants have much more flexibility in moving and finding better accommodation.  That should challenge landlords to ensure that they are meeting the relevant standards.Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.  Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the HSE can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.  Where a notification of non-compliance with standards is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, guidelines recommend that a community welfare officer discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action he or she decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplement.The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The HSE must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appear to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at those premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.  Details of rent supplement tenancies are provided to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a quarterly basis, and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards.The arrangements are aimed at improving the standards of accommodation which rent supplement tenants occupy and support the local authority in meeting their responsibilities on housing standards.  The HSE has indicated that notifications of substandard accommodation received from local authorities have resulted in rent supplement being terminated or the refusal of rent supplement where it was not already in payment.The Government has approved measures to update minimum standards regulations for rental accommodation.  The new regulations took effect from 1 February 2009 and apply in their entirety to all new, first time lettings.  There is a four year phasing-in period for existing properties to allow time to comply with some of the more onerous provisions, such as the installation of dedicated sanitary facilities in each rental unit.  Successful enforcement of the regulations is critical and this responsibility rests with local authorities.  Local authority inspectors inspect rental properties for the purpose of ensuring they comply with the regulations. Where a property does not comply, they engage in a series of sanctions against a landlord, up to and including prosecution in the District Court.The Department is committed to working with and supporting the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in meeting their responsibilities for enforcing housing standards.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1134	It would have been far more appropriate if the Minister for Education and Science were here to take this matter on the Adjournment, because it is such a serious issue.  I was glad to see the Minister for Social and Family Affairs take Deputy Catherine Byrne's matter.  However, I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, has much experience in this area and I appreciate her coming here tonight.During the debate on class sizes a few months ago, virtually every Deputy from the Government side began by saying that they came from classes with more than 30 pupils, and that it did them no harm.  In fact, one Member stated that he came from a class of 42 pupils.  We all know people who came out of those classes who did not quite make it because the type of supports were not there to ensure that they performed to the best of their ability.  Today's announcement by the Minister for Education and Science — who considers himself to be one of the tough guys in the Cabinet — against a group of defenceless, vulnerable children is the most despicable cut of all.  These children have a learning disability.  This means that they cannot learn at the same rate as other children in school for which reason support teachers and special classes are put in place.  We all know the children involved, because we meet them every day on the street, they are our neighbours' children, they are in school with our children or grandchildren.  For an hour a day or an hour a week, they go to a class where they get intensive personalised teaching.By giving these children support, it will ensure they at least have a chance to learn to read, write and be numerate.  If that special support is removed, we will ensure they come out of school without any of those skills.  These skills are necessary to survive in today's world.We did not always have these children in mainstream schools.  We used to have a bus that came into the community every morning, picked them up on each street and went to a special school when it was full.  Those children were not seen anymore until they came back that night.  The parents of those children campaigned, walked the streets and lobbied us until they got the type of support that was necessary in order to ensure their children could go into mainstream education.  They knew what they were talking about, because it was not just about education, but about the socialisation of children with a learning disability.  It was about ensuring that they made friends in school that lasted them through their lives.  It was about ensuring that they mixed with their peers and that they were not ghettoised into special schools.When these children moved into mainstream education, the structure of special schools was dismantled, because there no longer was any need for it.  Therefore, there is no choice for these children.  They are in mainstream education without the supports they need to stay there, but there is no way back for them because the special schools no longer exist.  It is outrageous that this attack is occurring on the most vulnerable of our people.  A republic is not about fine speeches, but about actions.  If this action is what the Government will be judged on, it is an appalling action.  The National Council for Special Education has commissioned a report on special classes, and it has not yet come back with it, but the structure has been destroyed.  These children will now be left floundering next September.  I am seriously disturbed at this action, and I hope that it can be overturned by next September.  It is an appalling decision for any Government to make.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1135	I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter, because it provides us with an opportunity to clarify a few issues.  I will take the Adjournment matter this evening on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, which is about the decision of the Department to suppress a number of mild general learning disability classes in primary schools.A total of 128 classes are being suppressed in 119 schools, and a total of 534 children are enrolled in these classes at the moment.  Allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for mild general learning disability, the normal pupil-teacher ratio that applies is 11 to one.  However, the Department allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum.  Therefore, these schools are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.  The 119 schools from whom the teaching posts are now being removed received allocations under the general allocation model of teaching support.  These schools have therefore been resourced for the categories of pupils in question.  I must point out that eight of these classes had no such pupils, ten had only one and more than half of them had five pupils or fewer.Some 3,000 schools that do not have special classes for pupils with mild general learning disability still meet the needs of these children through mainstream classes and the use of their general allocation teaching resources.  Furthermore, some schools in recent years voluntarily disbanded such classes and mainstreamed the pupils with the associated loss of the mild special class post.  Some 80 of the 119 schools already have reduced class sizes under DEIS or previous disadvantage schemes.  Some 17 of those schools will get an additional post when the pupils in question are divided among mainstream classes.  Essentially, the loss of a teaching post from the mild class will be offset by the addition of a post to maintain the lower class size to which such schools are entitled as a consequence of their disadvantage categorisation.  The pupils from the 128 classes in question will be placed in mainstream classes and will receive support from their class teacher.  Those in disadvantaged schools with reduced pupil-teacher ratios will benefit from small class sizes.  As Deputy Lynch suggested, all schools will benefit from the support that is available to them through the schools general allocation model.  As I have already said, primary schools that do not have classes for children with mild general learning disabilities cater for such pupils from within the general allocation model.In recent years, there has been an unprecedented investment in the provision of supports to children with special needs.  In our schools, approximately 19,000 adults are working solely with children with special needs.  There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools.  There were just 2,000 such teachers in 1998.  Over 1,000 other teachers support children in the special schools that continue to operate throughout the country.  The 76 classes for children with mild general learning disabilities in which there are nine or more children are to be retained.  I emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs.  As I said earlier, the establishment of classes for children with mild general learning disabilities predates many of the developments in special education policy over recent years.  The general allocation model now offers us a system for supporting schools that have children with high incidence special needs.  I hope my clarification has been of assistance to Deputy Lynch.  I thank her for raising this issue on the Adjournment tonight.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1137	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.We will continue to pursue this issue in conjunction with Department of Health and Children, at EU level in the context of the current review. In the meantime products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on   product origin.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1138	The dairy sector is facing a period of market volatility across the globe at present resulting from supply/demand disequilibrium in international markets.  Having reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008, dairy product prices and producer prices also peaked in that time.  Since then international dairy product prices have fallen back considerably, although the average Irish producer price for 2008 was similar to the 2007 price.  Indications are that markets will remain weak in the first half of 2009 and it looks like being a challenging year for the dairy sector.During the Health Check negotiations I argued very strongly in favour of keeping critical market instruments in place and using them effectively.  These support measures can now be used to respond to price volatility in the current market situation and will help support the dairy sector in Ireland.  The wisdom of that approach is now evident and the retention of the intervention system for butter and SMP, as well as the Private Storage Scheme for butter, can now be utilised for the benefit of the entire sector.  Indeed, in view of the market difficulties, I made clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel that the activation of the full range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under current market prices.  The Commission initially responded by commencing the 2009 butter private storage scheme two months early.  Then, on January 15th, the Commissioner announced further measures to assist the dairy sector.  These included a commitment under the Intervention system to purchase more than the fixed quantities of butter (30,000 tonnes) and Skimmed Milk Powder (109,000 tonnes) if the market situation requires it.  In addition, she announced the reintroduction of export refunds for butter, milk powders and cheese and these were reinstated at the milk management committee meeting on 22nd January.  Irish operators can now avail of these refunds and my Department will continue to examine the position and urge the Commission to set the refunds at an appropriate level to support the dairy sector.While we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  The main international forecasting organisations predict global growth in wealth and population in the medium term.  This will present new opportunities for quality producers like Ireland, and all areas of the dairy sector can expect to reap the rewards.  One of the major challenges in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agri-food sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market, which is focused on quality and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.As part of this overall strategy, my Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing.  A total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings.  This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new valued added products.In the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	The sheep sector already benefits significantly from the main schemes operated by my Department.  Sheep farmers receive an estimated annual:€126 million from the Single Farm Payment,€60 million under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and€84 million under REPS.In addition to this support and following the Sheep Strategy Report, a number of other measures have also been put in place to further assist the sector.Additional support to the sheep sector is being considered in light of the outcome of the recent CAP Health Check. One of my primary objectives in the Health check negotiations was to get access to unspent funds within the EU's agriculture budget for use by Member States with a wide range of discretion.  This was achieved in the final deal and, as a result, Ireland will receive additional funds amounting to approximately €7m in 2009 (from the national reserve) and €29m in subsequent years.I am currently considering how these funds can best be used to develop Irish agriculture within the terms laid down in the EU regulations.  As part of this process I asked for and received submissions from four farm organisations.  The proposals made include a top-up to the SFP for sheep farmers, a hogget ewe premium, a sheep maintenance payment for all ewes, and a dairy income support scheme linked to milk quota volume.Some of these proposals are linked to suggestions for the use of €120m additional modulation funds, also arising from the Health Check, on which a separate consultation process is underway, and to which different EU rules apply.  The closing date for these submissions is 16 February, and therefore it is not yet possible to indicate the range of proposals in this case.All submissions received will be examined carefully, and will be a useful input to the decisions on these matters, which I expect to announce in the near future.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.There is also the issue where a primary product can enter Ireland and be processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded, as an Irish product, this is known as "substantial transformation" This terminology originates in WTO, CODEX and EU Legislation governing the EU Custom Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products. This was one of the principal points made to the European Commission in the context of our request for their approval of our proposed national arrangements.We will continue to pursue this issue in conjunction with Department of Health and Children, at EU level in the context of the current review. We are pressing for the inclusion of a requirement to indicate the origin of primary ingredients in finished products. In the meantime products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1142	In general, Ireland's national herd covering all farm species meets very high health standards and very good progress has been made in recent years in dealing with regulated diseases such as BSE and Brucellosis.  However, less progress has been made in relation to non- regulated diseases. While the losses to agriculture arising from these latter diseases vary from farm to farm and are not easily quantifiable, it is accepted that less than optimal animal health leads to inefficiencies in production resulting in reduced quantity and poorer quality of farm output, thus reducing the competitive position of individual farmers, their incomes and the agri-food industry generally.My Department has been actively progressing an initiative to further improve the health of the national herd and flock for many years and this was given added impetus by the inclusion in the Programme for Government of a commitment to introduce a herd health initiative to deal with non-regulated diseases. To advance these objectives, I recently launched Animal Health Ireland which aims to improve overall animal health standards, thereby enhancing on-farm productivity and securing improved profitability for farmers through a coordinated national approach to animal health.The main priority of Animal Health Ireland will be to identify and prioritise non-regulated disease conditions that impact negatively from both a financial and disease perspective on Irish livestock, excluding those already covered by regulation. It will be managed by a Steering Group that will act as the Board of the organisation. I recently appointed Mr Mike Magan as chairman of the interim Steering Group whose other members comprise individuals with skills and competencies such as livestock farming, veterinary science, agricultural economics and international marketing. The Steering Group will report to a Stakeholders Group which will be representative of farming bodies, dairy co-ops and service providers and will have overall responsibility for the strategic direction, structure and financing of the organisation. The organisation will have a small number of Executive staff who will be responsible for implementing agreed strategies and I have assigned a number of executive staff to the new organisation for an interim period. Future arrangements for the Steering Group, staffing and organisation of the body, will be a matter for the industry.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1143	The representatives of the polyvalent (multi-purpose) vessels in the Irish fleet sought an increased share of Ireland's mackerel quota for 2009, while the representatives of the Refrigerated Salt Water (RSW) fleet, based in the north-west opposed any increase in the share for the polyvalent vessels.  The background to the situation is that the allocation arrangements were last revised in 2001.  Since 2001 the polyvalent vessels have had an allocation of 7,000 tonnes of mackerel from Ireland's quota.  This 7,000 tonnes represented 10% of the Irish quota when the arrangements were put in place in 2001.  In all years, except 2002, the Irish mackerel quota has fallen well below the 2001 level (as low as 46,000 in 2005) and the allocation to the polyvalent vessels has remained at the set level of 7,000 tonnes.  The cuts in the quota each year were borne in total by the RSW Pelagic segment vessels. In 2009 the mackerel quota has been increased to 66,068 tonnes which remains below the 2001 quota when the share out arrangement was last determined.In the context of the representations made in relation to the share out of mackerel, Minister Killeen organised a meeting with all interested parties on 26th of November to hear the case for (i) a continuation of the current arrangements and (ii) for granting to the Polyvalent fleet an increased share of the 2009 mackerel quota.  Strong and comprehensive presentations were made at that meeting by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFO) and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (KFO) in respect of both proposals.  Following the meeting, the Minister requested clarification and additional information from both parties, which were received.Minister Killeen examined the cases made and considered in detail the issues arising.  Following this full consideration, Minister Killeen decided to introduce new arrangements for the share out of mackerel for 2009 and future years.  Under the new arrangements, the polyvalent segment will be allocated 13% of the mackerel quota.  For 2009 this will involve a total allocation of 8,562 tonnes for the polyvalent fleet rather than the 7,000 tonne set allocation in place heretofore.  This allocation for 2009 involves a 22.3% increase for the polyvalent segment.It is important to note that the mackerel quota is of substantial importance to the north-west based pelagic industry which is completely dependent on pelagic fish stocks, such as mackerel and do not have any access to whitefish, prawn and other stocks which are available to the polyvalent vessels.  As the mackerel quota is a set quantity for Ireland any increase in the allocation to the polyvalent fishing vessels must be at the expense of those vessels in the RSW Pelagic vessels and accordingly changes in allocation arrangement must take account of the importance of fishing in both the south — west and the north — west and balance the interests of both communities.

My request was for advance payment at a rate of 50%, payable from 16 October 2008.The reason for my request was based on the very adverse weather conditions being experienced in Ireland.I am pleased to say that the European Commission responded favourably and the advance payment of 50% of the Single Payment effective issued from 16 October. I believe that these advance payment went some way in alleviating the difficulties faced by farmers due to the exceptional weather conditions. The balance of Single Farm Payments issued in early December.

In particular, the Bill will amend and consolidate previous legislation to reflect the changed disease status of our animals and update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that penalties for offenders are increased significantly. The proposed legislation will also provide for the consolidation of responsibility for the welfare of all animals within my Department.My officials have met with a wide range of organisations that made submissions on the draft Bill following the public consultation process initiated by me last year. This element of the process provided an opportunity for parties to elaborate on their respective submissions. Drafting of the bill is now continuing taking account of the further comments received.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1146	The new REPS 4 scheme allows grassland farmers to apply for REPS even if they are operating above the general limit of 170 kgs of organic nitrogen per hectare laid down in the Nitrates Directive, provided that they apply for a nitrates derogation. In 2008, 603 REPS 4 farmers applied for a derogation.I welcome the fact that more intensive farmers are joining REPS, as it means that our most productive farming is being carried out within a framework of prescribed environmental standards.

A number of applications for foreshore consents currently on hand cannot be progressed without valuation.  The Department of Finance has now given my Department sanction to obtain the services of valuers from the private sector subject to conditions.  These conditions and procedural issues are currently being examined as a matter of urgency.  I expect my Department will be in a position to engage the necessary valuers shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1148	I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 89 together.A first policy debate on the future of the CAP after 2013 took place at the informal meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Annecy in September last.  In the initial debate, there was general agreement on the global context in which policy thinking must be developed.  All the ministers present were concerned about global food security, increasing environmental pressures and the impact of climate change; factors which have been reflected in recent food price volatility.  While a large majority of Member States favoured maintaining a strong EU agriculture policy, there were differences in emphasis from different Member States.The French Presidency took the discussion forward at a specially convened Council in November 2008 at which it presented a series of draft conclusions for discussion by Ministers.  The draft brought together aspirations on a number of broad challenges and generally understood principles on future CAP policy.  It took on board the commitments made in the final Health Check negotiations to further simplification and to address the differing levels of direct payments between Member States.  It also pledged that the conclusions were without prejudice to discussions on the Financial Perspectives.  Unanimous agreement could not be reached on the conclusions put forward by the Presidency and they were therefore agreed as Presidency, rather than Council, conclusions.The Czech Presidency has signalled that its main priority will be to continue discussions on the future of the CAP including an examination of direct payments with a particular focus on the differences between Member States and the system of payments.My own view, which I have expressed at meetings of the Council and bilaterally to my Ministerial colleagues, is that we must maintain a strong agricultural production base in the European Union in the future to take account of the challenges ahead in meeting increased demands for food.  Any reduction in food production in the EU would be taken up elsewhere where less efficient production systems exist and would result in a heavier carbon footprint.  We must also undertake food production and distribution in a manner that is sustainable in all its dimensions — economically, socially and environmentally.There will be major challenges ahead from climate change, increased competition on world and EU markets, the financial crunch and other factors. We must ensure that we have the capacity to cope with the challenges and fully exploit the opportunities as they emerge.  To do so our whole sector, from farm to fork, must be highly efficient and competitive. It must also be innovative, producing the products that changing consumer tastes demand, and it must be relentlessly focused on quality and safety.To achieve these objectives, there is a continuing need for an active and appropriately resourced European agricultural policy.That policy needs to recognise the role that a cohesive agriculture & rural development policy can play in addressing future energy needs, addressing environmental concerns and providing a secure and sustainable food supply in Europe.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1149	The EU Commission has now brought forward proposals for a new European Fisheries Control system which allows for the application of administrative action or criminal proceedings in conformity with national law.The possibility of introducing administrative sanctions for fisheries offences in Ireland was comprehensively considered, including an examination of practices in other Member States, at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill through the Oireachtas.The position taken by the Minister at that time was based on legal advice from the Attorney General.  I consider that under this new EU Commission proposal there is a possibility of introducing administrative sanctions and a penalty points system for Irish vessels and I have sought legal advice to determine if the current EU Commission proposal could accommodate their introduction here in Ireland.It is worth noting that the proposal from the EU Commission envisages penalties up to a maximum of €600,000 for repeated serious infringement and under the penalty point system the suspension of a fishing licence for prolonged periods, and even the permanent withdrawal of a licence.  These penalties are substantially higher than the level provided for in Irish legislation.

Any such appeal must then be considered by the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.The timeframe for reaching a determination in respect of applications will vary depending on location, species, scale and intensity of production, culture method, statutory status of sites, potential visual impact, access route and frequency of access to sites, other activities in the area etc. This does not include consideration of any submissions or observations raised during the public consultation period.In the circumstances it is not possible to indicate a specific timeframe for the processing of such applications.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1152	The Nitrates Regulations (SI No. 378 of 2006) are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance. The objective of the Regulations is to protect water quality and the various provisions are designed to control the management of fertilisers, including the timing, method of application and maximum amounts that may be applied, in order to prevent fertiliser losses to water.The EU Nitrates Directive requires Member States' Action Programmes to include rules regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. Therefore the Nitrates Regulations had to specify prohibited periods during which fertilisers may not be applied to land. The purpose of these prohibited periods is to ensure that fertilisers are not applied at times of the year when crops are not growing and not able to use them, and when there is a high risk of those fertilisers finding their way into waters instead. Outside of these prohibited periods, fertilisers may be applied to land provided that weather and ground conditions are suitable and that any buffer zones, as specified in the Regulations, are respected.The contents of the Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were the subject of extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the farming bodies, and were finalised following a long period of negotiation with the EU Commission. At the conclusion of this process, the Nitrates Regulations (SI No. 378 of 2006) were made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2006 to further implement the EU Nitrates Directive.The provisions in relation to landspreading, including the dates of the prohibited periods, are fundamental measures in meeting the objectives of the Directive, which is to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources. Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme (Nitrates Regulations) is subject to review,with a new Action Programme to be published by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by 30.6.2010.This publication will be preceded by a consultation process, during which there will be opportunity for all stakeholders to comment on the current Programme and its implementation by means of the Nitrates Regulations.

The grant-aid will benefit 66 enterprises and is expected to contribute to an actual investment on projects in the region of €70 million across the horticulture, livestock marts and small meat sectors.These investments will help to improve the competitiveness and added-value of agricultural products through improved processing facilities as well as improving storage, handling and marketing facilities at ‘near farm' enterprises. The geographic spread of the beneficiaries will generate significant economic activity throughout the country over the next few years and will create significant employment during the construction stage of the new facilities. In addition to improving the competitiveness of Irish agriculture the investments will ensure that the Irish public has on-going access to the freshest, locally grown food in the interests of public health and well-being.In the Horticulture sector, the grant aid is targeted at 13 projects which are primarily investing in developments required by the multiple retailers, so as to ensure a continued outlet for growers' produce. As well as improving viability and profitability within the sector, the investments will raise quality and environmental standards, develop value added lines, expand markets, improve labour productivity and increase marketable yield.In the Livestock Marts sector, the 22 investments being supported will impact positively on the environment by providing marts with adequate slurry storage and treatment facilities. In a number of cases the grant aid will assist in improving current procedures within the existing mart premises and contribute to the health status of animals being sold through the marts.In the Small Meat sector, which includes small slaughterhouses and low throughput meat establishments, 31 projects are being supported which will assist food business operators in the sector to improve efficiency, add quality and value to products, produce new and innovative products and develop new markets.

The World Economic Forum at Davos last month provided no new momentum for the negotiations and the next key event will be the G20 meeting in London in April.Against that background I, my officials and my colleagues in Government have continued to pursue Ireland's interests in the negotiations with the Commission and other Member States at every opportunity at co-ordination meetings in Geneva, at the Article 133 Committee in Brussels and at the recent meeting of Trade Ministers.

Bord Bia has a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and services to assist Irish food and drink companies build additional business in Euro zone countries.  Bord Bia research has prioritised key target markets in Euro zone countries for prepared foods and identified opportunities for cheese and dairy ingredients as the dairy sector continues to seek out new markets.  The recent establishment by Bord Bia of a full-time presence in Shanghai, servicing the Asian region, and the relocation of the US office to New York reflect continued growth potential in these regions.In order to facilitate the full return to normal exports of Irish pigmeat, Bord Bia has also  put in place a Market Recovery Campaign to build on the reassurances already provided to customers since the product recall.  The campaign will include a customer reassurance programme, bilateral veterinary meetings in selected markets within Europe where appropriate, a trade communications programme to position the capability of the Irish pigmeat sector and initiatives to maximise international market access for Irish pigmeat products.

The last confirmed case was disclosed in April 2006. If no case of Brucellosis is disclosed between now and March 2009, my Department will apply to the EU Commission for Official Brucellosis Free status in April 2009. At that stage, I would envisage a relaxation of some of the programme's control measures which will reduce the burden on farmers of testing and movement controls. However, given the nature of the disease and as Brucellosis continues to exist in Northern Ireland, we will be adopting a cautious approach to reducing controls and any reduction will be phased over a number of years and will be based on an assessment of the risks involved.I must emphasise that any new outbreaks of the disease between now and April next could jeopardise the attainment of officially free status. Consequently, I would urge all involved to continue to comply with the control and testing arrangements that remain in place and to exercise caution when sourcing replacement female animals.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1163	The EU has agreed two measures with potential total support of €35.7 million. The first measure allows temporary storage of 30,000 tonnes of product for up to 6 months at a potential cost of €15 million. The second measure allows support of €20.7 million to the costs of the disposal scheme adopted following the dioxin incident.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1164	I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.The CAP Health Check agreement last November represented a very positive outcome for the Irish dairy sector, and the milk quota elements of the final package will be particularly beneficial to milk producers in this country.It was agreed that quotas will be increased by 1% per year for the next five years, commencing on 1 April 2009.  This increase comes on top of the 2% increase already implemented in 2008.  In addition, there will be an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism in 2009 that will generate the equivalent of a further 2% increase in the national quota. Taking all of these together, there will be a cumulative increase in Ireland's quota by 2014 of 9.3%, or almost 500 million litres, compared to 2007.I believe the agreed combination of quota increases and butterfat correction allows Ireland to prepare properly for quota abolition in 2015. I say this for two reasons. The first is that our additional production potential places us in a position to derive the maximum possible benefit from the quota increases over the next five years. The second is that my efforts to encourage greater efficiency at producer and processor levels will continue so that maximum added value from the quota increases can be achieved and the Irish dairy sector will continue to be well-placed to compete on international dairy markets into the future.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1165	The Common Agricultural Policy contains various market support measures for the dairy sector.  The initial CAP Health Check proposals had planned to abolish or weaken most of these.  During the negotiations I argued very strongly in favour of keeping critical market instruments in place and using them effectively.  These support measures can now be used to respond to price volatility in the current market situation and will help support the dairy sector in Ireland.Dairy product prices reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008 and producer prices also peaked in that time.  Most CAP market instruments were suspended as they were not necessary at that time.  Since then international dairy product prices have fallen back considerably, although the average Irish producer price for 2008 was only marginally down on the 2007 price.  Indications are that markets will remain weak in the first half of 2009 and I made clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel that a range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under market prices.The Commission initially responded by commencing the 2009 butter private storage scheme two months early.  Subsequently, on January 15th the Commissioner announced further measures to assist the dairy sector.  These included a commitment under the Intervention system to purchase more than the fixed quantities of butter (30,000 tonnes) and Skimmed Milk Powder (109,000 tonnes) if the market situation requires it.  In addition, she announced the reintroduction of export refunds for butter, milk powders and cheese and these were reinstated at the milk management committee meeting on 22nd January.  Irish operators can now avail of these refunds and my Department will continue to examine the position and urge the Commission to set the refunds at an appropriate level to support the dairy sector.The activation of these measures will take some time to influence commercial markets and stimulate demand for dairy products.  It should be noted that market measures alone will not be sufficient.  Dairy farmers incomes are comprised of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  Market forces have a major influence on the price paid for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from international markets of dairy product sales.  Therefore, nobody can predict precisely what the minimum or maximum milk price will be as it is determined by market forces.While we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  Global growth in wealth and population will provide opportunities for quality producers like Ireland, and all areas of the dairy sector can expect to reap the rewards.  In the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.

A case has been made for other products manufactured in Ireland and that were affected by the product recall to be considered for assistance. These would include products containing both Irish and imported pigmeat and products made here using solely imported pigmeat that, at the time of the recall, could not be segregated satisfactorily to facilitate its sale. My Department is currently considering the position of such products.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1167	The main organic food promotion event this year will be National Organic Week, which will be held for the fifth year in a row this September. The National Organic Awards will take place in conjunction with National Organic Week.Bord Bia, in collaboration with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, have invited a number of organic companies to exhibit at Biofach, the World Organic Trade Fair in Nuremberg later this month. This export driven initiative was one of the actions outlined in the Organic Marketing Plan 2006-2009. Biofach is the largest and most important trade event for organic food in the international calendar. The objective of this initiative is to increase the profile of indigenous Irish organic products on the international stage.Bord Bia are also facilitating a number of non-exhibiting Irish food companies to attend this Trade Fair to show them at first hand the scale of the development of the organic sector worldwide. I would be hopeful that their attendance will encourage the development of a range of new innovative organic products. This in turn could lead to increases on the supply side in Ireland in line with my Department's Organic Farming Production Plan 2008-2012 launched last year.The total cost to my Department of these initiatives will be in the region of €300,000.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1169	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 131 together.The package of measures agreed at the December 2008 EU Fisheries Council were in my opinion the best possible deal available to Ireland in what were very challenging circumstances.The main elements of the package include an increase of 5% in the value of quotas available to Ireland from €194m to €200m and the successful defence of the Hague Preferences against determined opposition from some Member States.The EU Commission's proposals for complete closure of all whitefish fisheries in the waters off Donegal were successfully renegotiated and agreement was reached on a package of measures which both delivers strong conservation measures for the cod, whiting and haddock stocks in decline while facilitating the continuation of important fishing activities for the Irish fleet in the area.  In addition, the Council established effort limits under the EU Cod Recovery Plan Regulation (Council 1342/2008) for the Irish Sea and for the waters off Donegal.  I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the  Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1170	As the Deputy will be aware since my appointment as Minister I consistently requested the EU Commission to raise the age for BSE Testing in the light of the on-going reduction in case numbers and the ages of confirmed cases.  Consequently, I warmly welcomed the decision to raise the testing age of both animals slaughtered for human consumption as well as emergency slaughtered and fallen animals from 30 to 48 months. This came into effect on the 1st January 2009.The costs associated with BSE testing of cattle being slaughtered for human consumption at meat plants are for the most part, borne by the industry. Consequently, most of the savings arising from the reduced level of testing at these locations will accrue to the industry including farmers. It is estimated that the number of cattle to be tested will fall by about 400,000 a year and will result in annual savings of more than €8 in testing costs.This decision also enhances Ireland's standing abroad and is a vindication of the position I advocated when I identified the increase in the minimum age for BSE testing as a priority.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1174	The information requested by the Deputy is shown in the following table.200320042005200620072008Number of aquaculture licence applications received587073683826Number of aquaculture licences granted23383425101Number of Aquaculture licences granted by Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board293130The figures provided do not include renewal, assignment, revocation, amendment or review of licences.  Licences issued by the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board follow on from appeals of decisions made by the Minister.In considering an application for an aquaculture licence, including an application to renew an aquaculture licence, the licensing authority must consider:the potential impacts on safety and navigation,the ecological impacts on wild fisheries, natural habitats, flora and fauna,the suitability of the waters,the other beneficial uses of the place or waters,the likely effects on the economy of the area, andthe statutory status under European legal frameworks of the area under application.This process involves consultation with a range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  Applications are also subject to public consultation whereby any interested person or body may make submissions or observations on any licence application.  The process also involves publication of Ministerial decisions on applications and allowing a one month period for appeal of any decision.   Any such appeal must then be considered by the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.The reduction in the number of new licences issued in 2008 arises from the need for full compliance with the requirements of EU legislation and in particular the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.My Department is working actively with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EU Commission to agree future procedures to ensure that all applications for aquaculture licences are fully compliant with the requirements of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  €1.46 million has been set aside specifically to support compliance of fisheries and aquaculture with respect to activities in Natura 2000 sites.Reaching early agreement with the EU Commission on how to enable licences to be issued in Natura 2000 sites in compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives is a very high priority for my Department.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1178	The EU Fisheries Councils in November and December 2008 adopted a new Cod Recovery Plan, as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008 and Annex IIa of the 2009 TAC and Quota Regulation (EC) No 43/2009. These Regulations are applicable to the fishing fleets of all Member States fishing with specified fishing gears in the relevant sea areas. Under these Regulations, Ireland and other relevant Member States are required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage its allocation of fishing effort — days at sea limits in areas VIa (north west of Ireland) and VIIa (the Irish Sea) for vessels using specified gear types.At the December Council, the EU Commission's proposals for complete closure of all whitefish fisheries in the waters off Donegal were successfully renegotiated and agreement was reached on a package of measures which both delivers strong conservation measures for the cod, whiting and haddock stocks in decline while facilitating the continuation of important fishing activities for the Irish fleet in the area.Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, the Department introduced a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort for the period 1 February 2009 to 30 April 2009.I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the  Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Department and agencies  to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures. The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am happy to make amendments where proposed by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) within the legal framework that has been established.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1179	The representatives of the polyvalent (multipurpose) vessels in the Irish fleet sought an increased share of Ireland's mackerel quota for 2009, while the representatives of the Refrigerated Salt Water (RSW) fleet, based in the north-west opposed any increase in the share for the polyvalent vessels.  The background to the situation is that the allocation arrangements were last revised in 2001.  Since 2001 the polyvalent vessels have had an allocation of 7,000 tonnes of mackerel from Ireland's quota.  This 7,000 tonnes represented 10% of the Irish quota when the arrangements were put in place in 2001.  In all years, except 2002, the Irish mackerel quota has fallen well below the 2001 level (as low as 46,000 in 2005) and the allocation to the polyvalent vessels has remained at the set level of 7,000 tonnes.  The cuts in the quota each year were borne in total by the RSW Pelagic segment vessels. In 2009 the mackerel quota has been increased to 66,068 tonnes which remains below the 2001 quota when the share out arrangement was last determined.In the context of the representations made in relation to the share out of mackerel, Minister Killeen organised a meeting with all interested parties on 26th of November to hear the case for (i) a continuation of the current arrangements and (ii) for granting to the Polyvalent fleet an increased share of the 2009 mackerel quota.  Strong and comprehensive presentations were made at that meeting by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFO) and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (KFO) in respect of both proposals.  Following the meeting, the Minister  requested clarification and additional information from both parties, which were received.Minister Killeen examined the cases made and considered in detail the issues arising.  Following this full consideration, Minister Killeen decided to introduce new arrangements for the share out of mackerel for 2009 and future years.  Under the new arrangements, the polyvalent segment will be allocated 13% of the mackerel quota.   For 2009 this will involve a total allocation of 8,562 tonnes for the polyvalent fleet rather than the 7,000 tonne set allocation in place heretofore.  This allocation for 2009 involves a 22.3% increase  for the polyvalent segment.It is important to note that the mackerel quota is of substantial importance to the north-west based pelagic industry  which is completely dependent on pelagic fish stocks, such as mackerel  and do not have any  access to whitefish, prawn and other stocks which are available to the polyvalent vessels.  As the mackerel quota is a set quantity for Ireland any increase in the allocation to the polyvalent fishing vessels must be at the expense of those vessels in the RSW Pelagic vessels and accordingly changes in allocation arrangement must take account of the importance of fishing in both the south — west and the north — west and balance the interests of both communities.

In terms of additional payments to farmers, the deal itself is worth over €90 million over the coming years. This money arises as a result of the agreement secured by Member States to utilise unspent Single Farm Payment funds. Heretofore these funds could not be accessed because of the complex rules surrounding the Single Payment arrangements.  In addition, the increase in milk quotas will deliver an estimated €100 million worth of additional milk production by the year 2014. This was an outstanding achievement by any standards considering the alignment of forces on the Council.

It is comprised of stakeholders from all sectors of the industry as well as representatives from the relevant state agencies and from my Department.This group is charged with overseeing and driving the  implementation of the recommendations contained in the Cawley Report. Substantial progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the current decommissioning scheme which was one of the key recommendations of the Cawley Report. A total of 45 vessels have accepted offers.  €21m was spent in 2008 with an estimated €16m to be spent in 2009.  A significant economic benefit currently estimated at some €22m will accrue to the remainder of the fleet from the redistribution of the prawn and whitefish catch previously taken by the decommissioned vessels.Other progress includes; developing marketing opportunities for Irish seafood, work on the establishment of the Seafood Development Centre, publication of a draft lobster management plan, establishment of the Step Up Programme to incentivise consolidation and prioritise support for the development of seafood businesses, ongoing development of an industry focused Environmental Management System for the wild-capture seafood sector, encouraging use of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient fishing by way of grant aid, increased training opportunities in the sea fisheries, aquaculture and shore-based sectors.The Cawley Report recommendations and their indicated funding are underpinned by the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 — 2013.I am confident that, with the buy in and participation of the key stakeholders in the implementation process, progress will continue to be made and the goals set out in the Cawley Report will be achieved.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1190	The Irish agri-food and fisheries sector is operating in a global market that is experiencing significant challenges and unprecedented change and at the same time  providing significant long term opportunities.  Despite the well documented challenges in the global market, I believe that this indigenous industry has the potential to boost export returns and approach €10 billion in annual export revenues by 2011, as has been targeted by Bord Bia.  The strongest growth potential exists in dairy, prepared foods, beef, alcoholic beverages and seafood sectors.The role of my Department and its agencies is to assist this industry to maximise the return from these opportunities.  A number of strategic initiatives have been taken to help the agri-food sector achieve its potential including capital investment schemes for the food processing sectors, fisheries, innovation and research and development.Addressing the industry's capacity to compete successfully at home and overseas has assumed a new urgency and my belief is that a new development plan for the period to 2020 is required to maintain the impetus gained from the Agri-Vision 2015 strategy.  My Department has already started the preparatory work on this plan which is focusing on the opportunities arising from a growing international food and energy crop markets, the challenges from the global economic downturn, currency fluctuations, climate change and the critical issue of competitiveness.

The applications received under the Scheme are being processed by my Department up to the level of funding available.

In addition to specific allocations for quality assurance measures and healthy eating initiatives, Bord Bia has a marketing and promotional budget for 2009 of €20m.  This has enabled Bord Bia to implement a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and tailored services to assist Irish food and drink companies build additional business in Europe.In addition, an inter-Departmental Market Access Group comprising representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara is currently engaged in a co-ordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1193	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 144 together.My Department has been actively progressing an initiative to improve the health of the national herd and flock for many years and this was given added impetus by the inclusion in the Programme for Government of a commitment to introduce a herd health initiative to deal with non-regulated diseases.  To advance these objectives, I recently launched Animal Health Ireland which aims to improve overall animal health standards, thereby enhancing on-farm productivity and securing improved profitability for farmers through a coordinated national approach to animal health.  The main stakeholders are fully supportive of this initiative and have agreed to financially support it.The function of Animal Health Ireland (AHI) will be to:develop effective national plans for action in the area of unregulated diseasecoordinate and prioritise research projects and initiatives in respect of action programmes undertakenbuild upon and coordinate the national infrastructure that will enable industry, at all levels, to take appropriate and effective action.My Department will meet some initial costs of AHI and will provide a small number of Executive staff to assist the interim Steering Group, currently being chaired by Mr Mike Magan.  This Group, which has been selected on the basis of competencies, will oversee the initiative and a Stakeholders Group comprising representatives of the organisations that are co-financing it will in turn oversee the Steering Group.  Work has commenced on the administrative arrangements to be put in place to support AHI, which will operate independently of my Department.Animal Health Ireland represents a significant change from the long-established Government-led model that has characterised animal health policy to date in Ireland.  AHI provides a unique opportunity to develop an improved understanding of current practices and future trends in international best practice in the area of herd health and affords those organisations — including farmers, producers, processors, and support/advisory service — actively participating in the project to build on the significant resources, informational infrastructure, capabilities and expertise already available within the range of organisations.  And following on from that, developing a national strategy to take appropriate action in the area of non-regulatory animal health which in effect will allow industry to a large extent shape its own future.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1195	I am very concerned with the level of farm safety on our farms.  Last year 21 people died on Irish farms and this year to-date 3 people have died on Irish farms.  I strongly support the work of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), which is the national body in Ireland with responsibility for securing health and safety at work.In 2002 the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee was established.  This Committee is made up of representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc, HSA and other farming groups and supports and co-ordinates the majority of research and promotional activities in relation to farm safety.  Throughout 2008 this Committee developed a Farm Safety Action Plan for the period 2009-2012, which was launched by my colleague Mr. Billy Kelleher T.D., Minister for Labour Affairs, in December 2008.  This Plan sets out ambitious goals and actions to raise national awareness of occupational safety and health in agriculture and to reduce fatalities and accidents on Irish farms.I fully support the HSA in the implementation of this new Farm Safety Action Plan 2009-2012 and my Department has committed to:Include a link on DAFF's website to the "Farm Safety Section" of the Health and Safety Authorities website.Ensure that Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) training courses will address farm safety issues as they arise under particular REPS Measures.Incorporate appropriate health and safety aspects in DAFF's farm building specifications when they are being drafted/revised.Support farm safety week/month and to issue timely press statements on a relevant topic to highlight the need for health and safety awareness in agriculture.

My Department has provided the necessary services to facilitate the live export trade on Saturdays at the export assembly locations.  Nevertheless and in line with all services being provided by Government Departments, it is essential that the required service is provided in the most cost effective and efficient manner and in a way that enables exporters meet Saturday sailing schedules.  Against this background, my Department is currently reviewing all aspects of this service.  While this review is under way, my Department continues to provide necessary services on Saturdays at existing export assembly locations, as heretofore.

Initially, these payments were made from residual funds in my Department's Vote at the end of each year.  However, specific provisions for this purpose have been included in my Department's Estimates in recent years.  Ex gratia funding is intended only as a contribution to the overall costs of these largely voluntary organisations, which operate throughout the country in both urban and rural areas.The level of support provided in recent years is as follows:YearTotal AmountNumber of organisations funded€m20051.2068620061.2219420071.47910720081.250110

My Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on the implications for the Department's Vote and the details that will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume next month.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1200	The considerable potential of the Irish aquaculture sector to create wealth and jobs in coastal communities has been recognised by the Government for some time.  The Seafood Strategy, Steering a New Course — Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013,  identifies a much bigger role for aquaculture in meeting the increasing demand for seafood and sets down a number of recommendations that will deliver significant development and expansion of the aquaculture sector.  That strategy has been translated into a series of detailed actions and schemes and these have been incorporated in the non co-funded Fisheries Operational Programme 2007-2013.A provision of  €5 million has been made in my Department's Vote to support Aquaculture development in 2009.  It is planned to roll out a number of actions to assist the development of aquaculture and draw down the available funds in the near future.

For poultry products imported from outside the EU these must come from plants approved under the European Union veterinary inspection regime and having equivalent standards as that within the EU.  There is a set of inspection procedures in place to ensure compliance with the relevant requirements.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1203	Under the European Economic Recovery Plan the EU Commission has proposed that an amount of €1.5 billion should be made available to all Member States in their Rural Development Programmes via the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  One third of this amount (€0.5 billion) is proposed to be spent on new challenges related operations, being climate change adaptation and mitigation, renewable energies, water management, biodiversity, innovation measures relating to these areas and the restructuring of the dairy sector.  The remaining two thirds (€1 billion) is proposed to be allocated to developing broadband internet infrastructure in rural areas.It is particularly important to me that Ireland should receive a fair share of these funds, reflecting our traditionally high spend on rural development measures.  I am also anxious to ensure that there should be reasonable flexibility allowed to Member States in how these funds are used within the rural development programme, which includes some of our largest agricultural schemes.The Recovery Plan is still under negotiation within the Community and the outcome of this process and the potential amount available for Irish agriculture will not be known for some time.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1204	REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS.  Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments.  The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  These include checks on areas and on the plan details and the controls have to satisfy stringent  EU regulatory and audit requirements.Many REPS 4 plans have been prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department. The information on these plans is in computerised format and it was necessary to develop an appropriate computer based control system for checking these plans. This was a lengthy process and the system was only available from late autumn.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.An effect of industrial action in my Department's local offices last year was that this process was delayed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  The first payments for 2008 REPS 4 applications issued in the last week of January to those whose applications required no correction following the administrative checks.  Further payments continue to be made as applications are cleared.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1205	Under the Health Check agreement modulation funds of approximately €120m will be allocated to Ireland's Rural Development Programme over a four year period beginning in 2010.  This funding may only be spent on measures addressing the new and ongoing challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigation, renewable energies, water management, biodiversity, innovation measures relating to these areas and the restructuring of the dairy sector.Ireland's Rural Development Programme will be revised during 2009 to incorporate both the additional funding and the new measures.  I am currently considering how these funds can best be used to develop Irish agriculture within the terms laid down in the EU regulations.  As part of this process I have asked for submissions from the rural development stakeholders and the closing date for these submissions is 16 February 2009.  All submissions received will be examined carefully, and will be a useful input to the decisions on these matters, which I expect to announce in the near future.

Ireland's shell fish farmers produce between 45,000 to 50,000 metric tonnes of high quality mussels and oysters annually and new species of shell fish like abalone and scallops are also being farmed in increasing volumes.The considerable potential of the Irish aquaculture sector to create wealth and jobs in coastal communities has been recognised by the Government for some time.  The Seafood Strategy, Steering a New Course — Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013, identifies a much bigger role for aquaculture in meeting the increasing demand for seafood and sets down a number of recommendations that will deliver significant development and expansion of the aquaculture sector.

The timing of payment is subject to the provision of adequate funding on the Vote for my Department.  Last week, the Government took a number of decisions on the overall Expenditure Control and Economic Strategy that included the funding for the Farm Waste Management Scheme and arrangements for payment of grant aid under that scheme on a phased basis.  My Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on the implications for the Department's Vote and the details that will be published in the 2009 Revised Estimates Volume next month.I have arranged to meet the Irish Banks tomorrow to discuss with them how those farmers who are due their Farm Waste Management grants, which are guaranteed by the State, might be facilitated.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1209	The Estimate for my Department is prepared to provide for liabilities that are expected to arise in the year in question.  A substantial element of the funding in the Vote for my Department each year is provided for demand led schemes that are subject to variables such as farmer up-take and the rate at which approved projects are completed which in turn is influenced by market and economic conditions.  The nature of many schemes and the potential liability is that there is always a degree of uncertainty about the final outturn.  The situation in relation to 2009 was complicated further by the fact that the Budget was presented by the Minister for Finance in the context of very careful consideration by Government of the allocation of scarce resources in the context of the national economic and fiscal situation.Against this background, a particular difficulty has arisen in relation to the funding for the Farm Waste Management Scheme in 2009.  In addition to the general situation I have outlined, other factors which had an influence on the preparation of the 2009 Estimate were the closing date for the scheme, the adverse weather conditions which impeded construction work, the credit shortage and deterioration in market conditions as well as the fact that the Government provided a Supplementary Estimate of €195 million for the Scheme prior to the Budget in order to meet liabilities arising under the Scheme.  In these circumstances, €125 million was provided for the Scheme in the 2009 Budget.  In the above context and given that a large number of claims were submitted before the expiry of the deadline for the completion of work, including over 14,000 claims in December, this funding is inadequate to meet the claims on hands.Last week, the Government took a number of decisions on the overall Expenditure Control and Economic Strategy that included the funding for the Farm Waste Management Scheme and arrangements for payment of grant aid on a phased basis.  My Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on the implications for the Department's Vote and the details that will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume next month.

Foreshore consents for offshore wind developments already granted from 2002 to date allow for the installation of at least 1512 megawatt (MW) of offshore wind capacity.  In addition possible Foreshore consents for offshore wind projects currently at both the application and the pre-application stage have the potential to deliver an additional 1900 MW.A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has been under consideration for some time.  This is intended to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State's foreshore estate in the future.  Preparation of these proposals will to take account, among other things, of the EU Public Participation Directive, the principles in the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green Paper, the EU Marine Strategy Directive and the EU Roadmap on Maritime Spatial Planning.The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for certain foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 including in respect of all energy related developments would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.In the interest of efficiency and effectiveness it is considered appropriate that the review of the Foreshore Acts should await the completion of the transfer of the relevant elements of the Foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative and management framework.

By and large these targets were met.In mid-2008, there was a surge in the number of claims received in Redundancy Payments, such that by the end of the year there had been an increase of 59.9% over 2007.  At that time, customer service targets had slipped as staff were unable to cope with such a massive increase in claim numbers.  Actual targets being achieved were, in order of priority: 6-8+ weeks for statutory lump sum payments to employees whose employers had failed to pay the statutory entitlement; 12+ weeks for correctly submitted online claims, hard copy printed down correctly signed and sent in by employer; 16+ for manual claims sent in by employers.I have allocated additional new staff to the Redundancy Payments Section in recent weeks and work has commenced on clearing the backlog, while pressing ahead with the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums to those employees whose employers have failed to pay their entitlements. However, the number of claims continues to rise.Revised customer service targets are currently being established and the staffing level within the section is being closely monitored with a view to ensuring that claimants get the best possible service at, what is for them, a very difficult time.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1215	Since 2004, Irish labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the European Union.  For strategic skills/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced under the Employment Permits Act, 2006.Currently employment permit holders constitute approximately 1.5% of the total labour force.  Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the numbers of permit applications and consequent numbers of permits issued over the last six months have been showing a consistent downward trend.I am currently having our employment permit arrangements reviewed to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1217	I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the five members of the board who resigned on 19 January 2009.Ms Anne Heraty is a non-executive director in Bord na Móna, is also a board member of Forfás and is the Chairperson of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  Mr. Gary McGann is the Chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority.To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Michael Jacob, Mr. Ned Sullivan and Ms Noel Harweth do not currently sit on State boards.Appointments to the board of a State Body are generally made by the Minister with responsibility for the Body in question, usually subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The arrangements for such appointments are normally set out in legislation establishing the State Body.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1218	I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 169 together.I should firstly point out that, in relation to the evaluation and selection of projects, the SEUPB is bound to follow the structures and processes set out in the Operational Programme, as approved by the European Commission, which provides 75% funding for the entire INTERREG IVA Programme.  In this regard, individual project applications are a matter for the relevant Project Steering Committees of the INTERREG IVA Programme.  The SEUPB has a role on such Steering Committees, through the Joint Technical Secretariat, which chairs the meetings and which provides relevant project assessments.  The Deputy will be aware that the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) has no direct function in relation to the assessment of individual project applications.The Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) is the Managing Authority for the Peace III and INTERREG IVA EU-funded cross-border Programmes.  The INTERREG IVA Programme 2007-2013 has allocated indicative budgets to various themes, whose eligible area comprises of Northern Ireland, the Southern border counties and western Scotland.  This includes a Tourism theme, which has an allocation of €30 million, and a Rural Development theme, which has an allocation of €10 million.  I understand that, while the Tourism theme is currently closed for applications and most of its budget has already been committed in principle, the Rural Development theme will be open for applications later in the year and that this may offer an opportunity for funding of the type mentioned by the Deputies.  I understand that the Body is open to discuss the application process with any eligible applicant or anyone acting on their behalf.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1219	It is intended that the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009 will be published in mid-March this year.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1220	I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 175 together.I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax will come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009.  A general rate of €10 per passenger will apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009.  However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300 km or less from Dublin airport.  This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate.  We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel.  A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK, France and the Netherlands, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should not have much of an effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period has, in addition to weak world economic activity, been largely driven by a massive spike in oil prices.  Oil prices have now halved from the all-time high prices experienced earlier in the year.I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it is a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.  I have no plans to review the air travel tax.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1221	I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.The new public service pension related deduction will apply to the remuneration received by a public service employee at the rates announced on 3 February 2009.Public Servants paying the new pension contribution will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as those making pension contributions in the private sector.  Contributions will be deducted from gross pay by employers before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated.  Thus, pension contributions will be effectively relieved of tax at the marginal rate.The income levy on the other hand is payable on gross pay, before account is taken of pension contributions or capital allowances.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1222	The pension related deduction announced on 3 February 2009 will realise a payroll saving of €1.35 billion in a full-year and €1.12 billion in 2009.  The deduction will apply to all remuneration.  Certain income that is not pensionable, for example, overtime earnings, will be subject to the deduction.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1223	Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2004 shows the allocation of National Lottery funding to subheads in the Votes of Government Departments for 2004.  A similar breakdown of expenditure which was part-funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery is given in Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for Public Services for each of the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (copies of these appendices are set out below).Since 2005, subheads which had previously been funded completely by the proceeds of the National Lottery are now partly funded by such proceeds.  As the Lottery funds are treated as an item of non-tax revenue, it is not possible to indicate the percentage of Lottery funding contained in any individual subhead.  The National Lottery contribution to the funding of all subheads part-funded from the Lottery in the years 2005 to 2008 is as follows:Year€m2005210.52006200.02007230.02008265.0Vote/Subhead2003 Provisional Outturn

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1225	As the Deputy is aware, Telecom Éireann was floated on the Stock Exchange as a private limited company in July 1999 and renamed Eircom. It is now in the private sector and employees are employees of Eircom, although staff from the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs may retain certain limited terms and conditions of employment under the Postal and Telecommunication Services Act 1983 and the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act 1999 that derive from their previous employment in that Department.

Accordingly, normal commercial decisions, which include decisions on corporate sponsorship, are a matter for the Board of Anglo.Notwithstanding this I am informed that Anglo is not sponsoring the Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham this year, nor will there be any corporate sponsorship.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1227	I am assuming that the "scheme" referred to in the Deputy's question is the scheme of tax relief for donations to eligible charities and other approved bodies under section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.The position is that all primary and post primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of this scheme.The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a person who is subject to self-assessment or a company.  For a PAYE donor, the relief is given on a "grossed up" basis to the eligible charity or approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor.  The claim for refunds is made by the eligible charity or approved body.  In the case of a self-assessed donor, that individual claims the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement.  In the case of a company, it will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, because of the different arrangements for claiming the relief it is not possible to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy.  However, the following table sets out the refunds of tax made by Revenue to primary and post primary schools relating to qualifying donations made — by individual PAYE donors only — in 2006, 2007 and 2008:YearNumber of SchoolsDonations by PAYE DonorsTax Refunds Made€m€m2006912.701.6520071223.041.9620081453.241.99

As this guidance is freely available no documentation has been specifically issued to public bodies regarding pre-qualification criteria to be used by them.The application of turnover limits is a matter for individual contracting authorities to determine.  Under EU law, the rules require that such limits must be proportionate to the size, complexity and nature of the relevant project, and they must also be transparent and non-discriminatory.  Appropriate turnover levels should be set to enable contracting authorities establish a sufficient number of competent contractors who have the capacity to carry out the work to be included on a tender list.Under EU law contracting authorities are obliged on request to inform unsuccessful tenderers of decisions reached in relation to these tenders.  However, where firms are dissatisfied with the administration of public procurement procedures by contracting authorities, they can have recourse to the Irish courts or can register a complaint with the EU Commission.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1231	The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professionals, including physiotherapists.  This new system of statutory registration will apply to the 12 professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed and is the first time that fitness to practise procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis.  The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system by regulation over time, as appropriate.The first step in the implementation of the system was the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, launched in March 2007.  The Council has now recruited a Chief Executive Officer in May of last year and is currently putting in place a suitable organisational structure.  The Council has examined which professions from within the designated 12 are most suitable for early registration and has decided to appoint the first two of 12 statutory Registration Boards, provided for under the Act.  The Social Workers Registration Board and the Physiotherapists Registration Board are the first two registration boards prioritised for registration initially, to be completed by early 2009.The Health and Social Care Professionals Act, 2005 provides for the protection of the title ‘physiotherapist' for use by those professionals who will qualify for registration with the Physiotherapists Registration Board.  There is an additional issue for consideration regarding the possible protection of the title ‘physical therapist' via regulation for use by those professionals who will be registered with the Physiotherapists' Registration Board.  This issue will be considered by the Health and Social Care Professionals Council during the course of establishing the Physiotherapist Registration Board. In line with the provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, the Minister will consult with the Physiotherapists Registration Board and other appropriate organisations in regard to the protection of variant titles under the Act.

No. 41 of 2009) and the Public Health (Tobacco) (Self Service Vending Machines) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 42 of 2009) were finalised last week and will be available on my Department's website this week.  The Public Health (Tobacco) (Retail Signs) Regulations 2009 provide for the sign to be displayed at a premises where tobacco products are sold by retail are currently being finalised and will be available shortly.  The draft Public Health (Tobacco) (Product Information) Regulations 2008 were required to be notified to the European Commission and cannot be finalised before 24 March.  However I can provide the Deputy with a copy of the draft regulation if required.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1234	Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over ceased on 31 December 2008, and with effect from 1 January 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.Under the over 70s medical card scheme, from 1 January 2009 any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single)/€72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.  The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate, based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive's (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate on a quarterly basis.Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of "longer term" investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures.Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented and only the net rental income will be included as income.  The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the rental of the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance etc.The above information relating to the assessment of savings and investments under the over 70s medical card scheme is available on my Department's website at www.dohc.ie and I have also asked the HSE to ensure that it is available on its website (www.hse.ie).  Persons can also contact their local HSE office or the HSE "infoline" at 1850-24-1850 for further information.  The HSE has also prepared detailed assessment guidelines for staff in relation to the over 70s medical card scheme.

Following a decision to site regional units in Cork and Galway, the Board engaged with the former Southern Health Board (SHB).  On the advice of the Chief Executive Officer of the SHB, the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital was selected as the host hospital for the Southern Screening Unit.  I understand that this advice was the result of consultations within the SHB.The capital costs associated with the establishment of the Southern Unit totalled €10,287,000, comprising:€Construction5,718,000Imaging and other equipment2,634,000Mobile Units1,935,000Screening commenced at the Unit on 4 December 2007.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1240	As the overall operation and capacity of beds in long stay homes and hospitals for the elderly is a service matter, this has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.The following is a revised reply to Question No. 191 received from the Department of Health and Children.The Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2009 sets out the HSE's plan for the management and configuration of public long-term residential care services during 2009.  The plan identifies a requirement to reduce the number of long-term residential care beds in some parts of the country, particularly where the standard of facilites is considered inadequate and where it is necessary to address infrastructural deficits in order to meet Health & Safety and Fire Requirements and the planned new standards.  The full details in relation to these planned reductions are not currently available.  However, my Department has sought urgent briefing from the Health Service Executive in relation to this matter and I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible with a comprehensive response.As part of the HSE's plan, it will also provide for a number of additional and replacement long-term residential care beds over the course of 2009.  The latest information from the HSE indicates that 704 additional beds and 492 replacement beds will become operational during 2009. This includes beds being provided under the Capital Plan and beds being provided under the Fast-Track Initiative.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1241	The provision of services for older people is a priority for Government.  A commitment has been made to provide 860 additional public long-stay beds for older people under the Fast-Track Initiative and these are in the process of being put in place.  Older people have also been specifically highlighted in the Social Inclusion Priority of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.The latest information from the HSE indicates that 704 additional beds and 492 replacement beds will become operational during 2009.  This includes beds being provided under the Capital Plan and beds being provided under the Fast-Track Initiative.In terms of the number of beds currently under construction, I have asked the HSE to provide detailed information directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1242	The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.Since the commencement of the scheme almost 35,000 applications have been received by the Scheme Administrator.  Over 33,000 of these applications have been concluded which has resulted in excess of 19,500 offers being made to date.  Payments have issued to over 16,000 claimants with a value totalling in excess of €353m.  In the region of 1,600 applications remain to be determined.  The vast majority of the remaining offers will issue by the end of April 2009.  The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  Two Appeals Officers have been appointed to consider appeals.  Up to 30 January 2009 the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office had received 5,220 appeals, of which 1,385 relate to appeals made against amount offers to claimants.  The Appeals Office has issued 2,806 appeal decisions and of these appeal decisions, 184 decisions have resulted in an increased offer to claimants and 242 decisions have resulted in an initial offer to claimants.  The total cost of administering the Scheme to the end of January 2009 was €21m which includes payments made to the Scheme Administrator, HSE administrative costs, Appeals Office costs, legal fees and probate costs.

This unit is the last remaining ward on an upper floor of the hospital.  Due to these fire and safety issues it is not viable to continue to accommodate patients in this area of the hospital nor is it viable to refurbish the ward to meet required standards.  However, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	Last July, I announced that further provisions of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 and 2004 are to be commenced from 1 July 2009.  From that date there will be no advertising or display of tobacco products in retail outlets and tobacco products must be stored in a closed container.  There will be tighter controls on the operation of vending machines and anyone wishing to sell tobacco products must register with the Office of Tobacco Control.  The implementation of these important measures, which are aimed at protecting both children and adults from the dangers of tobacco consumption, are my key tobacco control priorities for 2009.The harmful effects of exposure to cigarette smoke are well known as is the fact that such exposure is particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces (including motor cars).  Parents and others with responsibility for the welfare of children have a particular responsibility to ensure that such exposure does not take place.  The issue of introducing a ban on smoking in cars in which children under 16 years of age are being transported, will be kept under review.

In the case of a non-national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen, those conditions are that the applicant must — be of full age, be of good character, be married to the Irish citizen for a period of not less than three years, be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting, be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse, have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years, intend in good faith to continue to reside in the island of Ireland after naturalisation, have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.It is open to the person concerned to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation with my Department if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.

This represents an increase of 13 members, or 7% in the period in question. While the number of Gardaí attached to the Community Policing Unit in Blanchardstown Garda Station on 31 December 2008 was 24, all Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as and when they arise.  As with any organisation, on any given day, the strength of Blanchardstown Garda Station may fluctuate due, for example, to retirements, resignations etc.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Blanchardstown Garda Station will be fully considered within the overall context of policing requirements throughout the country.

It should not be assumed from the figures provided that this decentralisation project will ultimately be undersubscribed. The filling of the remaining posts will essentially only arise when the permanent accommodation is in place, at which time a trawl of those applicants on the Central Applications Facility who originally listed the Property Registration Authority in Roscommon as a 2 to 10 preference will be carried out. New applicants for Roscommon, first preference or otherwise, since September 2004 will also be taken into account at that stage.Planning permission has been granted for the new permanent offices in Roscommon for the Property Registration Authority. The Office of Public Works, who are responsible for providing the accommodation, are liaising with the successful tenderer in relation to the preparation of working drawings. It is anticipated that the permanent accommodation will be available for occupation around mid-2010.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 June 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

It should also be borne in mind that the vast majority of outstanding penal and bench warrants relate to unpaid fines for minor infractions of the law and not convictions arising from violent crime. I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána give priority to the execution of warrants against those that they believe to be involved in serious crime.I am further informed that  the Garda authorities are committed to strengthening the warrants enforcement process. The issue of the execution of warrants, and bench warrants in particular, has been raised by the Garda Commissioner with each Regional Assistant Commissioner and a range of measures, aimed at reducing the number of warrants on hand, have been identified and are being implemented. These measures include the re-assignment of additional Gardaí to this function and the appointment of Inspectors with responsibility for execution of outstanding warrants. The position is being closely monitored by senior Garda management and consideration will be given, at an organisational level, to introducing further measures to address the issue if necessary.In addition, I intend to seek Government approval for a Fines Bill which will provide for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  As so many warrants relate to financial penalties, these proposals should result in a smaller number of warrants being issued and so reduce pressure on the system.  I am also looking at other legislative measures in this area.I can assure the Deputy that the operation of the warrants system will continue to be monitored, particularly with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.Warrant TypeNumber outstandingBench warrant534Penal warrant3,306Committal warrant142*Figures are operational and liable to change.

The approach has had three core objectives; a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term working visas (known as E3s); and a solution for our undocumented.The second objective, the provision of long term working visas similar to the E3 Visas available to Australian citizens, has already formed the basis for detailed discussions with senior Member of Congress over the past twelve months. Ideally, the undocumented would be able to avail of the proposed visa scheme. However, if that is not possible — as many of our key contacts have already advised — then their best prospect for a solution lies with comprehensive immigration reform.The Deputy will wish to note that the E3 visa scheme for Australian citizens, put in place in 2005 as a result of a free-trade agreement between the US and Australia, is targeted at highly skilled graduates and is not open to undocumented Australians. If an identical scheme were to be introduced for Ireland, it would be of little benefit to our undocumented citizens.Finding a solution for the undocumented will remain an important priority for the Government. In taking up the issue with the new US Administration and Congress, we are building on the extensive work on behalf of the undocumented that the Government has carried out over recent years with many of those now within the Administration, and in cooperation with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, to which we have provided funding of $235,000 since 2006.The Taoiseach, I and other members of Government will use the unique opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US to engage the new Administration at the very highest level on this issue.

Proposals are appraised by Irish Aid staff using a number of different criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources.The Irish Aid strategic and annual business planning processes have a strong results focus which identifies specific results against which Irish Aid programmes are measured and evaluated. Programmes are continually monitored and assessed by both staff in the field and at headquarters to ensure that they are achieving results and that intended objectives and goals are being accomplished. External reviews are also conducted as necessary.Irish Aid expenditure is subject to rigorous accounting, evaluation and audit controls. Programmes are regularly audited and evaluated by independent audit firms and by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Unit's work is also examined by my Department's independent Audit Committee. These evaluations provide assurance that funds are used for the purposes intended and have a particular focus on poverty outcomes and value for money.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1269	Ireland and the United States enjoy close political, economic and cultural relations. Successive Presidents and their Administrations, and Ireland's many friends on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle, have made an enormous contribution to bringing peace and economic prosperity to this island. We enjoy in particular an excellent working relationship with the bi-partisan Friends of Ireland in Congress, chaired by Congressman Richie Neal, who continue to provide invaluable assistance and support to us on many issues.The Government attaches the highest importance to strengthening and developing this unique relationship, including through the work of the Irish Embassy in Washington. The close cooperation between our two countries is underpinned by the network of relations with Members of Congress and their staff maintained by the Embassy and our Consulates in the United States. The Ambassador and his colleagues attach the greatest priority to their work in this area and coordinate closely with their counterparts in Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and other State agencies.We are also fortunate to benefit from the experience and expertise of the members of the Taoiseach's Economic Advisory Group which was established in 1992 to engage corporate leaders in America to promote Ireland as an investment location and to respond to Irish American leaders' willingness to be identified with Irish issues. The Group has been a source of invaluable counsel and advice over the years, and the Government is extremely grateful for the significant contribution made by its distinguished members.Reflecting the constantly changing character of the relationship, the Taoiseach last July initiated a review of Ireland/US relations with a view to ensuring that these are developed in the optimal manner. That work is well advanced and the Government will be considering the outcome of the review in the coming weeks.

Since 1998, over €725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.  As I announced in the House recently no decision has been taken about the timing of future rounds of the Programme.Under the Programme, the level of funding to each county, including Tipperary, for local projects is on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of the available funding on the basis of the population as set out in the 2006 census of population conducted by the Central Statistics Office, subject to the number, nature and quality of applications received for each county. The level of allocations therefore to successful local applicants in each county in recent years was primarily determined by the overall level of allocations available under the Programme in those years for local clubs and the population of the county.

Under the law as it stands at present, CCÉ, as a voluntary non-profit organisation which is not a limited company, is not covered by the requirements of the Companies Act 1963, as amended, to publish accounts.   The Deputy will be aware that the Charities Bill, which it is anticipated will be enacted in the current parliamentary session, provides that any organisation eligible for charitable tax exemptions on the day the relevant provisions of the legislation are commenced will be automatically deemed to be entered onto a proposed new Register of Charities. All charities on the Register will be required to submit an annual activity report to the proposed new Charities Regulatory Authority. All charities will also be required to keep proper books of accounts and the vast majority of charities will be required to submit an annual statement of accounts to the new Authority. Both the annual activity report and the annual statement of accounts submitted by charities will be accessible by the public on the Register via the internet, which will greatly enhance transparency and accountability across the charities sector.With regard to the public funding provided to CCÉ, the position is that the organisation is required to submit an annual business plan to my Department, as well as audited accounts. These are assessed each year in the context of the decision-making process in relation to the grant assistance for current purposes to be provided in the forthcoming year. I understand that appropriate assessment processes are also applied by the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism in relation to the capital funding provided by that Department.    In addition, my Department has commissioned an independent review of the funding to CCÉ with a view to providing assurances from an audit and accountability point of view that the organisation's Regional Development Programme is being implemented appropriately and effectively; that public funds are being used appropriately and subject to adequate controls; and that there is adherence to normal requirements in relation to tax compliance, recruitment and procurement. The review will be finalised shortly.

The offices listed in the questions, with the exception of Cobh, are Branch Offices.Unlike Social Welfare Local Offices that are staffed by civil servants, Branch Offices are operated by private individuals under a contract for service.  Branch managers, under their contract for service, must provide for sufficient clerical assistance to allow for the efficient performance of the work of the office. However, the decisions on branch office claims are made in the parent Local Office.Decisions for Mallow and Fermoy Branch Offices are made in Mallow Control Office which also decides claims for Macroom Branch Office. Decisions for Midleton and Youghal Branch Offices are made in Carrigaline Local Office which also decides claims for the Carrigaline area and for Bandon, Clonakilty and Kinsale Branch Offices.  Following a recent staffing review four additional staff are being assigned to Carrigaline Local Office but due to the limited accommodation in the Carrigaline office these staff are being based in the Regional Office in the Marina in Cork city.The overall performance in any individual local office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office.The Department has put a range of measures in place to deal with the extra workload arising from the increase in the Live Register.  These include:additional posts assigned;use of temporary staff to fill vacancies pending the appointment of permanent staff;extension of temporary staff contracts in certain offices;increased overtime;prioritisation of work;process improvement initiatives.These measures are being reviewed on a continuous basis.Average time to decide (weeks) January 2009OfficeJobseekers BenefitJobseekers AllowanceClaims Awaiting decisionAverage weeks to decisionClaims Awaiting decisionAverage weeks to decisionMallow3025.541806.60Cobh130.98242.47Fermoy1983.691445.45Midleton3474.392678.87Youghal942.671516.72

My Department does not hold information on waiting lists.However, a statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing Act 1988. The most recent assessment of need took place in 2008, information on which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie, including a breakdown of the net need figure by housing authority. Also available on the Department’s website are details of allocations for Kildare County Council and Athy Town Council for the years up to 2008.With regard to allocations for 2009, my Department is due to meet the housing authorities in March as part of the annual Housing Action Plan review process. Following this, 2009 allocations for the social housing investment programme will be finalised and I expect to be in a position to announce these allocations in early April.  Newbridge Town Council is not a housing authority and so does not receive an allocation for social housing.

Under section 13 of the Act, a person employed by a local authority who is not the holder of an employment designated by order under section 161 is disqualified from being elected or co-opted to, or from becoming a member of, a local authority.The employments designated under section 161 of the Act are those employments whose maximum salary, on the last date for receipt of nominations at a local election, does not exceed the maximum salary of a Clerical Officer in the local authority service. Therefore, employees whose maximum salary is above that of a Clerical Officer may not stand at a local election.

Section 13 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act confers powers on an authorised person to, inter alia, enter premises, take samples and inspect documents.  Section 296 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 relates to the powers of an authorised person in the context of protecting salmonid fisheries.Primary responsibility for the protection of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and section 28 of the 1977 Act, confers powers on an authorised person, including powers of entry and inspection.  Local authorities operate under the general supervision of the EPA regarding the performance of their functions in relation to environmental protection.A number of additional powers are to be given to local authorities under the proposed revisions to the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations and these proposed revisions also provide for enhanced cooperation between local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this area.

The draft Guidelines are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk assessment and management in the planning system. The draft guidelines state that: development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly flood plains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level; a sequential approach must be adopted to flood risk management when assessing the location of new development based on avoidance, reduction and mitigation of flood risk; flood risk assessment must be incorporated into the process of making decisions on planning applications and planning appeals.A total of 39 submissions were received on foot of the consultation process and these are currently being considered by my Department, in conjunction with the OPW, with a view to finalising the guidelines shortly.

My Department was advised by the Marine Institute that the results of a chemical analysis of samples from the proposed area to be dredged showed high levels of contamination, principally from Copper and Zinc, and that the material was not suitable for direct disposal at sea.The Marine Institute has held direct discussions with the consultant engineers acting for Arklow Harbour Commissioners with a view to arriving at a possible solution to the current difficulties.  However, the Marine Institute has advised my Department that it continues to have concerns regarding the disposal of contaminated spoil arising from dredging at Arklow Harbour.At a meeting held on 19 June 2008 between the Harbour Commissioners, the Marine Institute and an official of my Department, the Commissioners agreed to re-examine the proposal to dredge the harbour having regard to the issues raised in relation to the contaminated sediment.  This examination will include consideration of appropriate alternative dredging and disposal methods in order to ensure safe disposal of the dredged material.  When that examination has been completed, my Department, in conjunction with its specialist advisors, will assess any revised proposal submitted in relation to dredging of the harbour.It is not possible to say at this stage what the eventual outcome of this application will be and the need to consider disposal options other than by Dumping at Sea cannot be ruled out.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1286	This Government remains committed to the maintenance of an active and substantial forestry programme, evidenced by the almost €125 million that has been allocated to the forestry subhead for 2009.  Over €100 million of this allocation has been assigned to the afforestation programme, which is in line with the financial commitment given to forestry in 2008.There have been no reductions in either the levels of establishment grants or annual premiums payable under the Afforestation Scheme for 2009.  The Scheme is fully operational and my officials are accepting and processing both applications for approval to plant and applications for the appropriate grant payments.  I am satisfied that afforestation remains an attractive land use alternative for landowners given the grant and premium payments currently in place.Indeed, the current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes is the most financially attractive package made available in the history of forestry in Ireland.  The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years.  Under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS), landowners can receive a premium of up to €200 per hectare, over and above their forestry premium, should they choose to participate in the scheme, which promotes the establishment of high nature value forestry.The Forest Service of my Department remains dedicated to the task of promoting and supporting a robust afforestation programme in order, among other things, to utilize the carbon benefits of Irish forests.  Irish forests planted since 1990 sequestered 1.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2008.  It is estimated that this will increase to between 4.1 and 5.0 million tonnes by 2030, depending on the rate of afforestation.  The Government remains committed to working towards the achievement of this target.

These Regulations are applicable to the fishing fleets of all Member States fishing with specified fishing gears in the relevant sea areas.  Under these Regulations, Ireland and other relevant Member States are required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage its allocation of fishing effort-days at sea limits in areas VIa (north west of Ireland) and VIIa (the Irish Sea) for vessels using specified gear types.At the December Council, the EU Commission's proposals for complete closure of all whitefish fisheries in the waters off Donegal were successfully renegotiated and agreement was reached on a package of measures which both delivers strong conservation measures for the cod, whiting and haddock stocks in decline while facilitating the continuation of important fishing activities for the Irish fleet in the area.Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, the Department introduced a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort for the period 1 February 2009 to 30 April 2009.I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the  Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am happy to make amendments where proposed by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) within the legal framework that has been established.

When considering applications under the Foreshore Acts, including offshore energy projects, the role of my Department is to ensure the protection of the environment and the sustainability of developments on the foreshore.  Applications for offshore electricity generating stations are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment and the views are sought from in excess of 100 consultees, both statutory and non statutory.Applications are subject to a two month public consultation phase, advertised both locally and nationally.  The application is assessed within the Department and by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, which comprises of a number of professionals, suitably qualified to assess the application.  When it has been determined that all the issues in the consultation process have been properly addressed, the application is sent to the Minister for a decision as to whether the lease should be granted.A consolidation and streamlining of the Foreshore Acts has been under consideration for some time.  This is intended to provide a modern, effective and integrated legal framework for the management of the State's foreshore estate in the future.  Preparation of these proposals will take account, among other things, of the EU Public Participation Directive, the principles in the EU Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management, the outcome of the EU Maritime Green Paper, the EU Marine Strategy Directive and the EU Roadmap on Maritime Spatial Planning.The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for certain foreshore licensing functions under the Foreshore Act 1933 including in respect of all energy related developments would transfer to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.In the interest of efficiency and effectiveness it is considered appropriate that the review of the Foreshore Acts should await the completion of the transfer of the relevant elements of the Foreshore functions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to develop the appropriate coastal zone legislative and management framework.  In the meantime legislation will be brought forward very shortly to give effect to the transfer of the relevant functions to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1300	The current position in regard to the WTO negotiations is that talks are stalled following the failure to reach agreement at the Ministerial meeting last July and the decision to defer indefinitely a second Ministerial meeting planned for last December.  The World Economic Forum at Davos last month provided no new momentum for the negotiations and the next key event will be the G20 meeting in London in April.All in all the prospects for agreement are uncertain and therefore it is premature to forecast the expected impact on Irish and European food producers.  On the one hand, the new administration in the US, upcoming elections in India, changes in EU Commissioners and the changed economic situation militate against agreement being reached.  On the other hand there is the determination of the WTO DG Lamy and a number of WTO members to reach agreement.  On balance, it is difficult to see serious negotiations restarting until later this year and any conclusion in 2009.Against that background I, my officials and my colleagues in Government continue to pursue Ireland's interests in the negotiations with the Commission and other Member States at every opportunity at coordination meetings in Geneva, at the Article 133 Committee in Brussels and at the recent meeting of Trade Ministers.  We want an agreement that is balanced within and between the various negotiating pillars, that delivers real benefits to Ireland and that does not sacrifice our agriculture sector.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1301	The Government fully supports the EU commitments to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, and to scale up this reduction to as much as 30%, as part of a new global climate change agreement when other developed countries make comparable efforts. The Government also supports the commitment to increase the share of renewables in energy use to 20% by 2020, including a 10% biofuel target.While it is recognised, both nationally and at EU level, that delivering emissions reductions in the agriculture sector will be difficult, it is also clear that any policy leading to a significant reduction in Irish cattle numbers, as a means of achieving emissions reductions, would be simply counter-productive in terms of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  Any fall in Irish beef and dairy output would simply be replaced on European and global markets, most likely, by food from countries where production systems are far less sustainable and where the carbon footprint of that food is significantly higher than food produced in Ireland.Ireland's pasture based food production system is very efficient in terms of emissions per unit of food produced and offers the optimal means of safe, sustainable, high-quality food production.Globally, the consumption of meat and dairy products is expected to increase significantly by 2050.  In the interests both of global food security and of the pursuit of important market opportunities, the ability of the EU agriculture and food sector to respond to these developments needs to be encouraged and protected.  In that context, I will continue to press for the policy strategies needed to ensure that we meet our climate change goals in ways that are consistent with national objectives for our agricultural sector and rural economy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1302	Bord Bia closely monitors food exports and has recently published a Strategy to boost food exports for the period 2009-2011.  The strategy sets out the Bord's six key priorities to be addressed including enhancing the industry's position on its home market to capitalise on the potential for growth and expansion of exports with a particular emphasis on the Eurozone markets.My Department in conjunction with the industry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia continues to pursue the opening up of markets.  A Meat Market Group was established in 2007 to ensure market for Irish meat to non-EU markets.  The main barrier had been the restrictions imposed by countries as a result of BSE and efforts to remove remaining restrictions has met with considerable success.  The Saudi Arabian and South African markets were re-opened in 2007 while, more recently, the Philippines and Israel have lifted their restrictions.  Efforts are continuing to regain access to other markets such as Japan, which continues to restrict for BSE related reasons, and Russia, whose restrictions are related to the recent dioxin incident.Building on the ongoing work of the Meat Market Access group an inter-Departmental Group chaired by my Department and comprised of representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara has also been established and is currently engaged in a coordinated effort to identify potential market opportunities for the full range of Irish food and beverages, prioritisation of market initiatives and broader access issues.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1303	My Department is responsible for the operation of EU controls on imports of products of animal origin and fresh fruit and vegetables under its service contract with the FSAI and in compliance with Community rules for the hygiene of food and feed.The EU rules stipulate that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.In the case of importation from third countries products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment (with the exception of honey), be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation.  Consignments from third countries must be landed at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) for veterinary checks.  In co-operation with Customs services my Department undertakes a range of checks on imported consignments including documentary, identity and physical including the sampling of imported products for analysis under national residue monitoring programmes and EU safeguard measures.The scope of products of animal origin coming under these requirements are set out under Commission Decision No. 2007/275/EC11 Official Journal of the European Communities No. L116 of 4.5.2007 which also provides for an exemption from border inspection in the case of certain composite and specified food products comprising processed low risk processed animal products and plant products.  Details of the products are set out in the Decision.  Such products must comply with public health requirements for their placing on to the market.  Consignments of animal products must remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU.Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.  Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.  Where there are risks to animal and public health, and in cases of animal disease outbreaks, the Community adopts safeguard measures that ban or restrict imports from affected countries or areas until the risks have been removed.The FVO monitors and inspects each Member State's controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.Imported fruit and vegetables are checked for compliance with EU marketing standards.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  There are currently 36 specific marketing standards.  Regulation (EC) No 1221/2008 will, with effect from 1 July 2009, reduce the number of specific standards to ten but all fruit and vegetables will be required to satisfy the EU's general marketing standard.  Controls on the import of food of non-animal origin comes under the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1304	Responsibility for the development of the sport horse industry rests mainly with Horse Sport Ireland, an organization established in 2007 in accordance with the proposals outlined in the Dowling Report (July 2006).  Horse Sport Ireland, working with its affiliate organizations, is putting in place policies, practices and plans that will lead to the sustainable development of a vibrant sport horse sector in this country.  It aims to lead the Irish Sport Horse sector to achieve and maintain world class standards in the areas of breeding, sport, and the provision of leisure riding opportunities.  I believe this will strengthen the sport horse sector, bringing a new common purpose to future development and will lead to greater organizational efficiencies within the sport horse sector resulting in an enhancement of Ireland's standing in the sport.In co-operation with Horse Sport Ireland my Department provides a range of horse breeding improvement grants from NDP funds, which are focused on quality, to encourage farmers to breed marketable non-thoroughbreds such as Irish Draughts, Irish Sport Horses, Piebald and Skewbald Horses, Kerry Bog, Connemara and other ponies.  Funds have also been provided for the marketing and promotion of such horses and for the development of the sport horse sector.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1305	Since taking up the Agriculture Fisheries and Food portfolio in June 2008, it has been highlighted to me very forcefully by the Federation of Irish Fishermen that it is essential to have in place a level playing field on control across the EU.The EU Commission estimates that 88% of EU stocks are over-exploited and scientists have recommended closure of 19% of fisheries.  These are shocking statistics and should make us all pause and take stock of the serious situation facing the industry across Europe.  Each December we agree the TACs and quotas for the following year taking account of the scientific advice available, but where we are failing, I believe, is that these limits are not being respected and there is persistent overfishing well in excess of quota across Member States.The EU Court of Auditors report in December 2007 highlighted this problem and identified substantial control failures across Member States.  On foot of the Court of Auditor findings, the Commission has brought forward a proposal to strengthen fisheries control across the EU.  The Commission's proposals for a new control system are aimed at tackling overfishing.  The main themes of their new approach follow.There should be a new common approach to control and inspection.  This involves a strong focus on inspections on shore based links in the supply chain whereby the owner of the fish must be able to produce documents proving that the product was caught in conformity with the rules and that it observes a principle of product traceability.  It involves using best practices such as risk analysis, concentrating control on problematical fisheries and periods.  It also involves the use of new technologies to ensure the maximum effective delivery.There should be promotion of a culture of compliance with the rules.  This involves a proposal for dissuasive and harmonised sanctions whereby a list of infringements is established together with a minimum fine applicable in all Member States.  It also involves a points based system which may lead to the suspension of a fishing licence or its permanent withdrawal.There should be promotion of enhanced co-operation between Member States involving systematic exchange of information involving a common website where all relevant information and control data is available to the control authorities of all Member States, the Commission and the Community Fisheries control Agency.  The proposal also strengthens the Commission's powers to guarantee common implementation of the Regulations and to intervene in case of poor application of control measures on the ground.I am, in principle supportive of these measures.  I am convinced that if we do not have a common approach to fisheries control across the EU it is grossly unfair to fishermen and will result, despite all our best efforts in Ireland, in the further decline and eventual closure of the fisheries that our fleet rely upon for their economic survival.It is important to remember that I and my predecessors as Ministers for Fisheries pushed strongly for a level playing field on control.  As a coastal state with responsibility for protecting some of the richest fishing ground in the EU and with a fishing industry almost completely dependent on sustainable fish stocks in our own waters, it is of the highest priority that there are effective control regimes in place across all Member States.Our own industry here in Ireland strongly believe that they are on their own in being subject to controls, and that operators in some other countries are not detected or when they are, that  they face low penalties.  I consider that this new proposal offers the best opportunity to introduce a level playing field on control.I will be seeking certain amendments to the provisions where the provisions are excessive or impractical.  I will in particular be seeking strong powers for coastal Member States to effectively police waters under their control.  I firmly believe that we must seize this opportunity to put a stop to illegal fishing which will if left unchecked destroy fish stocks and the livelihoods of coastal communities around our coast dependent on fishing.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1306	According to the European Commission's latest statistics, the EU's overall trade in agricultural produce is fairly close to balance with its total trade of almost €153 billion in 2007, split between imports of €77.4 billion and exports of €75.1 billion. Broadly speaking, the EU is a net importer of raw products such as tropical products, certain fruit and vegetables and oils/oilseeds while it is a net exporter of more processed products such as food preparations and beverages. It currently has a surplus of dairy products, whilst trade in livestock and cereal products is in balance.European food security and agricultural production issues are dealt with through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is constantly evolving to meet the demands of increased globalisation and competitive EU and world commodity markets.  The 2003 reforms of the CAP, with the introduction of the decoupling of direct payments under the Single Payment Scheme, allowed farmers to respond to the demands of the market and effectively meet consumers' needs.Ireland is a very significant net food exporter and is self sufficient in terms of the majority of agricultural commodities.  Latest statistics from the CSO indicate that Ireland is 675% self sufficient in terms of beef and over 230% self sufficient in terms of meat production (beef/sheepmeat/pigmeat/poultry) in overall terms.  A similar situation exists for dairy products where Ireland produces significantly higher quantities of butter and cheese than is required domestically.

On the Irish market a series of promotional campaigns are planned.  These will commence this month and will focus on building awareness and loyalty to the Bord Bia Quality Mark.  These will underline the quality of Irish pigmeat and will communicate its origin.A customer reassurance programme will be carried out in export markets.  This that will entail continued direct Bord Bia contact with customers, placing key information about the Irish pigmeat industry in context and demonstrating the integrity of Irish health controls, a trade communications programme designed to position the capability of the Irish pigmeat sector and the safety and quality measures in place to influence key decision makers in the retail, foodservice and manufacturing sectors and a programme to maximise international market access for Irish pigmeat products.  This will involve communications activities designed to build confidence among national authorities and opinion formers in markets based around Ireland's health controls.On the issue of traceability, the current position is that traceability of pork at slaughter and after is on the basis of production batch.  The Department is in consultation with the EU about the possible potential to improve pork traceability so as to reduce the impact in the event of future recalls.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1308	Approximately 70% of Irish sheepmeat production is exported, mainly to the high-value EU market.  Traditionally, France has been the major export market for Irish lamb and in 2008 it accounted for more than 50% of Irish sheepmeat exports.  The French market, however, has been in decline due to a fall in consumption and demand.  Also, Irish sheepmeat is facing strong competition on the French market from the UK due to a weakened sterling and from New Zealand, which continues to build up its presence of chilled lamb on the EU market.  However, the effect of the decline in exports to France has been lessened by increased exports to other markets.  Exports to Sweden and Denmark have increased significantly in recent years.The number of new potential markets for Irish lamb is limited due to the relatively high cost of the meat and to cultural factors, as lamb is not widely eaten in many countries of Eastern Europe.  As a result, promotional efforts are being targeted at maintaining and developing existing markets, including the home market.  In relation to providing the customer with a quality assured product, the Bord Bia operated Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme, which was established in 2007, now has 7000 participants and it is hoped to increase that number this year.

Samples for testing for the scheduled diseases — dourine, glanders and equine piroplasmosis — are sent abroad by exporting agencies for testing.  This procedure is considered to be more economical than setting up tests for such scheduled diseases in the DAFF laboratories.  A number of private laboratories provide testing facilities for the equine industry also.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1310	A comprehensive array of laboratory tests are provided in the DAFF Laboratories to comply with regulatory requirements relating to testing of food and feed. Generally, turn-around times for test results comply with what has been agreed with the laboratory's customers.  When it is more cost-effective (eg due to the need for sophisticated laboratory facilities), samples have been submitted to appropriate laboratories abroad for testing.  Increasing the range and depth of testing carried out in the laboratory divisions is a continual aim of the laboratory service.Tests for dioxins in feed are currently being validated at the Department of Finance's Laboratory at Backweston and should be available in the near future.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1311	My plans for the development of the beef sector can be summarised as follows: advanced processing methods and product development; sophisticated and targeted marketing; efficient farm production with quality assurance; and better scientifically based animal breeding.Ireland produces over 0.5 million tonnes of beef annually, over 90% of which is exported. More than 50% of these exports go to the UK with some 40% going to high-value Continental EU markets.  This outcome has been achieved by the delivery of a high-quality, competitively-priced product together with effective marketing and promotion by both Bord Bia and the industry.  The value of Irish beef exports in 2008 was almost €1.69 billion, an increase of over 7% on the previous year.The immediate prospects for Irish beef exports remain positive.  A continuing supply deficit in the EU market is predicted as production will only account for 90% to 95% of consumption.  This shortfall offers Irish beef producers an opportunity to further consolidate their position in this market.  Potential importers such as Brazil and Argentina are limited in what they can do because of either health or export restrictions.  However, the impact of exchange rate developments will be important, particularly in relation to the UK and, given the economic recession, a continuing switch to lower value cuts in key markets.One consequence of the shift towards the internal EU market over recent years has been a decline in amounts available for export to international markets. Nevertheless, third country markets continue to provide an important alternative outlet for Irish beef and I will continue my efforts to ensure that as many of these markets as possible are open to our exports.  The re-opening of markets in Saudi Arabia and South Africa in 2007 and, more recently, in the Philippines and Israel demonstrates that our BSE controls are working effectively.  Work on opening other markets is continuing and a Market Access Group supports our efforts in this regard.Notwithstanding these favourable factors, we cannot afford to be complacent. The development of non-price strategies is fundamental to meeting evolving market challenges.  Consequently, and in line with the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan, a number of policy initiatives have been developed and enhanced.Amongst these are the Animal Welfare Scheme for Suckler Herds and the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme.  The Animal Welfare Scheme collects genetic data from suckler farms around Ireland for analysis by ICBF.  This will expedite the genetic improvement of, and add significant value to, the national beef herd by allowing farmers to select the most profitable breeding animals for their farms.The Beef Quality Assurance Scheme, which is administered by Bord Bia, plays a vital role in reassuring consumers that they are purchasing a safe, quality product, fully traceable across the production system from ‘farm to fork'.  Funding is also continuing for the beef breed improvement programmes being progressed by ICBF with major advances expected through the use of sophisticated science and technology in this field.With a view to developing markets, Bord Bia is implementing a marketing strategy for Irish beef for the period 2008 to 2013 based on the overriding principles of differentiating and re-positioning Irish beef.  This strategy is focused on the key characteristics of Irish beef — traditional grass based production, full traceability and quality assurance — and the targeting of high-value niche markets.Finally, I should mention the Beef Forum.  This was established to examine the beef sector and to identify the opportunities and challenges facing it, thus allowing a framework for future development to be set out.  I believe that all these measures, combined with our high level of food safety standards, will best position the Irish beef sector to maintain and improve its competitiveness in EU and international markets.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1312	The school to which the Deputy refers is among a number of schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The school in question did not apply for a review at that time.Following the introduction of DEIS, a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.  Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in Budget 2009 in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.

Pupils who are eligible for transport to the education centre in the catchment area in which they reside may avail of ‘catchment boundary' transport to an education centre in another catchment area provided spare seats are available on the school bus.In general, such tickets are allocated on a "first come first served" basis.  The family should liaise with the Transport Liaison Officer in Co. Kildare VEC in relation to the availability of catchment boundary tickets.

The meeting provided me with an opportunity to explain at first hand the context for the budget changes that were of concern to the Bishops and the schools serving the Church of Ireland and other minority churches.  In the course of the meeting, I confirmed my budget day announcement that the funding provided through the Protestant Block grant was being continued by the Government.  I explained that against a backdrop of a difficult economic and fiscal situation I had to take decisions that impacted on the staffing and the range of funding grants to schools generally. The decision to cease paying certain grants to the Protestant fee charging schools, that were not paid to other fee charging schools, has to be viewed in that wider context.It was inevitable in the difficult financial circumstances that the education budget for 2009 could not be totally spared from the need to curtail expenditure but it is important to reiterate again that the Protestant Block Grant which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million will continue to be available and the retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  Historically this payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the Churches concerned.I fully appreciate the concerns that were expressed to me about the needs of the dispersed minority population and the particular need to sustain schools in the Protestant tradition that are directly serving that dispersed population in particular areas of the country.  In that regard, I expressed my willingness at the meeting to respond positively to any proposals that might be made to my  Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the dispersed schools that they wish to attend.  The Bishops indicated that they would reflect on how the funding I am continuing to make available might best be deployed to meet the needs of their schools.My Department has not received, as yet, any proposals from the Church of Ireland Board of Education.  However, further meetings can be scheduled at any point to develop and build on what I believe was a useful and constructive discussion.

In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed a specified amount, which is €20,147 in the 2007 tax year. On the operative date, 31st December 2007 for the 2008/09 academic year, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term Social Welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not  interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1320	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule it is a fact of life that one single pupil change in enrolment can cause a school to lose or gain a teacher. In recent years when improvements were being made to the staffing schedule it was also the case that there were winners and losers depending on individual enrolment profiles. If I were to change the staffing schedule to allow the schools that are due to lose a teacher to retain that teaching post I would be treating them differently from other schools with the exact same number on the rolls and I do not propose to do so.I have a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar enrolment.  The system should not create anomalies or operate on the basis that one or more schools should be treated differently to others.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1322	I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 to 287, inclusive, together.The Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) was introduced in 1998 and projects with a total value of €865 million have been approved to date under the four cycles of the programme. A call for proposals in relation to the fifth cycle of the programme, which I announced in January with funding of €300 million, has issued. The PRTLI is the most significant research  programme supported by the Department. It supports the building of strategic institutional research capacity, enabling the establishment of research centres and facilities, and joint research programmes and national initiatives.The objectives of the programme are:To enable a strategic and planned approach by third-level institutions to the long-term development of their research capabilities, consistent with their existing and developing research strengths and capabilities and national goals.To promote the development of high quality research capabilities in third-level institutions, so as to enhance the quality and relevance of graduate output and skills.Within the framework of these objectives, to provide support for outstandingly talented individual researchers and teams within institutions and the encouragement of co-operation between researchers both within the institutions and between institutions  having particular regard to the desirability of encouraging inter-institutional co-operation within the two parts of the binary system and within Ireland, the EU and internationally.In 2004 an international Assessment Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the PRTLI. The impact assessment concluded that the programme had very positive impacts on institutional strategic planning, inter-institutional co-operation and on the quality of research being produced in Ireland. It endorsed the essential link between research and teaching and learning, and  considered the programme to be ambitious and far-sighted and vital to underpinning the development of the research system in higher education.  Preparations are underway for a further impact assessment of the programme to be conducted this year.The Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), which was introduced in 2006, is a major catalyst in bringing about substantial change and quality improvement in our higher education institutions, and promoting system-wide collaboration that draws on all institutions collective strengths.  The strength of the Irish higher education system, which consists of a relatively large number of institutions with diverse missions, will only be fully realised through institutional collaboration. Projects approved under the Fund are aimed at  institutional reform, enhancing teaching and learning, improving access and life long learning and enabling the development of fourth level activity.SIF was designed:To enhance the delivery of core activities of education and research, through effective and creative institutional and inter-institutional collaboration and including, where necessary, appropriate internal restructuring and rationalisation efforts;To support enabling measures to prepare for the expansion and development of post-graduate education (including expansion and development of graduate schools), including both intra- and inter-institutional collaboration;To support innovation and quality improvement in teaching and learning, including enhanced teaching methods, programme restructuring, modularisation and e-learning; andTo support access, retention and progression both at individual institutional level and through inter-institutional, sectoral and  inter-sectoral collaboration.In accordance with the terms of the National Development Plan, the impact of the SIF will be reviewed in 2010 to inform the assessment of policy in this area.  The detailed project and institutional information sought by the Deputy is being compiled and will be supplied to the Deputy shortly.

The vast majority of these circulars were printed in the Department.  The amount spent by my Department on posting circulars to schools etc. cannot be separated from the overall cost of postage including bulk postage issued from  my Department.  My Department's total expenditure on bulk postage, which is the general means of distributing circulars etc, for the years in question is as follows:Year€20041,313,203.7520051,458,607.3320061,652,104.1620071,546,530.8720081,655,664.61This figure includes the cost of posting a variety of materials to schools and teachers including circulars, payslips (approximately 2.1 million payslips are issued annually), publications, etc. It should also be noted that my Department agrees on occasion to circulate relevant materials produced by other organisations to schools, and that therefore the postage cost given above does  not exclusively relate to material emanating from my Department.My Department regularly reviews its postage arrangements with a view to achieving maximum value for money. In this regard, my Department introduced a system of regular bulk mailings to schools in order to avail of discounted rates and to minimise postal costs. In addition, the rollout of the Department's Online Claims System, which enables schools to submit claims electronically to the Department, has resulted in a reduction in postage costs at both Department and school level of approximately €500,000 per annum. In a further effort to reduce the costs of printing and distribution of publications in 2009 it is now corporate policy within my Department that all publications will be web based and will only be printed and distributed by post in exceptional circumstances.

It will include guaranteed timeframes for the assessment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.This new, significantly more customer-oriented system of administration will provide for a more simplified and accessible applications system, much greater speed and consistency in processing student grant applications, more transparency and accountability in the awarding of grants and regular, on-time EFT payments for students.The Bill concluded Second Stage in the Dáil on the 30th April 2008 and it is anticipated that it will progress to Committee Stage shortly. A number of amendments are currently being considered, arising from a review of the Bill following the Second Stage debate and further consultations since publication.The passage of the Bill will facilitate progress on the two other significant pillars of this project, the development of a single unified grant scheme and consolidation of the administration of student grants into the VEC sector.  The Department is working closely with the IVEA and other relevant stakeholders to develop the new administrative structures required to support more efficient  and effective delivery of the new unified grants scheme.

In this context, a new 8 classroom school was provided in September 2008 for Gaelscoil Portlaoise.  A new 16 classroom school was constructed for Portarlington Convent National School.  Construction has also commenced on a new 8 classroom school for Emo.A new 8 classroom school for the Convent of Mercy in Borris in Ossory was included in my announcement of 23rd January, to proceed to tender and construction.  In Mountrath, a new Community School catering for 650 pupils commenced construction in July 2008. It is envisaged that it will be ready for occupation in September, 2009.As part of the first Bundle of PPP projects, two post-primary schools catering for 850 pupils each will be built in Portlaoise. These projects which are on the one site will accommodate St. Mary's CBS and Scoil Chríost Rí.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently identifying the areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level in the medium to long term. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Those areas identified that require additional capacity will be addressed in the context of my Department's  Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1326	Currently there are 282 prefabricated units being rented by 116 schools in Cork city and County. The total annual rental cost amounts to €4 million.  Rental of these units commenced as follows:Year2008/9462007/8932006/7602005/627The rental of the remaining units commenced during the period 1999 to 2005.In general, the Department approves the purchase or rental of prefabricated classrooms based on need at the time of application. Local school managements then organise their class numbers, year on year, to achieve the optimum local efficiencies. In all cases school managements are required to seek 3 tenders to achieve value for money before approval is given to rent, with the lowest suitable tender being approved.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However, it was decided to prioritise the placement of the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible.The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over €100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country, thereby reducing the demand for prefabs.It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame.
