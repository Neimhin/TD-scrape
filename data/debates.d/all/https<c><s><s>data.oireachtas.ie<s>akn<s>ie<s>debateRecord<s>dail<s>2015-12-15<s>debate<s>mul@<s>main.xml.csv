#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	1	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am very pleased to introduce the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill to the House today and I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions. I would like to begin by highlighting the main objectives of this Bill. First, it provides for several key changes to bankruptcy law in Ireland. These are that the normal duration of bankruptcy is reduced from three years to one year; the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order, which concerns the payments a court may direct the bankrupt person to make towards his or her creditors, is reduced from five to three years; and a bankrupt person's legal interest in his or her home will revest in him or her after three years, subject to certain exceptions. These significant changes will ease the impact of bankruptcy on the large majority of bankruptcy cases who did not seek to go bankrupt and who have co-operated in an open manner with the bankruptcy process and handed over income and assets towards repayment of debts. In such a situation, the bankrupt person will be able to exit bankruptcy and return to normal economic activity much more quickly in line with the position in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Second, the Bill provides for significant sanctions to deter and penalise any bankrupt person who do not co-operate with the bankruptcy or who tries to conceal his or her income or assets from creditors. In such cases, the High Court will retain the power to extend the bankruptcy term to up to eight years and to extend the duration of a bankruptcy payment order to up to five years. In addition, a new provision will allow the High Court to extend the bankruptcy term to up to 15 years where it is satisfied that there has been particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment. Third, the Bill modernises key aspects of bankruptcy procedures. It will abolish the outdated requirement for a statutory sitting of the court in all bankruptcy cases, provide an effective power for the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties and ensure that the official assignee has clear powers to demand and investigate electronic records relating to a bankrupt's assets and affairs. While these changes are procedural, they are nevertheless vital as they will remove unnecessary costs and delays, free up court time and resources and allow more efficient and effective bankruptcy administration. Fourth, the Bill sets out appropriate transitional arrangements so that people already in bankruptcy will also be able to avail of these reforms subject at maximum to a six-month transitional period.  Before I set out the Bill's provisions in more detail, I would like to note that the overall thinking behind the Bill has been influenced in particular by the Private Members' Bill on reducing the bankruptcy term to one year sponsored by Deputy Penrose, which was published in March this year and whose provisions have been incorporated into this Bill, and by the report on bankruptcy reform completed last summer at my request by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality chaired by Deputy Stanton. I thank him for the work done by him and members of the committee. The joint committee held a public consultation and examined more than 100 submissions before providing me with its report in July which likewise recommended reducing the bankruptcy term to one year. I thank Deputy Penrose for his interest and work on this matter and once again express my appreciation to the joint committee for its detailed work and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the many stakeholders and individuals who made very valuable submissions. I think Deputies will agree that this Bill represents an important milestone. It comes at the right time as it complements the significant reforms that we have already introduced since 2012, including the enactment earlier this year of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act and the commencement in recent weeks of the new independent court review of the so-called "bank veto", that is, where creditors reject a personal insolvency proposal. Other recent developments include the waiver of court and Insolvency Service of Ireland fees for insolvency cases, a substantial reduction in bankruptcy costs and the putting in place of a nationwide network of dedicated mortgage arrears Money Advice & Budgeting Service centres, including provision of information and support at all repossession hearings. This is happening at all repossession hearings and I urge people to avail of those services.  I will now turn to outlining the thematic provisions of this Bill. Under the Bill, the normal duration of bankruptcy will be reduced from three years to one year, as recommended by the joint committee in its report. This will also correspond to the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The report of the joint committee expressed concern that reducing the bankruptcy term should not benefit bankruptcies which appeared to be deliberate or fraudulent. The Bill responds to that concern by retaining provision for a considerably longer bankruptcy term - up to eight years and, in particularly serious cases, up to 15 years - where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt is not co-operating with the bankruptcy or has tried to conceal assets or income. Bankruptcy payment orders are court orders made on the application of the official assignee which require a bankrupt to make payments for the benefit of his or her creditors from any surplus income or assets after reasonable living expenses for the bankrupt and any dependants. The Bill will reduce the normal maximum duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five to three years. However, the maximum five-year duration will still apply in cases where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt has not co-operated with the bankruptcy or has tried to conceal assets or income. When a person becomes bankrupt, his or her interest in any property he or she owns, including his or her home, passes automatically to the official assignee whose duty is to sell it, if feasible, to repay his or her creditors. Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act protects any spouse or civil partner of the bankrupt by requiring the official assignee to apply to court for leave to sell the home if it is a family home under the Family Home Protection Act 1976 or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010. The official assignee will try to dispose of the bankrupt's interest in the property, preferably to the spouse or civil partner. However, in many cases and particularly where the property is in negative equity, no purchaser can be found. The Bill proposes a practical solution in such cases by providing that the bankrupt's interest in the home will automatically revest in him or her three years after the bankruptcy adjudication unless the court orders otherwise, the bankrupt and the official assignee agree otherwise or the official assignee has sold it or applied for a court order authorising sale before that date.A similar provision already applies in England and Wales. This applies to the bankrupt's home at the date of bankruptcy adjudication, whether it is the family home, shared civil partnership home or principal private residence as a single person. This will also allow for more efficient and cost-effective administration of bankruptcy cases, particularly those with very limited resources. It is important to note that the bankrupt's interest in the home remains subject to any mortgage so the position of the mortgage lender is not affected. The Bill introduces a new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term up to a total of 15 years on application by the official assignee where the court considers it just to do so in cases of particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt. The reason is that a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of such conduct by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent. The new 15-year maximum term is modelled on the approach in the US and UK. In the US, a bankrupt's debts are only discharged if he or she has co-operated with the bankruptcy trustee, equivalent to our official assignee. In the UK, legislation allows the bankrupt to remain subject to continuing bankruptcy restrictions for up to 15 years in case of non-cooperation, a "bankruptcy restriction order". The Bill will abolish the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act to hold a "statutory sitting" of the court in every bankruptcy case, some weeks after adjudication, which must be attended by the bankrupt, the creditors and the official assignee. The original purposes of the statutory sitting are now superseded and it is widely seen as an outdated formality which creates unnecessary legal costs and workload for debtors, creditors and the official assignee, and is a major strain on court bankruptcy resources. Its abolition will free up considerable time for the courts and the official assignee and will also benefit the parties. The Bill will clarify the wording of several provisions in the Bankruptcy Act to put it beyond doubt that electronic as well as paper records are covered by the powers of the court or the official assignee to demand accounts and records for the purposes of investigating a bankrupt's affairs. This arises in only a few high-asset cases but is important to assist the official assignee in investigations where a bankrupt may have concealed assets. The Bill will allow the official assignee an effective power to refuse to accept responsibility for any property of the bankrupt which is likely to generate substantial costs and where there are no funds in the bankruptcy estate to cover these costs. This is an important provision. When the official assignee takes over a bankrupt's property, he becomes legally responsible for any costs and liabilities arising from it. These may include unpaid rates, property tax, management charges, essential repairs, ongoing security and insurance of properties which may not be generating any revenue. At the same time, the official assignee has no power to compel any contribution from the secured lender who is entitled to receive any proceeds of sale of the properties. Consequently, these costs risk being imposed on the State and the taxpayer. The current provision for disclaimer in the Bankruptcy Act effectively only applies to liabilities arising under a lease, which does not cover the many sorts of liability I have mentioned. In the UK this problem has been addressed by the Insolvency Act 1986, which gives the official assignee a broad power to disclaim any onerous property, meaning that such costs are, more appropriately, the responsibility of the secured creditor who will receive the benefit of the property concerned. The proposed amendment in this Bill follows the same approach and will generate considerable savings for the State and the taxpayer as well as improving the efficiency of bankruptcy administration. Any bankruptcy already existing when the Bill comes into effect will also benefit from the changes introduced by this Bill subject to a six-month transitional period. This reflects the six month transition period provided previously when the bankruptcy term was reduced from 12 years to three years by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. It is needed to ensure sufficient time is available to ensure a smooth transition and to make any necessary applications to court for extension of time in cases which raise possible issues of non-cooperation or attempted concealment. Under the transitional provisions, and assuming that there are no grounds for extension, an existing bankruptcy, which was due to terminate three years after adjudication, if it is already due to terminate less than six months after the commencement date, will terminate on its due date, otherwise it will now terminate one year after adjudication or six months after commencement if that is the later date; an existing bankruptcy payment order which was due to expire five years after it was made by the court, if it is already due to expire less than six months after the commencement date, will terminate on its due date, otherwise it will now expire three years after it was made or six months after commencement if that is a later date. The provision for revesting of the bankrupt's interest in the family home applies to a bankruptcy which exists at the date the Bill comes into effect. Revesting takes place, subject to the usual exceptions, either on the third anniversary of adjudication or six months after the commencement date, whichever is the later. The technical content and effect of each section in the Bill is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum. Sections 3 to 5 deal with the "statutory sitting", and sections 6 and 7 relate to electronic records as I have explained. Section 8 is an important provision, which amends section 56 of the Bankruptcy Act to ensure that the official assignee has a strong and effective power to disclaim property of a bankrupt which is subject to costly liabilities. Section 9 deals with issues regarding the family home. Section 10 is another important provision which amends section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 to provide for two of the main purposes of the Bill, reduction of the bankruptcy term and revesting of the bankrupt person's home. Subsection 10(a) reduces the normal duration of bankruptcy from three years to one year and provides transitional arrangements for bankruptcies already in existence at the commencement of this section. Subsection 10(b) concerns the revesting. Section 85(3F) is a transitional provision which I have detailed. Section 11 deals with the extension of time when somebody does not co-operate. Section 12 reduces the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order. Electronic records are also dealt with in section 15.  In conclusion the background of our economic crisis means that many of those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have been struggling with intractable debt for several years. The measures in this Bill will give people in serious debt who have no disposable income an earlier return to normal economic activity. As the Small Firms Association has underlined they will particularly help small entrepreneurs. At the same time the Bill includes strong provisions to ensure that any bankrupt who tries to conceal resources from creditors or evade their obligations will end up with a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order. It also makes important changes to modernise bankruptcy procedures, reduce unnecessary costs and ensure that the official assignee has effective powers to focus on the small minority of bankrupts where there may be issues of fraud and concealment. This Bill provides a further example of this Government's commitment to bringing forward practical reforms to ensure a more enlightened, less punitive, less costly approach to help people struggling with debt to return to solvency. I commend the Bill to the House.

The legislation reduces the bankruptcy term from three years to 12 months which is a very short period. It will not go unnoticed that less than three years after reducing the bankruptcy term to three years we are reducing it further. While it brings us into line with Northern Ireland and Britain it does mean that our bankruptcy laws will be out of line with most other jurisdictions. We hope there are enough protections in the Bill to prevent abuse by rogue business people. We have to learn from the past when some individuals got away scot free with reckless activity. The need to match this Bill with stronger legislation on white collar crime cannot be understated. On balance, however, we accept the Bill and will support it. Last week the Cabinet rushed to get this bankruptcy Bill approved with a meeting taking place over the phone to approve the new legislation. Approval was required by Wednesday of last week to ensure the legislation would be enacted by Christmas. Earlier this year in the Dáil the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, poured cold water on proposals to reduce the current term for discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. In response to questions from Deputy Michael McGrath he stated:Currently there is a lack of analysis of unintended consequences around further reducing the bankruptcy term to one year. I would be concerned that if we act in haste on this issue, without having conducted rigorous analysis of the objectives and impacts of such a change, we may not achieve the best outcomes for entrepreneurs or private individuals.Despite his warning about acting in haste, the Attorney General was told just two weeks ago to draft a Bill. On the aims of the Bill, it includes five key provisions: it reduces the automatic period for discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one; it reduces the term of bankruptcy payment orders from five years to three; it provides that where the family home has not been sold by the official assignee after a three-year period, it will revest in the bankrupt person; it increases the sanctions for those who fail to adequately co-operate with the official assignee during the bankruptcy process; and it abolishes the practice of the statutory sitting, whereby a bankrupt person was obliged to attend court after the adjudication of bankruptcy and make a full disclosure of his or her property. Section 85 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, as amended by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, provides for automatic discharge after three years. The change to the bankruptcy term smacks of a last minute attempt to create a semblance of something being done. Families who are struggling to repay their mortgage need far more done to help them to stay in their homes. For four years the Government resisted taking action to remove the bank veto. Following further questioning in the past month by Fianna Fáil, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order this week for all remaining provisions of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act. Not one family has, as yet, benefited from this provision owing to the delay in signing the commencement order.  There is the prospect of EU harmonisation of bankruptcy arrangements. The European Commission, in its recommendation, dated 12 March 2014, on a new approach to business failure and insolvency, suggested entrepreneurs should be discharged after three years. The cornerstone of any bankruptcy system should be fairness, not only to debtors who become bankrupt but also to creditors who have had their debts included in a bankruptcy. It should also be proportionate in striking a balance between the rights of creditors and the needs of debtors to seek relief from their unmanageable debts. According to the Association of Personal Insolvency Practitioners:The financial failure of some consumers is an inevitable part of any modern credit-based society and can arise for a number of different reasons: economic downturn, unemployment or illness. Often the media highlight the irresponsible or feckless behaviour of some debtors, but in our experience these examples are the exceptions to the rule and are unrepresentative of the majority of debtors.I will now deal with the arguments in favour of reduced bankruptcy terms. A one-year term would make the financial institutions engage more with debtors in reaching meaningful solutions and encourage further engagement with the debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement processes. It would pass on the benefits of economic recovery to all citizens by allowing people with crippling levels of debt associated with credit obtained during the economic boom to move on from that debt. This would allow the debtor to return to economic normality much faster. It is necessary to aid the economic recovery of the State and enable many of those caught up in bankruptcy to become positive contributors to the economy as quickly as possible. Commercial and consumer debts running to billions of euro have been sold to various funds and further sales are due to take place. It is difficult to predict how tough these funds will be on debtors in the future. Changing the bankruptcy term to one year would generate a more level playing field. It is important that appropriate safeguards be put in place to address situations where the bankrupt is not co-operative or acts in bad faith. There are arguments against reducing the bankruptcy period to one year, as follows. The view was expressed to the justice committee that looked at this issue that the reduced time period of one year would make it too easy for the bankrupt to defer asset and income acquisition until after the expiry date. In addition, newer debt solutions such as the PIA or debt settlement arrangement would become less attractive. An alternative would be that the official assignee be given the right to apply to the High Court to discharge the bankrupt earlier. This would occur where the bankrupt had co-operated with the process and there was nothing further to be gained by enforcing the full period of three years. The official assignee is concerned that if a change to one year was made, Dublin could become the bankruptcy tourism capital of Europe and that the Insolvency Service of Ireland would not have adequate resources to handle the extra work arising therefrom. However, if the Irish courts were to adopt the same robust approach as in Northern Ireland, Dublin would not be as attractive to Europeans seeking bankruptcy. Mr. Brendan Burgess of www.askaboutmoney.com was quoted as saying:There is a danger in reducing the bankruptcy period to a fixed one year that people may game the system as the term is so short ... The current widespread existence of deep negative equity is temporary and will not persist forever. With house prices recovering and with more conservative lending, it will probably be rare in a few years' time to find a borrower in deep negative equity. It's important to design legislation for the long term and not just for today's problem.I also wish to quote Lisduggan District Credit Union which has stated the one-year term:would constitute too easy a channel for individuals to enter in order to avoid having to take reasonable responsibility for debt incurred. In the case of a credit union, such a debt represents other members' savings and it is only equitable that there should be some level of endurance undergone before such funds have to be written off.From a debtor perspective, while a reduction in the bankruptcy discharge term to one year might seem attractive, bankruptcy retains some severe disadvantages and restrictions and is not to be entered into lightly. Proponents of a reduced discharge period cite the increased probability of the bankrupted person retaining the family home, but this flies in the face of the following facts: some 75% of bankrupts end up losing the family home; the bankrupt is a persona non grata with banks, will lose his or her bank account and credit cards and is disbarred from seeking credit in excess of €600; the bankrupt's credit rating is effectively destroyed; the bankrupt may lose his or her job due to bankruptcy status and may well be disbarred from seeking certain forms of employment; and the bankrupt may not become a company director for the period of the bankruptcy. It is clear, however, that reducing the bankruptcy term would not solve the mortgage arrears crisis, despite the impression one might get in listening to some commentators. Nothing could be further from the truth. Reducing the bankruptcy term is one element of a far wider programme of measures needed to deal with families and businesses in financial difficulty. Over 38,000 families have been in mortgage arrears for more than two years. The reality is that bankruptcy will not be a silver bullet for most of them. Earlier this year the Minister for Finance said that of those who had a family home and were declared bankrupt, approximately 70% would lose their home. They become homeless and have to seek social housing from their local authority as a result. Bankruptcy may be suitable in certain circumstances, but it is not a solution for the vast majority of households whose primary financial difficulty relates to being in arrears on a mortgage. What is really needed are proposals to reduce the number of home repossessions to a minimum. Fianna Fáil provided the Government with a template in the Family Home Mortgage Settlement Arrangement Bill 2014 which would have adapted the under-utilised insolvency service to allow a dedicated mechanism for dealing with the family home. For four years the Government resisted taking action to remove the bank veto. The change to the bankruptcy term is a last minute attempt to create a semblance that something is being done. Families who are struggling to repay their mortgage need far more done to help them to stay in their homes. A new Central Bank report which looks at the causes of long-term mortgage arrears shows that, for those in long-term arrears, the amount by which they have fallen behind in their repayments is increasing in over 80% of cases. This indicates that there is a large cohort of mortgage borrowers who have not had an adequate payment restructuring plan put in place. This timely research from the Central Bank clearly highlights that the current approach being taken to dealing with serious arrears cases has not worked and is never going to work. It is completely unsurprising that high variable interest rates have driven many families into long-term arrears, as they typically end up with a mortgage repayment several hundred euro higher each month. It is also notable that thousands of long-term arrears cases involve a situation where a job loss has occurred or the household has been reduced to a single income since the loan was taken out. Long-term arrears are also more common in households with three or more children. Bankruptcy is not a solution for most people in this situation as it could involve the loss of the family home. The Government should be forcing the banks to put in place revised repayment terms to give a family a reasonable prospect of paying off their mortgage over an extended period of time. In particular, permanent interest rate reduction should be used so the monthly repayment is brought down to a manageable level. The Bill is not a substitute, nor does it deal with the wider issue of rip-off mortgage rates, but it can certainly help families in arrears. Split mortgages, where repayment of a portion of the loan is typically deferred for a number of years, have proven to be far more effective in dealing with arrears situations than simply adding the amount of arrears to the outstanding balance. The Government should force the banks to use this on a far more widespread basis and legislate accordingly if they fail to do so. Last month the mortgage repossession figures provided another indication of how the Government is ignoring the escalating home repossession crisis. Figures show that up to November a shocking 4,440 repossession orders were lodged in the courts. The banks ramped up their repossession efforts over the past year, with 188 homes repossessed in July to September alone, a 92% increase on the same period in 2013. The Government introduced the mortgage-to-rent scheme with the view to keeping people in their homes. However, the scheme has been a complete failure with only 2.9% of the 98,137 mortgage holders in arrears actually applying to use the scheme. The success rate of mortgage holders who have applied to the scheme is equally abysmal, with a mere 3% getting through the application process successfully. More than 15% of mortgage accounts for family homes are now in arrears, which is more than three times higher than the figure at the end of December 2010. The most recent statistics from the Central Bank show that a staggering 117,000 principal dwelling house mortgage accounts are in arrears with almost 60,000 of these in arrears of a year or more. The country is potentially facing up to 25,000 home repossessions next year alone. Homeless figures for families have risen fivefold since January alone. Three families are becoming homeless every single day and 1,570 children are currently sleeping in emergency accommodation. The crisis will get much worse unless the Government shakes itself out of its slumber and develops coherent policies for keeping families in their homes. Fianna Fáil is supporting the Bill. I compliment Deputy Penrose who took the initiative and introduced a Private Members' Bill. I congratulate him on his success in getting the Bill sponsored by the Government in here. Many other Private Members' Bills, which the Government did not oppose on First or Second Stage, have unfortunately been parked and not brought any further.

This chaotic Government tried to kick this issue to touch for as long as it could in asking the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to look at the issue. Both committees were emphatic that we had to move to one-year bankruptcy but still months were allowed pass. Eventually the Government had to accept the demand for a one-year rule. In its last weeks it has struck the Government that maybe those in debt needed some more protection when struggling against the banks. This was a novel thought for the Government, but a blindingly obvious one for those of us working with people in debt in the real world day-in and day-out. I welcome that from the day of commencement a one-year bankruptcy term will be available for everybody in the county, North and South. The use of the boat to Britain to exploit the one-year bankrupt terms there will hopefully come to an end and debtors in Ireland will be able to face up to bankruptcy in our own court systems. I welcome that a businessman facing bankruptcy in Donegal now has the same rights and responsibilities broadly speaking as a businessman in Derry. Regardless of any wishful thinking expressed here today, I am under no illusion that this change will be a panacea to the country’s still huge debt problem. Those most likely to benefit are those with larger, more diverse debts. This is a solution more for the businessperson with many debts, business and personal, rather than for the homeowner whose debt is concentrated in a mortgage on the family home or even in a buy-to-let arrangement. For those people this move will be of limited use as the Government decided a long time ago that they were for the wolves or even the vultures. Let us consider the facts. There were 206 repossessions during the most recent quarter, but that does not include so-called voluntary surrenders. In truth, 422 families lost their homes during this period which was identical to the previous quarter. That means four families a day are losing their homes. When these figures were first published in March 2012 the figure was 165 homes for the first quarter in 2012. Even when arrangements are made with homeowners they are more often than not the most unsustainable kind, such as arrears capitalisation or split mortgages. Despite recent falls, the number of family homes in arrears of over 90 days stands at 8.7% of the total number of homes. In March 2011, the number was 6.7%. That shows the scale of the Government's failure. The idea of a tough Government making the banks act reasonably is well and truly dead. We have a walkover Government that has chosen the banks over homeowners and does not care about the social and economic consequences. My party supports the Bill as a pragmatic step but it is no cure for five years of bad decisions. It is in fact an admission of failure. The Insolvency Service of Ireland has failed to be an effective remedy for tens of thousands of families who found themselves in debt after previous Governments and the banks had ruined the economy. It was supposed to be an alternative to bankruptcy. That we are liberalising our bankruptcy laws here today shows that did not happen. Like every other measure taken by this Government to tackle the debt crisis it has not fulfilled its role. The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that 18,000 people would use the insolvency service in its first year. Even now only 3,000 have made applications. That is a spectacular failure to deliver on one of the Government’s key initiatives to tackle the debt crisis. In case Government spinners get carried away, the impact even for those who qualify for this new arrangement is likely to be the loss of the family home for many. That is how bankruptcy works. A person's assets are evaluated and stripped away leaving the bare minimum. It does not have to be that way of course. There should be legal protections for the family home and solutions short of bankruptcy which protect the family home. However, that is beyond the imagination of the Government. The banks had to come first. The law had to be changed to let banks off the leash so they could repossess at will. Some will suggest the Bill creates a moral hazard. Some of them will have legitimate concerns about the future operations of our insolvency laws, but many of those shouting about moral hazard are perfectly happy to ignore the greatest moral hazard of the banks the people bailed out now repossessing the family homes of those same people. The mortgage crisis rages on with four families a day now losing their home. I hope this step helps prevent some evictions, but the overall pattern is clear. After five years of belated initiatives and failed pet projects we are now in the dying days of this Government tampering with bankruptcy rules. We had the mortgage-to-rent scheme. By October 2015, four years after the scheme was launched only 246 homes had been purchased under the scheme. Only 7% of the number of families the Labour Party claimed would avail of the scheme have been able to use the scheme successfully. A €20 million fund set up to help local authorities access the scheme has seen only €6 million drawn down to date.The Tánaiste set up an independent financial service. Up to €10 million would be paid by the banks in a scheme where we were told more than 2,000 accountants gave financial advice to people in mortgage distress. The banks would pay for each consultation with an accountant, which costs €250. The scheme failed miserably. I hope this Bill does help. My party will support anything that helps struggling homeowners and other stand up to the banks. It is far too late for thousands, unfortunately, and probably in a lot of cases far too little for thousands of others.

I do not suppose anybody in this House will say they welcome the fact that we are talking about bankruptcy, several years after the crash, but this is an important initiative. However, much more is needed. It is extraordinary that moral hazard did not extend to some of the very large debtors in this country who are visibly back in action without having to go through bankruptcy because a different approach was taken depending on the scale of the debts. Moral hazard appears to be for the little people. Many people who got into debt did so because they took risks based on a false premise in the early years of the noughties. Many businesses took extra credit to upscale and then found when the economy fell off a cliff that the payments could not be sustained. I spoke to one business person who told me the bank called the company in to talk about how it might put the business back on track. The bank insisted on getting in an expert to examine the technical arrangements that might improve the income of the business. The individual was forced to spend €12,000 on that process. A number of initiatives were identified to improve the business but when the individual went to the bank they were told the bank would not provide funding. The way back is the problem for many people. In the case I outlined the business is just about keeping its head above water but the bank was not there to help and support it to grow out of trouble. I welcome the fact that the same bankruptcy regime now applies both North and South. The time difference was important. It was offensive to see people availing of the opportunity where they could, going to England, Wales and other places where a different regime prevailed. The main area on which I wish to focus is mortgage arrears. Approximately 350,000 men, women and children in families in the country are in mortgage arrears and approximately 55,000 of those have been in arrears for more than two years. That does not account for local authority housing arrears, which are also sizeable. Mortgage arrears in this country are out of kilter with the rest of the European Union, including countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal. In part, that has to do with the only options that are available for people to house themselves. Traditionally, people only had two options; first, to get a mortgage and buy a house and, second, to go on a housing waiting list. Housing waiting lists have been growing in recent decades so that has not been an option for many, and the option of renting in the private sector has come to the fore as a consequence. Ironically, it is the least secure and most expensive form of housing at the moment. What is needed, in addition to a one year bankruptcy for those who, unfortunately, find themselves in that position, because it is not an easy process for anyone, is more than just that – we need a higher level of intervention if we are to get to the endgame for the families that are affected. What is necessary is to create a one-stop shop for borrowers in distress that is free at the point of use and provides expert financial and legal advice and representation. The last thing people in debt need is to be told to pay for advice. They are the very people who cannot afford it. Among the measures we advocate is to equip the courts to refuse possession orders based on the sustainability of the proposed restructure, mandating a set of restructuring options to be considered in all cases and improving access to the mortgage to rent scheme. Having been involved in a small number of such cases, it is like pulling hen’s teeth to try to get them over the line. One could spend eight or nine months with a family engaged in very dedicated work trying to get it across the line, which is very difficult. We must increase the sustainability of restructures by redefining them to include consideration of the total debts, including residual debt and payments post-retirement. Many people in the pre-crash era took out mortgages at a later point in their life than they would otherwise have done. When their income was reduced, the prospect of going into retirement with a reduced income becomes problematic where there is no prospect of additional income. The reality is that one way or another there will be a cost to the State. There were seven families in the courts yesterday facing repossession orders. That happens on a daily basis in the courts in each county. Some cases are at the end of the process while other people are involved in one hearing after another until they reach the point of no return if their mortgage is not sustainable and other options are not brought into play. By definition, when a family is made homeless due to repossession they will be quite impoverished anyway or else they would have been paying the mortgage in order to avoid repossession. Most likely, they will end up getting rent assistance. In my area, rent assistance is way below the market rent but negotiations take place in order to prevent people becoming homeless. The typical amount provided in rent assistance is approximately €1,300 a month. Such families go on a housing list and if the HAP arrangement is in place, they can work, but if it is not they cannot work. It is stupid not to count the cost of stress because if people do not function optimally one takes away their ability to go back to work and thrive as individuals or as a family. That is an important element of what needs to be done. A more comprehensive arrangement must be put in place, in particular for those in mortgage debt because on its own the bankruptcy will not resolve the crisis. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform listed six principles in terms of dealing with the mortgage crisis. They were transparency, sustainability, dignity, equity, protection of Exchequer funds and stimulation of economic growth. Protection of Exchequer funds means that one does not count the cost, for example, of housing somebody if they end up losing the family home or becoming bankrupt because they will require to be assisted by the State.In terms of respecting dignity, some of the pressures imposed on home owners by the lending institutions, with respect to their constant rounds of demands, have practically broken home owners' spirits. Home owners participating in the money arrears resolution process, MARP, got respite, to some degree, from the constant chasing by the banks where those home owners were under pressure and could not meet the costs involved but that is not a principle that was followed by some banks. With respect to the sustainability aspect, all of a person's debts must be taken into account rather than, for example, only the mortgage issue. The totality of people's debts must be examined to ascertain how they can be helped to get to a point where they can have a sustainable future.  This is important legislation and I welcome that it is being taken today. It was initiated, as a Private Members' Bill, by Deputy Willie Penrose. I echo Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point regarding other legislation. I introduced a planning Bill, which I considered to be reasonable legislation. It was not opposed by the Government and was referred to a committee, of which I am a member. I was persuaded to take that Bill off the agenda on the basis that some of the issues in it would be included in planning legislation to be introduced at a future date. Not one further i was dotted nor t was crossed in that legislation following its referral to the committee. That was a waste of everybody's time. The Government either takes a Bill forward or it does not. It would be interesting if an analysis was carried out of the Private Members' Bills that have been put forward, into the preparation of which Members have devoted much time. Those Bills often contain very good ideas - I am not referring particularly to my Bill - that have not been picked up.

The reason I am speaking on this Bill is that the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which I chair, did some pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill at the invitation of the Minister. We received 122 submissions, the vast majority of which were in favour of reducing the bankruptcy term from three years to one year. Prior to that, we had carried out some work on the insolvency legislation where the term was reduced from 12 years to three years, which at the time was a major change. This is a further development of that.

There is a stigma or a shame attached to bankruptcy. That dates back to when people were lodged in debtors' prisons for not being able to discharge their bankruptcy. That stigma still prevails. One of the submissions suggested that we should stop using the word "bankruptcy" and should use a word such as some form of debt relief or something like that. We all know people and families who have been impacted by bankruptcy. I know one family which lost their home and are now renting a house. That family are three years in bankruptcy and it will take another five years to for them to pay off their debts, so they will have a term of eight years. That period is now being reduced to a total of four years. A certain amount of that family's income has to go to pay their debt. Families such as that family will be impacted in a positive way by this legislation in that they will also benefit from the reductions, even though there are currently in the system, with the giving of a six-month lead-in time or that of one year, whichever is the longer period. I understand that the gross incomes of such families are taken into account when it comes to issues such as the granting of approval for social housing. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, check that with his colleagues because that is not very fair? I know an individual who went into bankruptcy; he has a good job but his gross income is taken into account, even though his net income is quite low because he has to give so much to pay the debt every month. Also, where medical cards are concerned, the same applies. We should examine this aspect of the legislation and examine the impact of bankruptcy on other payments and supports that families have. Bankruptcy is not easy, whether it is for a term of one year or three years. One virtually loses everything. There is a provision in the legislation to safeguard the family home, which I welcome. It reassigns the home back to the person after a period of time. That is a new provision and many people have not picked up on it. I note Deputy Niall Collins said that we should not rush into this, that we should take our time and that there should be more debate on it but we have debated this issue. Two committees - the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality - have examined it. We sought submissions on it and received 122. We held hearings and we prepared an official report on it. This issue has been examined in detail and at length. Not everybody who wrote to us was in favour of reducing the bankruptcy term to one year but, on balance, the committee unanimously felt we should reduce it. We presented our report to the Minister at the start of the summer. The legislation was produced quite quickly and we are processing it today. From what I gather, nobody is opposing it, which is welcome.  My good friend and colleague from Sinn Féin, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, said we were not proceeding as quickly as we should be on this. I have been a Member of this House for quite a while and I think this legislation has been produced quite quickly. What is proposed in this legislation is not trivial, rather it is quite serious. Some people have major reservations about what this legislation proposes but the safeguards built into it are quite good. They go beyond what the joint committee sought. For instance, in extreme cases, people can have their period of bankruptcy extended by the High Court to 15 years where they do not divulge their full assets and so forth. That should act as a major deterrent to people who might try to blackguard the legislation in some way or other. The joint committee observed that a one-year term would encourage the financial institutions to engage more with debtors in reaching meaningful solutions and would encourage further engagement with debt settlement arrangement, DSA, or personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, processes. We also recommended in our initial report a number of years ago that there should be an appeals mechanism. At the time, it was felt that we should try it without one but I note that there is now an appeals mechanism involved where the financial institutions veto the arrangements. I welcome that mechanism.  The reduced bankruptcy term would pass on the benefits of an economic recovery to all citizens by allowing people with crippling debt associated with credit obtained during the economic boom to move on from that debt. I note from some observations - I think a previous speaker made this point - that people like Henry Ford, Walt Disney and others went bankrupt at one stage, came out of it and contributed very positively to society. We want to see people return to economic activity faster than they can at present. A particular context for this would be the issue of negative equity. This would bring us in line with Northern Ireland and other common law jurisdictions, which is quite important. We were told that a family home should be offered a certain element of protection and that is included in this legislation, which is good. One submission expressed the view that banks may be willing to offer forbearance on mortgage debt for one year while the bankrupt goes through the process.That is good. Credit unions said the debt "represents other members' savings and the debtor undertaking a level of endurance before it can be written off is argued as equitable". Bankruptcy is hard, whether it is one or three years. Once one is in it, one is in it. We are giving people an opportunity to emerge from bankruptcy in a faster time than in the past, when it was 12 years. We are moving away from bankruptcy being seen as a thing of shame. In the US, people try and fail and then try again. Others say at least the person tried, had a go, is back again and is benefitting his or her family, himself or herself and the economy and perhaps is employing people as well. We want to move away from the notion of bankrupts being seen somehow as crooks. Many people were caught through no fault of their own because of the economic downturn and ended up facing bankruptcy or other major financial difficulties. I concur with the Minister's call on people to engage with financial institutions and to seek help early if they are under financial pressure. We are trying to make it easier for people to do that in the legislation. The argument was made to my committee that the official assignee should be given the right to apply to the High Court to discharge the bankrupt earlier and this would occur where he or she had co-operated with the process and there was nothing further to be gained from enforcing the full three-year term. I am also happy about the appeals mechanism. There was overwhelming support for reducing the term from three years to one and reducing the associated income payments order from five years to three, which is important and which is also provided for in the legislation. On behalf of colleagues on the committee, I am happy to welcome the Bill and to recognise the fact that there was detailed discussion and consultation with experts in the area. We invited people to make submissions and we received 122 detailed submissions, many of which were personal stories, which we could not use because of the confidentiality involved. People found themselves in bankruptcy and they had struggled for three years or more. This is good legislation, which is being introduced at a good time. I am delighted it will be enacted. The moral hazard issue has been dealt with as well and I am delighted this recommendation from the committee has been taken on board. I congratulate Deputy Penrose on initiating this process.

This is one of the first backbench Bills to be enacted during the Government's five-year term. While I compliment my colleague, it is a great shame on the part of the Government parties that they have introduced Friday sittings and lauded themselves for giving Members an opportunity to bring forward legislation but have not taken any of it on board, with the exception of this Bill. The proposal to reduce the term of bankruptcy to one year is certainly a radical move and a significant departure from old cultural views of dealing with debt. This legislation is a pro-enterprise and a rational measure, and l sincerely hope it will be an effective one. One of the greatest challenges faced by our people from the onset of the global economic and financial crisis was the significant debt that many found themselves engulfed in when the economic tsunami hit the country. Many people, who had been in a position to repay money borrowed from financial institutions in previous years, found that their income had reduced or disappeared altogether as a result of unemployment. Unfortunately, the legislative instruments of the State had not developed any capacity since Independence to deal with the kind of debt crisis we all witnessed. There have been a number of false dawns in the Government's actions to deal with the personal debt crisis, including the utterly impotent Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which left the banks with a veto on proposed settlements by the debtor. It is a crying shame that five years into the lifetime of the Government, in the dying days of the Administration, it feels it is an appropriate time to bring forward this legislation. How many thousands of families have been left unaided by the Government over the past five years?

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	27	The legislation will, hopefully, reach new levels in addressing the crisis endured by so many people over the past number of years. It will amend the Bankruptcy Act 1988 by reducing the automatic period for discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one year; reducing the term of bankruptcy payment orders from five years to three years; providing that where the family home has not been sold by the official assignee after a three-year period, it will revest in the bankrupt person; increasing the sanctions for those who fail to adequately co-operate with the official assignee during the bankruptcy process; and abolishing the practice of the statutory sitting, whereby a bankrupt person was obliged to attend court after the adjudication of bankruptcy and make a full disclosure of his or her property. Many of the proposals contained in the legislation follow the submissions made by my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, which was mentioned earlier by its chairperson. The committee received a significant number of submissions in the area and published a report, which stated there was "overwhelming support for reducing the term". I was struck by two submissions by the Association of Personal Insolvency Practitioners, APIP, and the Free Legal Advice Centre, FLAC. APIP stated: We believe that where debtors have fully cooperated with the Official Assignee and make a full and honest disclosure of all their assets and liabilities, there is no public good served by delaying a debtor's discharge beyond one year... [T]he stigma of bankruptcy and the restrictions associated with it are onerous and harsh and where the bankruptcy arises from no fault of the debtor or through their misfortune, we believe providing a discharge for the bankruptcy after one year is proportionate.In a similar vein, FLAC stated: "For consumers, unexpectedly faced with massive, unexpected over-indebtedness, the three year term of being bankrupt is a long one and the label and connotation of bankruptcy can be a heavy burden for them and their families to face." It was clear that many stakeholders who made submissions to the committee felt the current regime was too onerous. It was also pointed out by a number of them that a reduction in the bankruptcy period, as well as a reduction in the terms of income payment orders, would bring Ireland into line with the United Kingdom and, therefore, make our debt restructuring system more competitive. The legislation, thankfully, follows that line, which is significant. One of the reasons for Ireland's economic success and for our thriving cultural and social life is the fact that we are a small, flexible and open society and economy acting as a bridge between the US and the EU. There are many benefits to this. However, this model also shines a bright and intense light on weaknesses within our economy. One of those weaknesses includes our outdated legislative instruments for dealing with debt, which place too onerous a burden on those seeking a fresh start. As a result of the weaknesses in how we dealt with debt, many Irish debtors opted to file for bankruptcy in England instead of the state in which they had most of their business dealings. European legislation facilitated this easy reorganising of affairs to qualify for UK bankruptcy, often putting businesses here at a loss. By reforming our laws, we, as a country, will become competitive in how we deal with the business people who find themselves in this tough position and, hopefully, will provide a solution to the problems many people still face here. It is important, however, to ensure that the new debt restructuring system is not left open to abuse by individuals who are simply seeking to game the system and leave other businesses at a loss. After all, bankruptcy often leaves other functioning businesses facing bills left unpaid by those granted bankruptcy. There is a need for the new legislation to ensure those who decide to opt for bankruptcy to show the utmost good faith. Failure to do so should disqualify them from any settlement under these proposals. It is up to both the courts and the executive to guard against any abuses which may become apparent following the enactment of this Bill. We have a duty to all citizens, not only those in debt. We must offer a path forward for those who find themselves engulfed in debt, while at the same time protect the interests of those hard-working people who engage in businesses across the country and pay their way. There is a need for a balance to be struck and one area where a balance has not been struck is dealing with the mortgage and housing crisis. It is unlikely that the Bill will significantly address this problem, yet it appears that the Government is seeking to declare that the mortgage arrears crisis will be resolved through bankruptcy, but nothing could be further from the truth. The shocking reality is that more than 38,000 families have been in mortgage arrears for more than two years and bankruptcy will not be an effective remedy for them. In a significant admission, the Minister for Finance stated earlier in 2015 that approximately 70% of those who were declared bankrupt would lose their family home. They become homeless and as a result have to seek social housing from their local authority. That policy does not make sense to me or other Members in the Chamber. By repossessing homes, the banks are simply shifting the problem from their balance sheets to social housing lists, which causes massive distress and trauma for families across the country. While there are many things for which the Government can be lauded, its failure in dealing with the problem of housing and homelessness and in the health service will be a black mark against any of the achievements it tries to claim. While listening to the radio today, I heard that 1,000 children would spend Christmas in a hotel because of the failure of the Government which has prevented the construction of affordable houses in cities in order to drive up NAMA's revenues. It has slashed local authority budgets, resulting in full social housing waiting lists. It has sold off thousands of housing units to US vulture funds as citizens sleep rough on the streets. It has ended the dream of home ownership for many generations with its rules for mortgages and caused many families across the country to be evicted because of its repossession rules. Its legacy in the area of housing will be to its great shame.

I welcome the main thrust of the Bill, which is to reduce the period of discharge for bankruptcy from three years to one. I commend Deputy Willie Penrose who has pursued this issue relentlessly in the past few months and also the valuable contribution of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which is chaired by Deputy David Stanton. I also commend the Minister for Finance for listening to what needed to be done and bringing the Bill to the floor of the House. It will bring Ireland into line with many other countries and provides for enough checks and balances to allow those who are totally overburdened by debt to see some light at the end of the tunnel. At the same time it provides for extended bankruptcy and bankruptcy payment orders where someone is unco-operative or fraudulent. It will give a break to those who are genuinely trying to make a new start and has the capacity to increase the sanctions for those who fail to co-operate. It will also abolish the statutory setting whereby a bankrupt person was obliged to attend court after the adjudication of bankruptcy. Many saw this as a public humiliation. The net effect will be to allow more families to stay in the family home.  I have illustrated some of the positive outcomes that will flow from the passing of the Bill. However, there are a number of anomalies for those who have taken the bankruptcy route under the old system. I have spoken to a person who has been in the bankruptcy process for five months and will have an 18-month term with three years income payments. This, effectively, only reduces his term by six months and he believes he is being penalised for being courageous enough to take the bankruptcy route before the term was reduced. Under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, the ceiling for the debt relief notice has been increased to €35,000 in recent times, but the criteria for access to debt relief notices are too restrictive. MABS deals with people in this category. If one has disposable income of more than €60, assets worth more than €400 or a car with a value greater than €2,000, one is not eligible. These thresholds need to be looked at urgently and increased. Only 500 debt settlement arrangements were made in 2015, which is too low and strongly suggests banks are vetoing many proposed settlements. Some 65% of creditors have to approve the settlement. This figure needs to be looked at again or banks will continue to have a veto. I welcome the commencement in recent weeks of independent court reviews of the so-called bank veto which allows creditors to reject a personal insolvency proposal. That issue is being looked at and not before time. Insolvency was the result of financial madness, not only on the part of consumers but also because of reckless lending. When the legislation to deal with insolvency was introduced, it was at a time when the banks were insolvent and loss-making. The legislation was balanced in favour of the banks, which is no longer the case. There has been substantial recovery in property prices, but it has been confined mainly to urban areas. Provincial Ireland still has a long way to go to catch up. Banks lent vast sums of money on an interest-only basis to individuals on the basis of providing security only to purchase rental property. Unless a financial institution can prove it established the capacity of the borrower to service the debt over a 25-year period and by the age of 70 years, the borrower should be given the option of selling the property and repaying the bank with the proceeds. In such a case, a large percentage of any shortfall should be written off by the bank as it was clearly caused by poor lending practice.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	29	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I welcome the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is being introduced as a result of the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on bankruptcy reform. The Bill will further improve and modernise bankruptcy law and take into account the changes to bankruptcy law proposed by Deputy Willie Penrose in a Private Members' Bill published in March. I thank the Deputy for the work he has carried out on bankruptcy law and congratulate him on the amendments and improvements he has made to this very important legislation. I have no doubt that his contributions have enhanced the Bill.  The Bill will make many changes to existing bankruptcy law, including the reduction of the bankruptcy term from three years to one in all new bankruptcy cases. It will provide for those already in bankruptcy for one year when it comes into force to be discharged from bankruptcy after a six-month transitional period. It will reduce the maximum duration of bankruptcy payment orders from five years to three. These orders require a bankrupt person to pay specified amounts from their income or assets to the official assignee for the benefit of creditors. The Bill will enable the bankruptcy term to be extended to up to eight years in cases where the bankrupt person is concealing income or assets or refusing to co-operate with the official assignees. In such cases a bankruptcy payment order can still be made for up to five years. In very serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment, it will give the court power to extend the bankruptcy term up to a maximum of 15 years. It will provide for the bankrupt person's interest in his or her home to be revested in him or her three years after adjudication if the official assignee has not applied to court within the period for its sale. It will give the official assignee power to disclaim onerous assets. Under Irish law, he or she is obliged to take over legal liabilities on assets owned by the bankrupt person. This can result in the official assignee having to cover expensive costs of urgent repairs and make safe unfinished sites at the taxpayer's expense, while the profits from these assets go exclusively to a small number of creditors. The change will reflect the position in the United Kingdom in order that the beneficiary of the asset will, effectively, take over the liabilities. As a result of our economic crisis many of those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have been struggling with unsustainable debt for the past six or seven years. The background to the economic crisis is the disastrous economic policies of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government. A reduced bankruptcy term and shorter duration for bankruptcy payment orders will provide people in serious debt and no disposable income with an early return to normal economic activity. These changes also constitute a practical boost for entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs. At the same time, the proposals include strong measures to ensure that a bankrupt who tries to conceal resources from creditors, or to evade his or her obligations, will be liable to a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order. Other changes to the legislation will streamline and modernise key bankruptcy procedures and strengthen the powers of the official assignee. These changes will free up the resources of the official assignee to focus on the small minority of bankrupts in respect of whom there are issues of fraud and concealment. The changes will also save unnecessary bankruptcy administration costs to the State, creditors and debtors and will free up court time. The provisions in the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015 complement the reforms which the Government has already introduced, from enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 onwards. They represent a more modern, less costly, and better balanced approach to a return to solvency for people in debt. Before entering politics, I ran an electrical wholesale business. More than most, I understand the difficulties faced by people who run into financial difficulties, in many cases through no fault of their own. During my time in business and, more recently, as a Deputy, I have dealt with many people who have run into financial difficulties. The amendments being made to the Bankruptcy Act 2015 will help those who cannot free themselves from unsustainable debt. The changes being introduced will allow those people make a fresh start from the unsustainable debt that up to now has been a noose around their necks. I would like to put on the record of the House my support for the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, which I believe will be a great assistance to those whose debt is unsustainable and want to make a real and genuine effort to break free from that debt. I also welcome that this legislation will act as deterrent to those who do not want to honour their debts or believe that by hiding their assets they can get away with paying those debts.

I thank the Minister for adopting the central principles of that Bill and enacting them in to law. I also thank all Deputies who engaged in a synchronised advocacy of the Bill on the floor of this House, led by the redoubtable and knowledgeable, from a financial perspective, Deputy Peter Mathews. The genesis of this Bill is a conversation at the kitchen table in my home in Ballynacargy one Friday evening with my two daughters, Aisling, who is a solicitor and, Niamh, who is training to be an accountant, both of whom, having listened to me speak about this issue on many occasions, urged me to do something to address it.  Bankruptcy is no walk in the park. Nobody who makes the decision to invest money or purchase a property does so with the deliberate intention of going bankrupt. That is a misconception. When a person is declared bankrupt the official assignee takes over responsibility for the administration of all of his or her assets and income, leaving that person paralysed in that regard. The official assignee also takes over responsibility for payment of creditors. However, security over an asset, namely, a mortgage on a home, is not impaired by the bankruptcy. Were it taken into account in regard to the bankruptcy, then peculiarly this would be for the better because under section 61(4) of the Bankruptcy Act the official assignee cannot dispose of a bankrupt's home without the permission of the High Court, which court has wide discretion in coming to a decision in that regard and has regard to the requirements and needs of the bankrupt and his or her dependants. I detest the argument of moral hazard. Originally, moral hazard was the responsibility of the lender.

The bankrupt is required to make full disclosure of all assets and income to the official assignee. Also, if there is any change in the bankrupt's circumstances he or she must make that known to the official assignee. Bankruptcy remains a stigma, although perception in that regard is reducing. Bankruptcy is a matter of public record and it affects a person's future credit rating. In that regard, the Government now needs to engage with the Irish Credit Bureau on removal of a bankrupt's bad credit rating after 12 months. It is not right that people would be penalised for life by a credit rating.

This Government is proud to have overhauled Ireland's bankruptcy legislation, thereby leapfrogging the 20th century and replacing harsh and unforgiving Victorian attitudes - debtors' prisons - with the principles of welfare and equal treatment that are the bedrock of the modern Republic that Connolly and Pearse gifted to us with their lives. The aim of this Bill is to give people a second chance so that they can return to normal economic activity as soon as possible. We have to move on from the idea of punishing people who engaged in normal economic activity but suffered economic misfortune due to adverse economic circumstances which nobody could predict. It is vindictiveness at its basic level if we continue down that road. Had other countries continued down that road, people such as Henry Ford, Abraham Lincoln and Walt Disney would have been denied an opportunity to return to economic activity. Northern Ireland has not fallen apart because it introduced a one-year bankruptcy rule.  We have achieved a lot but we need now to address some minor technical amendments, which are self-explanatory, including the revesting of ownership in the family home, which proposal my daughters were instrumental in bringing to the fore and which is essential to the psyche of the nation's mental health and self-esteem. We need to eliminate the wholly unnecessary and embarrassing statutory court sitting and, most importantly, reduce the bankruptcy period to 12 months. Today, we have the opportunity to stimulate the recovery of the forgotten. In reducing the bankruptcy period from three years to 12 months we do so not only to align ourselves with modern nations but because it is the right and proper thing to do. As parliamentarians, it is our obligation to ensure this is done.  The wording of the 1916 Proclamation come to mind at this point. I am reminded that Connolly and Pearse pledged themselves not only to the obvious cause of Ireland's freedom but, as they seized their moment to declare Ireland a Republic and a sovereign State, so, too, did they proclaim and pledge themselves to the cause of the welfare of the Irish people. This is the cause of the Labour Party also. It is on the subject of the welfare of the Irish people that I particularly address this House today. The heroes of 1916 declared the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, to the unfettered control of Irish destinies and, as a nation, to free us from the yoke of usurpation of a foreign government and people. In that great endeavour, they largely succeeded. However, for a great many of Irish people - not just anonymous statistics but real families in real communities in real homes across this land - the yoke of usurpation by foreign people weighs heavily upon real people. That usurpation has worsened with the mass sale of the worth of people's lives to hedge funds and other unregulated entities owned by the very foreigners from whom Connolly and Pearse tried to free us. I speak today not of foreign governments, because that usurpation has been consigned to history, but about the usurpation of the lives of the people of Ireland by invading hedge funds and unregulated entities who have landed on our shores in fleets of private jets. I am not here today to make apologies for real people who followed the trusted advice heaped upon them by banks and financial institutions, who while insolvent, pushed money on the people. As Deputy Mathews has often said, they knew what they were doing was wrong.

The recovery of this economy has been good for many industries, sectors and people but it has left a great many people behind. For these people the recovery is perhaps too late. Perhaps, they are in the wrong sector. We have allowed ourselves languish in the belief - indeed we have allowed ourselves to be deceived yet again by bankers into believing - that unresolved legacy debt was being addressed. Through the fog of public relations and spin it seems that little has been resolved. The bucket has been kicked down the road while banks have strengthened their balance sheets with public moneys and Government support. As the optics now align favourably for the banks, what are they doing?They are selling the bucket. Notwithstanding the improvements in the insolvency process and in legislation, this bucket of unresolved legacy debt is now very much full. The debt has gone nowhere. It has been swirled around the banker's bucket. All that has changed is the owner of the bucket. The debt has not been closed off and people have not been able to get back on their feet. Now those distressed people have to start all over again and deal with the new owner of this toxic bucket except this time the owner of the bucket is foreign, alien, unregulated, mercenary and merciless.  When we listen to the people involved at the coalface dealing with debt and mortgage distress, we hear their despair at the intransigence of financial institutions that continually fail to face up to reality. People are genuinely trying to address their situation, which is clearly new and different to when they entered into their loan or mortgage contract, but the banks and other funds steadfastly refuse to deal with them or be realistic. The pip squeaking is not enough for them and the law of the land has been condoning if not encouraging this behaviour.  I have heard too many stories of people ending up in casualty wards with chest pains. I have heard too many stories of suicide and attempted suicide, often for extraordinarily small sums. It is now time for this sovereign Parliament to address the imbalance-----

Today we declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland. We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the unfettered control of Irish destinies and one small step in that direction is to reduce the three-year bankruptcy period to 12 months. This will achieve two things. It will create some equality of arms between the legacy debtor and the new hedge fund or financial institution involved. It is intended to oblige the hedge funds, which I remind the House are unregulated entities answerable to no one, to take commercial stock of the realities of an application for bankruptcy. The question will be whether these hedge funds would prefer to have to deal with a bankruptcy situation rather than achieving a speedy, purposeful and sensible working out of the situation at a fair price. Connolly and Pearse's declaration of a Republic in 1916 guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunities to all our citizens. They declared their resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally. Sadly, for a great many, recovery cannot happen. Great swathes of this nation are unhappy. It seems to me to be of cardinal importance that the three-year bankruptcy period be reduced to 12 months to offer them some hope. The second benefit is that it will immediately restore confidence.

The dynamic amendment has the capacity to shift the mind space and thinking of distressed persons, who have otherwise abandoned all sense of hope. It is proximate. It is nearly immediate. Closure approaches. It will stimulate them back to recovery and employment and once again to create employment and walk with pride in their neighbourhoods. They will walk as productive and contributing Irishmen and Irishwomen should - free from the yoke of oppression of foreign bankers and unregulated hedge funds. This is a good day and I hope to God it gets better for the many thousands of our fellow citizens who find themselves in financial distress and difficulty. It is clear I support the Bill.

He is right logically, in his mind and in his heart. He has analysed the situation as it is. What is meant by bankruptcy? The banks ruptured this country. Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the lending institutions. They are not lending institutions. They get a licence to take deposits. Only when they know how to lend properly can they use those deposits to generate activity and commerce in the economy. Our banks are measurably guilty at a level of 80% for the asset price bubble on a credit pyramid that went out of control in the seven years from 2001 to 2008 and the €5 million banking inquiry has not even touched on it. That is how pathetic the inquiry was. Boards of directors of the domestic banks in this country went way out of control. They lent all the deposits - the savings of businesses and households - and ramped things up further on a cocaine-fuelled credit pyramid. They more than doubled the size of the domestic banking economy in five years. That is woefully guilty conduct. It left the people victims of the crash and we are now trying to bandage them with a sticky plaster one year bankruptcy term and a hesitancy in clearing the mess up in a manly sort of way. There is a suspicion that most of them are trying to hide things and are perhaps not being honest. It is laughable. I read of the sanctions for non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt but the banks concealed everything. They concealed their balance sheets to such an extent, the last Government gave a blanket liabilities guarantee. This guarantee now has an easily identifiable residual of €25 billion in the Governor of the Central Bank's office desk. It is the so-called genius trick of our Minister for Finance to extend the promissory note of ten to 12 years into a long-dated promissory bond. He had no business doing that. On 18 February next, I hope Deputy Joan Collins will be vindicated in the Supreme Court. The Minister for Finance put the people on the line for €31 billion, at the time, without even legislation being passed in this Parliament. Some €25 billion is still outstanding. Let us think about that €25 billion. We should cancel it because there is no validity in it whatsoever. It has zero validity. If anyone thinks there is a validity to it, let them show it, because there is not. It is the losses of two private banks, namely, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank-IBRC.  We hear people talking about bankruptcy and shame. There is no shame. It is a fact. If people do not have the assets to discharge their liabilities, that is just a fact. It can be compared to a collapse of their bodies. If their hearts are not working, they are just physically ill. That is okay. It does not matter. The cause of a disease or lack of health does not matter. The fact is that they are not well and one brings all the assistance to make them well again. One does not make them a little well or give them Lucozade when they need surgery. The Minister stated: I think Deputies will agree that this Bill represents an important milestone. [The Bill] comes at the right time.What a load of nonsense. That is utterly pathetic. If the medicine or the surgery does not arrive at the time it is needed, it is a waste of time. The Government had five years and massive numbers to do certain things. It did not listen to some of the good ideas on this side of the House. It did not even listen to its own backbenchers. I had that experience because I was once in the Fine Gael party. It did not want to know some good ideas. It had the monopoly on wisdom. If the Government really was compassionate for the Irish people, it would take on board those ideas. They are evidence-based and would make progress. They would cure ills and fix situations. However, the Government will not do that. If we take away the fig leaf of "the fastest growing economy in Europe" and look at the reality, we see that housing waiting lists are at their longest. The number of people waiting for hospital elective surgeries and procedures stands at 400,000. I appeal to God almighty. It is more than the population of Cork. Schools and universities are threadbare and our universities' rankings are slipping. We have homelessness. We have mortgage debt, with 38,000 people in arrears of two years or more. These are the realities. It is argued that a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of concealment by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent. However, the banks fooled the last Government and are currently fooling this one. Does the Government believe there has been any serious or meaningful restructuring by the banks? There has been very little and I know this because I have been involved with a number of cases. It is a farce. The banks are out of operational control and do not know what is happening. The legal divisions of banks are sending correspondence, as are the arrears divisions. The people who are trying to arrange restructuring do not know where they are. That is the reality. I know because I am dealing with it.  Bank of Ireland, when it was lining up assets for transfer into NAMA, mysteriously reduced the prospective bill of lading, or transfer, of €16 billion into NAMA to €12 billion. How in the name of God, back in 2009, could one have a reduction in toxic loan portfolios to be transferred into NAMA? Anyone with even half a brain or half a day's experience in loan ledger management would know that it is impossible but the bank did it. Why? It was done because €4 billion at the then prospective discount rate of 30% amounts to €1.2 billion and that was the reduction of the requirement for recapitalisation which kept Bank of Ireland out of State majority control. The bank fooled us. It fooled us again when a consortium of five investors bought 35% of the bank for €1.1 billion. That was stupid. I told the Taoiseach at the time not to proceed but to pause. Wilbur Ross, who was a genius in his own interests, made €0.5 billion profit on his little proportion of that consortium. It was a one-way bet; he could not have lost. What genius allowed that to happen? The Government should reorder its priorities and put the people of Ireland first rather than the establishment and the vested interests. However, it must do its homework because it has not done it yet. If the Government had done its homework, it would know what to do. The Government has failed, for instance, to send notices of assessment to the multi-national corporations on their profits which have been increasing since 2008. That would have been pushing an open door but the Government did not do it. It was afraid of its own shadow and was pathetic. It was prepared to allow banks to beat up small family businesses while shivering at the prospect of the multinational corporations leaving. Those corporations are now paying that money and the Government is scratching its head and asking where the extra corporation tax is coming from. The corporations know the game is up and that they have to pay it.

He is determined and is like an elephant who digs himself in and refuses to move. In that, he has taught me a great deal about what one has to do to achieve anything in this House. Deputy Penrose is driven by the Labour Party ideal that people should be treated fairly and equally and with the support of our parliamentary party, he was determined that he would progress matters for people who are in the unfortunate position of being bankrupt. As I observed the situation in the past few months, I began to wonder if he would succeed because for a long time Deputy Penrose and the parliamentary party seemed to be knocking their heads against a brick wall. That brick wall is in the Department of Finance and in the permanent government's unwillingness to accept change. A critical element in moving this Bill forward was the fact that Fine Gael backbenchers, through their involvement with their constituents also realised that a serious issue had to be addressed. It took a great deal of pressure from the Labour Party's parliamentary party and the Fine Gael backbenchers to move the issue forward. It is so important that this Bill is before us now, for the reasons outlined by Deputy Penrose earlier. It will put people in a situation where they can begin to live their lives again. It also demonstrates the importance of backbenchers in this Parliament. We have our ears to the ground in a way that the permanent government does not. We know and understand the situation that many people are facing. In that context, it is important that more space be given to backbenchers to promote Bills of their own. While I welcome the Bill before us, it should have Deputy Penrose's name on it.

This Bill is designed to alleviate the hardship and suffering of thousands of families in this country who, in most cases through no fault of their own, got themselves into financial difficulty, egged on by the banking institutions. It is very important that this Bill be enacted as soon as possible. The fact that it has been so difficult to deliver points to the need for greater influence from the floor of this Chamber. It also points to the very important role that the Labour Party plays in this institution. It is important that a party driven by an ideology which demands equality for people is well represented in this Parliament, both now and in the future. I congratulate Deputy Penrose and thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for bringing forward this legislation and I hope that the lives of many people - this Christmas and thereafter - will be greatly eased by it.

He pioneered the Bill which is his achievement. He has been working on it for a long time and brought all of his professional skills to it. Well done to him for this reforming and excellent legislation. There are three reasons the Bill is good. First, it will encourage creditors and banks to engage more with debtors in voluntary arrangements. This will be its greatest achievement in that the banks, faced with the prospect of having to allow bankruptcy, will engage with people in a meaningful and proactive way and people will have a chance to restructure loans and work them out. Second, it will reduce bankruptcy tourism. Where I live along the Border there are many people who travel to Northern Ireland to be declared bankrupt. There are also many people who travel abroad. Third, the Bill will allow people a second start. This is very much part of the culture in America and other countries in that people who fail once are not deemed to be a lifelong failure. The likelihood is that their failure will educate and give them the wherewithal to succeed a second or third time. The risk is that the Bill will make bankruptcy an attractive option, but it never will be. In a small country like Ireland people will for trading purposes try to avoid bankruptcy and the opprobrium that goes with it. The disincentive to enter into bankruptcy remains but the advantages to be gained in getting people out of it quickly will be achieved.  It is a great achievement on the part of Deputy Willie Penrose to pioneer the Bill which will have massive advantages for the economy in future years. I support it and applaud my colleague for his pioneering work.

Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Penrose agus chuile dhuine a bhí páirteach sa phróiseas seo, go mór mór baill an Chomhchoiste um Dhlí agus Ceart, Cosaint agus Comhionannas. I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Willie Penrose and all those involved, in particular the justice committee. Some 80% of the 135,000 jobs created by entrepreneurs were created in Irish SMEs. Fostering entrepreneurship is a very important part of job creation, as is acknowledging failure. People can sometimes make mistakes and things do not always work out. My old accountancy teacher used to say we should never be ashamed to fail in business. A punitive bankruptcy regime does not foster job creation. The Bill provides sanctions for those who evade their responsibilities and do not co-operate in the bankruptcy or conceal income or assets from creditors. It is important that it not be an easy process and that it be monitored. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to develop new and existing businesses and the Bill may also help in dealing with the psychological issues and stress caused by the process of indebtedness. We have all come across this in our constituencies in dealing with the problems faced by homeowners. The legislation is certainly very welcome. I commend all those involved, including the Government, for bringing it to this stage. In particular, I acknowledge Deputy Willie Penrose for the work he has done on it. I commend it to the House and wish it success.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	70	This occasion is poignant for me because it might be my last chance to speak in the House before Christmas. I have to say how genuinely I admire my stubborn colleague in the House because, for me, this is probably the most significant legislation we will have passed in the past five years and there has been some powerful legislation enacted in that time. I am very grateful to Deputy Willie Penrose for tenacity and stubbornness which have ensured the Bill is before us in order that we can vote on it. We have had discussions on this issue before. As a Deputy for the past five years, one of the most difficult things I have had to do on behalf of constituents is deal with banks, the left arm of which does not know what the right arm is doing. I am being gracious in saying this because some of the more sinister elements of the activities of banks in some cases are tantamount to illegality. One State-owned bank will be before the Circuit Court on 26 January to deal with allegations that it hired private investigators and illegally bought information from State bodies. Some of their activities are despicable. The Bill will give people an opportunity to have some breathing space to take care of their debts. They are probably in debt through no fault of their own. I do not often agree with Deputy Peter Mathews, but I agree with what he said today. It does not matter what the cause of the debt is; what matters is that the outcome for everybody and what is wanted by Members of this House is recovery. This legislation will give tens of thousands of people an opportunity to seek recovery and I wholeheartedly commend it. I say, "Well done" to Deputy Willie Penrose.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	71	I, too, commend Deputy Willie Penrose on the work he has done on this Bill, about which we had very long conversations at different stages. In his contribution he mentioned the kitchen table. Very good ideas often come from it and often some very strong family decisions are made at it. The ideas expressed in the conversations that took place at that kitchen table found their way into the legislation, for which I commend the Deputy, as well as for his hard work. I also thank the justice committee for the work it has done in this regard. It reviewed a significant number of submissions in a very speedy manner. I thank all Members of the House. It is a mark of the quality of the Bill and the co-operation received from Independent Members and all of the major political parties that the legislation has been dealt with in such a speedy manner. That a sense of hope and relief will be given to those in bankruptcy will strengthen the hand of those individuals in financial distress. Many Members mentioned the element of stigma attached to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is always hard on the individual and his or her family. It is always a hard decision to enter it. Even with this Bill, no one will make a decision to be declared bankrupt easily. It is a very stressful time. Deputy Willie Penrose has mentioned the impact it has on families. There is no shame in it because the only shame is in not trying. We should ensure those who try to set up a small business will have an opportunity to try again if they are unfortunate enough to go bankrupt. We have to make sure we develop an economy that assists entrepreneurs. If they are unfortunate enough to go bankrupt or run into economic problems, they should be in a position to try again. Deputy Willie Penrose and many other Members of the House have reminded us about the many people who went bankrupt in other societies but came back and built thriving businesses that employed many thousands. I have no doubt that unfortunate investors and entrepreneurs who have gone bankrupt will come back, reinvest in the economy and once again give great hope. The reduction in the bankruptcy term from three years to one is very significant. It is a fundamental change which follows the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. I again pay tribute to it for its work under its Chairman. The change will ease the impact of bankruptcy on individuals who have been struggling with unsustainable debt on a much reduced income for several years. The provision for the revesting of the family home where it has not been sold within three years is another practical and humane solution. on which Deputy Willie Penrose and other Members remarked in their contributions. While I do not have time to deal with all of the contributions made, one point that is significant is that people - 135,000 - are going back to work. This is where I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Peter Mathews. It is not a fig-leaf for any family that a family member has gone back to work. We inherited a situation where 500,000 people, or 15.1% of the working population, were unemployed, but the figure is now back below 9%, which is significant. We have rebuilt a crashed economy. Today we will launch 79 new social housing units. Tonight, Dublin City Council will announce 1,300 new developments in the city alone. I agree society faces many challenges. The provision of housing is a significant challenge, as is improving the health service. However, the main challenge faced over the past five years has been the economy and the need to get people back to work. That issue had to be addressed and the Government has done that. I thank the Chair for allowing me this time.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. In November 2014, I published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016. The areas marked in blue on the map represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services. Those marked in amber show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the amber areas will be included in the State's intervention. The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. The high-speed map contains a breakdown of premises covered per townland. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business. Consumers may also consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and planned future deployment intentions. Over 40 responses were received following the publication of the national broadband plan proposed intervention strategy last July. Non-confidential versions of these submissions are being published and can be accessed on the website. In the meantime my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals. I expect to proceed to formal procurement before the end of this month. The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within three to five years of the contract award. In this context, the national broadband plan proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high-speed services by 2018, with an ambition of 100% coverage by end of 2020.

The Minister expects to proceed to formal procurement by the end of the year, which is in two weeks, so is he fully confident that this will happen or is he 90% confident of it happening? The concern that people have relating to broadband around the country is that it is being promised but it looks like it will be 2021 before high-speed broadband will be available in a number of counties, including Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Mayo, Monaghan, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Kilkenny, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Cork. Representatives of Eir, which used to be Eircom, have recently indicated that the commitment it had for 300,000 homes and businesses to be connected can no longer be fulfilled. Has the Minister taken this into account? He has stated across the floor and in committee rooms that his Department is working as hard as possible on this. There is much concern in the places that do not have broadband as there does not seem to be an absolute commitment to get this over the line once and for all.

As I reminded the Deputy before and will do so again, I stated there would be three key events between July 2014 and December 2015. The first was the publication of the map, splitting the country into areas that the commercial sectors would look after and the rest of the country, in which the State would have to intervene. I said I would do that in November last year and it was done at that stage. I stated at that stage that we would bring forward the full and detailed strategy, including technical, financial and legal aspects, that needed to be dealt with and it would be published in July 2015. I did that. I then stated that the third of that trio of actions that needed to be taken in order to move forward in the process and meet the concerns of the people whom the Deputy speaks about would come by the end of this year. To answer his question, "Yes", it will be done before the end of 2015.

How will that impact on what is now a broadband wasteland? I wrote to the Minister late last week about an issue with exchanges in Kanturk in Cork. Although I do not expect him to comment on that on the floor, it reflects what is happening around the country, with a proper broadband service not being distributed to the villages and towns. Will the Minister specifically comment on Eir's statement about the 300,000 homes?

That will follow a careful and detailed assessment of all the plans, including that of Eir, that has been done in recent months. In all likelihood, I will make those announcements next week, before Christmas.

One of the first things I said when I put questions to the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, was that I felt that the Government had no energy strategy or policy. There was a document with the word "strategy" on it, but it was not really a strategy. As a result, I fully supported the Government when it decided to come up with an energy strategy. I am looking forward to seeing what is included in the White Paper tomorrow and would love to have a sneak preview of it tonight. One essential feature of such a White Paper which sets out the Government's vision for the future is the role semi-State bodies such as Coillte, the ESB and Bord na Móna might play in future energy policy because they have a great role to play in energy generation from renewables.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	84	I thank the Deputy for his comments.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	85	I also thank the Deputy for his comments and wish him well. My engagement with him has been always very satisfactory and I thank him for his unfailing courtesy. He has always addressed the issue, not the man, for which I thank him. The Government has supported a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy, many of which have been successful in encouraging a shift towards using more renewable energy by semi-State companies, including Coillte, ESB and Bord na Móna. The renewable energy feed-in tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. These schemes are open to all interested parties, including relevant semi-State companies.  The ESB has a long history of successfully delivering hydro power, made significant progress in divesting much of its older inefficient thermal plants, is building its renewables portfolio based primarily on wind energy and has established an investment fund tasked with sourcing, evaluating and executing appropriate investments in technologies with breakthrough potential in renewable energy generation. I also welcome the company's commitment to decarbonise its generation activities by 2050. Bord na Móna is also making good progress in the renewable energy space and I understand the company is aiming to develop wind farms on land that was previously used for peat production. I was pleased to see in October this year that Bord na Móna published its Sustainability 2030 report, which outlined its plan to replace its use of large-scale peat production with alternative energy sources, including biomass, wind and solar energy by 2030. Many of the technologies identified in the report will be eligible for support under the new renewable support schemes under development by my Department. It is also important to note that EirGrid and the ESB are co-ordinating effectively to ensure the timely connection of increasing levels of renewable generation from all interested parties on the national electricity grid.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House 
 My Department is in the process of designing a new renewable heat incentive scheme to encourage an uptake of renewable energy in the heat sector and also working on the introduction of a new renewable electricity support scheme. Both new schemes are expected to go live at the end of 2016, subject to Government approval and state aid clearance, and will be open to all interested parties.  In the transport sector it is my intention to continue to support the deployment of sustainable biofuels through increases to the biofuels obligation scheme. The first such increase will take effect on 1 January 2016. The scheme has successfully incentivised an uptake in the use of biofuels in Ireland in both the semi-State sector and the private sector and will continue to do so. In October 2014 my Department published a draft bioenergy plan in which a number of actions were outlined specifically designed to support the uptake of renewable energy. The draft plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass in the coming decade. In this regard, the key recommendations include continued support for the afforestation programme, the continuation of the bioenergy scheme for energy crops and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na Móna and Coillte. The energy White Paper which I intend to publish tomorrow will provide the framework for accelerating the development and diversification of renewable energy generation.

It is about more than the semi-State companies using renewable energy. In addition, I thought that there would be a co-ordinating and leadership role and that they would share their expertise in exploring different forms of renewable energy. Will the White Paper address the issue of community energy co-operatives? I know that the Minister is talking about the energy citizens concept, but it can be nebulous. The community energy co-operative is very specific, working in other countries and means that the citizen can buy-in and there is immediate benefit from renewable energy developments. Will the Minister consider the semi-State companies having such a co-ordinating or leadership role and the potential of community energy co-operatives in reaching the targets to which we agreed in Paris?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	87	The Deputy is right. The ambition underlying the Paris agreement calls for considerable change across the world, including Ireland. We have made decisions and are required to make more to ensure we can credibly decarbonise the economy, which is the objective. The issue of community energy co-operatives will be addressed in the White Paper. I agree with the Deputy that there is enormous potential in that regard. I again agree with him on the need for co-operation between semi-State bodies. He will be aware of the establishment of Bionergy Ireland, a key action in the draft bioenergy plan. Coillte is under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. While I do not have any role in its governance, a steering group that includes representatives of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, newERA and my Department is working on the Bionenergy Ireland plan which, as the Deputy is aware, involves Coillte and Bord na Móna. I am sure there will be other initiatives also.

It is good to hear his response. I look forward to the White Paper. If the Minister can see his way to giving me a sneak preview of it tonight, I might be able to make a better contribution tomorrow at the official publication. My final question concerns the role of educational establishments and universities. Has the Minister thought about talking to the educational establishments? This will be a continuing challenge for the next ten, 20, 30 or 40 years and Ireland needs people who are trained to maximise the benefits of renewable energy generation. Will the Government and semi-State agencies talk to the universities to make sure the education sector will meet the challenges of tomorrow?

We need excellent research in order that we can direct and have a plan in place to decarbonise the economy that will involve the State at its best in giving leadership and the funding of research in new areas such as the smart grid, into new products or ways of organising our renewable energy portfolio. The research institutions will be central to that process in which innovation will be critical to the transition to the decarbonisation of the carbon. The Deputy is right. We have very fine institutions such as Beaufort Research in Ringaskiddy, County Cork which does amazing and critically important work, as well as people in Galway and UCD who are researching integrated energy systems. Publicly funded research will be at the heart of the job we need to do.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	92	The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy for all consumers. A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility is essential for Irish consumers. Fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix as we transition to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050. The choice of fuel used in the plant at Moneypoint is, in the first instance, a matter for the operator, the ESB, and I have no role or function in this regard. No specific cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken by my Department of the potential or otherwise of converting the plant to use biomass. However, there are a number of important issues that would need to be considered in this regard. The conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of capital investment by the operator. In recent weeks I have seen the figure of €300 million for the cost of conversion. Support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, which has been the most cost-effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, would also be required which could lead to increased electricity prices. Substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required, with large amounts of the resource having to be imported, leading to potential uncertainty in terms of security of supply. The sustainability of transporting large amounts of imported biomass would also be a cause for concern. The commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist. Before Moneypoint comes to the end of its operating life in its current configuration, in 2025, the most suitable replacement low-carbon generation technology will have to be identified.

While I accept that biomass has to be imported, so does coal, which will not be sustainable. No matter how one views this there will be cost implications. There could be cost implications if we do not meet our targets that we are perhaps not counting at the moment, such as fines. Would the ESB keep the Minister apprised of its thinking if it was doing a cost-benefit analysis? I presume it would. Does the Minister have any idea what it is thinking about for Moneypoint, given the amount that plant generates?

The White Paper will be published tomorrow but in the context of the transition we are embarked upon and that we must deliver to achieve a low carbon economy the fuel mix is an important policy question for the State and will have to be dealt with. Decisions will have to be made on Moneypoint within the next five years because it will come to the end of its current configuration in 2025. Moneypoint is well served by the grid. It is an important facility. I see a good future for it as a generator but the question is what to do if and when coal is phased out. The ESB could replace it with a new coal station and we would all have doubts about that. Some people advocate some carbon capture and sequestration for which there are new technologies. Would it be replaced with a gas-fired station or incorporate partial biomass? I do not exclude any of these possibilities but I listed the negative indicators that need to be addressed for conversion to biomass and the cost that would be visited on the consumer.

Some of the old generating stations attract subsidies. Presumably those subsidies would not apply if they use fuel that would lead to our paying a fine because that would be a double whammy. Has that been considered?

Decisions have been made about those subsidies. This will be a transition. It will not happen in one fell swoop because there are people whose livelihoods and jobs depend on many of these generating stations. We have to ensure that the transition also serves people who have worked for many years with these old technologies and show them the positive opportunities and potential that now exists in terms of embracing new technologies and renewable energy. There will be jobs and great potential for jobs and job creation in the renewable energy sector, not just in onshore wind but across the board. These issues are being actively addressed and are treated and elaborated in the White Paper, which will be published tomorrow.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	98	The renewable electricity feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for energy exported to the grid. Based on power purchase agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period. Projects seeking support under REFIT must apply to my Department by 4 p.m. on 31 December 2015. REFIT forms a key part of the public service obligation, PSO. The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers in Ireland to support national policy objectives related to renewable energy, indigenous fuels, peat, and security of energy supply. The PSO levy is determined each year by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  Ireland’s REFIT schemes have proved effective in attracting investment into the renewable energy sector. In addition, the REFIT schemes have been found to be a very cost-effective tool to support renewables development, as indicated by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators earlier this year. Furthermore, renewable electricity generation in Ireland in 2014 is estimated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to have avoided €250 million worth of fossil fuels imports.  My Department has been working with the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER to assess the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020.

Is this value for money? The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, states: "It is critically important for the effective functioning of the all island electricity market that renewable generation capacity is subject to market forces to the greatest extent possible. As a mature technology, price supports for new onshore wind projects should be discontinued when REFIT 2 ends in 2017". What is the Minister’s opinion of those statements? Does he believe we are over-reliant on wind energy to meet our commitments on carbon and so forth? 
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	100	The €156 million is the cost for overall renewable generation, not specifically wind. Of course it would be great if we could achieve our objectives without any State subsidy. It would be highly desirable not to have to subsidise the sector at all.However, it has been demonstrated that to bring forward the new renewable technologies and investments, that subsidy is required. Other countries have discovered this also. I have had this debate before about solar energy with one of the Deputy's colleagues. Strategic decision-making is always necessary in terms of the extent to which, and when, new technologies should be subsidised. Perhaps if one held back from the subsidy, as other countries in Europe are discovering in the case of solar energy, it might have happened anyway without it because the market would have delivered all of these changes. That may well be so, but, ultimately, we will review the question of wind energy. I do not want the Deputy to imagine that I think our renewable energy portfolio should be confined to onshore wind generation; it definitely should not. It has proved to be successful, but it should not be confined to it.

There are a raft of issues involved, with communities up in arms over it. Planners are now saying houses should not be built alongside wind turbines because such turbines are noisy and grant planning permission elsewhere. All things being considered, has the Minister factored what is happening in mainland Europe into his policy statement, the White Paper on energy? Given that many other countries are moving away from wind energy generation, should we not be doing likewise and look at alternatives such as solar energy? The Minister mentioned the regulator setting the PSO levy. Is he satisfied that the Commission for Energy Regulation has the correct legislative tools to carry out its job into the foreseeable future? The commission was founded ten years ago, but is it not time to re-examine the legislation governing it? It should have new powers, not alone to set prices but also to reduce them.

If it is determined or believed at any stage that the legislative environment is not adequate, of course, the Government can review it. If the Deputy has a view of a particular aspect of the legislation that he thinks is deficient, I am keen to hear what it is in order that we can debate the issue. However, I have no reason to believe the legislative environment in which the regulator is operating is problematic.  I keep hearing people say countries all over Europe are pulling away from wind energy generation, but that is simply not true. There are some countries which believe, understandably, that they have reached a certain level in onshore wind generation as a percentage or proportion of their renewables portfolio and that they do not need to, or cannot, go any further. I know that decisions have been made in the United Kingdom recently, but it is simply not true to say there is a generalised abandonment of onshore wind generation. I support the Government's onshore wind energy policy, but I remind the Deputy that the policy was put in place by the previous Government. It showed great foresight and I think we are right to carry it on.

Every time its representatives appear before the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources further serious concerns are raised about the independence of the study which the public very much regards as compromised.

I also acknowledge the work done by him and his constituency colleagues, Deputy Tony McLoughlin and Senator Michael Comiskey, who have had regular meetings with me to discuss this important matter. No doubt we will get into the Deputy's last question in a supplementary reply, but, first, I wish to respond to his initial question. I understand the contract for the unconventional gas exploration and extraction research programme was awarded following a robust evaluation process. The evaluation panel included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the six tenders received. The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by a broadly-based steering committee.  The evaluation panel found that the tender led by CDM Smith Ireland Limited provided the best response and a contract was awarded to the consortium in August 2014. The consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project's scope, as was detailed in the terms of reference. The project team was expected to include members with a comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology, as well as an in-depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socio-economic and technical issues, with a knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels. I am aware that there has been some comment on the fact that, internationally, CDM Smith has provided expert advice for oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. I should point out that it has also provided advice for State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common for a broad range of parties to seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.

The area most at risk from this pernicious technology is where my children and I live. It is where my grandchildren and great grandchildren will also live. Because I am not seeking re-election, I have the luxury of taking on this issue without political considerations. People are doing tremendous work in identifying weaknesses in the Government's approach. The EPA study is fundamentally and fatally flawed. It is one thing to say the EPA will recruit a firm with knowledge of the oil and gas industry but it is another when the company engaged to lead the project held an international symposium extolling the virtues of hydraulic fracturing. That was a bad choice and it will mean a bad study and a bad result. People will have zero confidence in the study which should be stopped.

It is also important to point out that this work was initiated in 2011 by the previous Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who wanted to find out what was best practice. There was consultation and the Deputy knows the history. Timeframes were set. I want to highlight a couple of important items. The first stage of the research programme is to conclude by the end of January 2016. It is a significant piece of work on the first phase. The plan was that, with work on the second phase, it would feed into a single report to be presented by July 2016.

It is important to point out that that is not going to happen within the timeframe set. As the tendering process for the second phase of the research programme has not commenced, there cannot be a final report by 2018. I will ask the steering committee to publish an interim report on the significant findings made at the end of January.

That is very wise. Will the interim report be placed before the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for its consideration before any decision is made? Will representatives of the EPA be brought before the joint committee again in advance of any decision being made on the second tender? I have tabled a motion to be taken at tomorrow's meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. The TTIP-ISDS negotiations are going on at the moment. The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications was not included as one of the committees involved in preparing the political contribution - as it is unfortunately called - report to the EU even though it covers functions that would be intimately and immediately impacted by TTIP-ISDS. Will that be taken into account following publication of the interim report?

Sticking to this question and this issue, making that presentation to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications will be considered. It is also important to point out that representatives of the EPA have appeared before the committee and made a very worthwhile presentation. The steering committee needs to be afforded space now because this question has just been asked publicly. I want to give it the space to produce an interim report on the significant body of work it has completed to date. That will happen. I am asking for that to be done sooner rather than later.

Many rural areas still have only 5 Mbps or 10 Mbps broadband. When will we see the physical roll-out of the rural broadband scheme? Will the Minister be absolutely clear on what speeds we can expect because it is inappropriate to talk about 30 Mbps, which is five years out of date?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	120	The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high-quality, high-speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. Last November, I published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at the broadband website. The areas marked blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services. The amber areas show the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the amber areas will be included in the State's intervention. The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. The high-speed map contains a breakdown of premises covered per townland. It is anticipated that there will be speeds of at least 30 Mbps. I emphasise that it is at least 30 Mbps because occasionally this is misreported or misunderstood as being up to 30 Mbps. It is not up to 30 Mbps but speeds of a minimum of 30 Mbps will also be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business. In other words, it will be future-proofed. Consumers can also consult the websites of the various commercial operators to ascertain details of current and future deployment plans.  Meanwhile, my Department continues to review the technical and financial detail relating to potential new commercial investment proposals. As I indicated earlier, I expect to proceed to formal procurement before the end of the year. The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within three to five years of the contract award. Some 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high-speed services by 2018 with 100% coverage by 2020.

At the end of it, he began to address the issues. He said that by the end of this year, he will have taken step 1. When can we expect to see the physical roll-out of high-speed broadband under the State's intervention? Will it be in 2016 or 2017? Does the Minister intend to roll out from the most isolated areas inwards - in other words, from those areas where there is no question of commercial intervention? Does the Minister agree that in reality within a year or two years, it will be 1 Gbps and that 30 Mbps is totally obsolete in the modern world? Even 100 Mbps has been overtaken. What most people will demand and get in the future is fibre to their premises.

The Deputy is correct. Given the exponential improvement in the technology and what is now possible, this sector is expanding and enhancing its services at a very high rate. What we expect of operators, and what we will do in the procurement process, is to understand from them how they will future-proof the network they will build in order to ensure it is not up to 30 Mbps but that 30 Mbps is the minimum and, as the technology improves, they will be able to upgrade the service they give to their consumers without building again, procuring again or anything else of that nature. It will start at 30 Mbps and go up from there. The Deputy is right that there is huge potential technology in regard to what can be achieved. That will be achieved and we will ensure we build future-proofing into the procurement process.

This is not step 1; this is step 3, as I have indicated. Step 1 was the publication of the map a year ago.

In other words, how long will the procurement process take? People want to know when they will be able to plug in their computers and get connected to proper broadband. Does the Minister not agree that if he wants to future-proof, he should specify 1 Gbps to everybody and be done with it? Specifying a minimum of 30 Mbps is obsolete already because what people need and expect is real high-speed broadband. The Minister knows how it is provided. It is a little bit of fibre in reality. Talking about being technology-neutral, real high-speed broadband cannot be provided other than by fibre.

I am not filled with confidence given the Minister of State's implacable defence of the process in the prepared answer he read out and then in the latter reply when he said he would give us an interim report, which completely contradicts the EPA head of research who in March of this year said there would be no interim reports.I do not know how the Minister of State can defend the EPA given that it has been broadly exposed in the eyes of a lot of people on this matter. The solution is that the process should be called off.

Instead of reading out the formal response I will take up the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. A decision was taken in 2011 to inform ourselves as policy agents and as legislators on the best thing to do on foot of the research and based on the best evidence available. I have taken a decision to approach the steering committee to produce an interim report. Deputy Clare Daly is correct that it was not part of the original thought process but it is important. The original timeframe was to have phases 1 and 2 completed by July 2016 and to dovetail them into a report in 2016. That is not going to happen. A tendering process has not been initiated for phase 2. In light of that, I am asking the steering committee to examine the significant body of evidence produced and to draw up an interim report and that will give us time to take stock of the information gathered. Deputy Clare Daly indicated in her question that 50% of research on fracking has been done since 2012 but we need to evaluate, take stock and produce an interim report to consider the information that has been garnered in the time afforded in the first instance.

We know, for example, that Queen's University pulled out at the start. We know that the Dáil was misled about the university's involvement in the process, having been told of its continued involvement in June 2015 when that was not the case. We know the role of CDM Smith Ireland, which was already highlighted in the previous question. In addition, we know that the peer-reviewed studies and information on this horrendous practice should lead us in the direction of saying "stop the runaway train", but from his response the Minister of State seems to say the EPA is independent - it has said it will not do an interim report but is ploughing on regardless - and that he will ask it to do a report. Does the Minister of State have the power to direct the EPA to do it? In light of existing evidence, why would he not just direct the EPA to stop because this does have the hallmark of becoming a runaway train? We know that the evidence produced since the terms of reference were written is that 69% of research on water quality found potential or actual contamination. Those are most serious issues and all of the peer-reviewed research says we should abandon fracking not just get an interim report.

It is important to point out that the information is garnered on a cross-Border basis. Some of those involved include the British Geological Survey, universities in Northern Ireland, UCD and the EPA. We have a collection of expertise and they form the steering committee. I will make formal contact with the steering group and ask it to produce a review. That will happen. I have spoken to the officials and indicated I would like that to happen sooner rather than later. A body of evidence is available from the information that has been garnered that will address my initial fears. When I got this post on the very first day I was answering a question asked by Deputy Colreavy and I put my reservations on the floor of the House. We are a small country and we have plenty of offshore capacity. We have had 42 expressions of interest for licences in terms of the Atlantic margin offshore. As to whether I have reservations about fracking, yes I do, and I want us to be clear and coherent in terms of getting the review and to take stock of the significant body of work that has been completed today, even though that was not part of the original terms of reference.

It seems to be a case of I have started so I will finish, which makes no sense. Let us be clear about the involvement of Queen's University. At the Oireachtas joint committee last week the EPA admitted that it had misled the House in regard to the major change in the status of the involvement of Queen's University in the process. It promoted Queen's University with the intention of beefing up the supposed independence of the research study. That is a fact. It is on the record. It is undisputed at this stage. Throwing more money at the process at this stage is very irresponsible, in particular when 88% of the studies done since the terms of reference were put in place found that air quality had elevated pollutant emissions and 84% of the original studies on health risks found signs of harm or indications of potential harm to human health and yet the latter is not being considered as part of the research. The biggest problem with fracking is not even being factored into the equation. It is an absolute disgrace that the programme is continuing. If the Minister of State is steering the ship he should just throw the anchor over and not even allow it to sail forward any further.

Significant work is being done so let us find out what has been evaluated and researched and then inform ourselves as legislators. As someone who lives in the north west and has plenty of contacts in south Donegal and Leitrim I have my own personal fears and concerns about the process. We are a small island with plenty of offshore capacity. In terms of geographical magnitude we are the fourth largest country in Europe when our sea area is taken into account. I acknowledge the legitimate concerns of people in this House and within the communities that could be affected. I have asked the steering committee to produce a mid-term review and to take stock of the findings we have in the first instance.

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility is essential to Irish consumers as we make this transition. By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels in line with the EU objective. By the end of the century in 2100 our greenhouse gas emissions will have fallen to zero or below. While fossil fuels will remain a progressively decreasing part of the energy mix as we transition to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, significant progress is already being made in increasing the share of renewables in that mix. Our immediate focus is on the period to 2020. In addition to the EU's 2020 targets for emissions reductions, the 2009 EU renewable energy directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, show that, in 2014, 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources. More specifically, the SEAI has calculated that 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport energy requirements were from renewable sources in 2014.

To what extent does he anticipate each of the alternative energy sectors will provide a growing amount of reliable energy without displacing food production in general? To what extent does he expect to be able to rely on a reduction in importation of all energy resources, particularly fossil fuels?

At the same time as replacing fossil fuels, and replacing dirtier fuels and fuel inputs, we are also reducing our dependence on imports. I can let the Deputy have some information on that. I gave some numbers to the House earlier in respect of 2014. This process will continue. The period to 2020 will be challenging but we were ahead in the energy area and I believe we can meet the 40% target in respect of electricity by 2020. It will be more difficult in the area of heat and more difficult again in the area of transport. I have responsibility for the energy sector but there will be challenges also in the agriculture sector and across the board.

It contains a discussion of the contribution that can be made by the different renewable sources. We have hydropower here but we do not have huge potential for its development in terms of large-scale projects. Onshore wind energy has proven to be very cost-effective but it is the not, and cannot be, the full story. Solar energy will have a big part to play, it is becoming cheaper all the time, and there are some very interesting and exciting developments in the area of storage which will make it easier progressively for us to expand our renewable energy portfolio. Biomass will certainly have a role to play, more likely in the heat sector than in the electricity generating sector. Offshore wind will have a role to play in the future; it is more expensive and is very much at the early stages of development. Many of these technologies need to mature and when they do I think they will come on board. Wave and tidal energies are also at early research phases. We will have a good discussion on this in the White Paper. We need to have a plan and we have a plan. We also need to decarbonise our economy and renewable energy is a huge part of that.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	152	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. This is not without its challenges, as I have said, particularly in the areas of heat and transport. The potential of the bioenergy sector to make a significant contribution in this regard is well recognised. I published a draft bioenergy plan in 2014 which was, in part, designed to capture this potential through the development and introduction of measures to encourage the growth of Ireland’s biomass and bioenergy sectors. One key demand-side measure identified in the plan was the introduction of a renewable heat incentive, RHI. Following analysis of various options, including increased carbon taxes, the option with the least modelled cost is an appropriately focused renewable heat incentive targeted at larger commercial and industrial heat users, at least in the first instance, and not at the domestic sector. As part of the process to design an effective RHI scheme, my Department published the first of three consultations in July this year to identify a range of technologies in the heating sector. Currently, all responses to this first consultation are under review. Two further consultations are expected in 2016 in order to finalise the new RHI support scheme subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  The current renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, 3 support scheme is designed to incentivise the use of biomass and bioenergy. This support scheme has already stimulated growth in the Irish biomass sector and the SEAI have reported that in 2014 the overall use of biomass grew by 13.2%. There is little doubt that shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable biomass and bioenergy more generally can help reduce overall emissions and tackle climate change.

It is clear that the contribution will be solely driven by the commercial sector and the large industrial users and it seems that those are the sectors the Department is targeting in terms of incentivising production. It is vitally important that we meet the heat targets set. The Minister pointed out that we are only reaching 6.6% of renewable energy production through the heat sector. We need to target domestic users. There are more than 2 million homes in this country, the vast majority of which are heated by fossil fuels - by oil and gas. If we are serious about achieving the targets and getting buy-in from the public in terms of tackling climate change and meeting our renewable energy targets, the Government needs to incentivise domestic users. There are organisations around the country, such as the Donegal woodland owners co-operative which are developing models and market streams for wood as a fuel for households, and they would benefit greatly from a domestic incentive that would encourage more farmers to go into the area of forestry, develop it and create jobs in the rural sector. It is vitally important for the Minister to encourage that.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	154	I appreciate what the Deputy said about the domestic sector. We have large industrial users in place in the country. We might not like many of these big operations and companies and so on but there is no point in us believing that we should not bring them into the picture and ensure that we incentivise them. I understood that was the point the Deputy was making with respect to a cut at the larger users and I apologise if that is not what he meant. He is right about the domestic sector in that we need to incentivise it. The analysis we carried out suggested that it would not be cost effective at this stage to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI scheme. This is due to a number of factors, including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems as well as the significantly greater cost associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector compared to the approximately 3,000 or so commercial and industrial installations envisaged for the scheme. However, there is much we can do in the domestic sector. Electricity has a role to play. Traditionally, we have shunned the idea of electric heat, for reasons that we all understand, in that we regard it as expensive and so on. There are many outstanding new developments happening in the sector where we can see that electricity can, in many ways, be the answer, or one of the answers, in the domestic environment.

I would argue as to whether they require an incentive because in drawing up their financial plans for the future they can see that there will be a return on it. However, domestic users would need an incentive not only in terms of meeting our targets but stimulating an industry across rural Ireland that could develop, grow and provide jobs. That is where the importance of providing a domestic incentive comes into the equation. The Government has decided that it will incentivise business and the business sector gets many incentives. It is time for the householder to get an incentive and for domestic renewable heat production to be incentivised.

In terms of the scale of what we are proposing and the analysis we have done in regard to the RHI, it would not be suitable at this point to direct the RHI scheme into the domestic sector. There will be much that we can do in the domestic sector. We will discuss this in the White Paper which is due to be published tomorrow. We will publish an affordable energy policy early in the new year. A huge amount of work has been done in that area in regard to energy efficiency. There is a massive amount that we can do in the domestic sector. I agree with the Deputy on that. It is just that this scheme may not be the most appropriate one to address the domestic sector, but biomass will definitely have a role to play.

This all-island programme of research, which is being administered by the EPA, comprises five interlinked projects and involves field studies as well as an extensive desk-based literature review of unconventional gas exploration and extraction practices and regulations worldwide. This scientific research programme considers existing baseline data with respect to groundwater, air and seismicity, and the potential implications and mitigations that are required to be considered to understand the environmental impacts of using this technology and whether it can be undertaken in an environmentally protective manner, in accordance with the requirements of environmental law. The programme has been designed to produce the scientific basis, which will assist regulators, North and South, in making an informed decision about whether it is environmentally safe to allow unconventional gas exploration and extraction. As well as research in Ireland, evidence from other countries will be collated and considered. As I have stated on a number of occasions, and I would like to once again confirm, no application to engage in such exploration and extraction has been received in my Department, nor would any such application, if submitted, be considered until the research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings. On the Paris summit, which the Deputy raised, any policy decision will be taken in the context of the objective of achieving a low carbon energy system by 2050.

That begs the question: what the hell is the report investigating? It is also extraordinary that on all the key environmental impacts that are being examined, CDM Smith and Amec Foster Wheeler - one an existing member, and the other a former member, of a pro-fracking coalition - are the lead forces in this study. It is hopelessly compromised by their relationship with the oil and gas industry. Is it not obvious that from a global climate and environmental point of view, fracking means producing more fossil fuels, which will do more damage to the environment and make it more difficult to meet climate change reduction targets and, therefore, if we want to be serious about contributing to preventing runaway climate change, fracking should be banned? The Government should forget all these useless compromise studies and just ban fracking.

This is shoddy to say the least in so far as the union gave considerable notice that it intended taking this industrial action but, unfortunately, it was not until the last minute that a compromise was arrived at. The Government parties have a habit of allowing situations to become totally chaotic before they take action. To add insult to injury, we learned today from The Irish Times that a shortfall of €100 million is identifiable in the HSE's service plan for 2016, which will inevitably result in a failure to treat thousands of people in hospitals and a failure to meet the treatment targets set down by the Minister for Health of 15 months for adults and 20 weeks for children. It has to be accepted that the Government has not been honest in its health budgeting over the past five years. It set targets knowing they could not be met. Waiting lists and waiting times have lengthened and overcrowding in accident and emergency departments has gone from crisis to chaos.

Does the Taoiseach agree with Mr. O'Brien that there is no money, no plan or no vision?When the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, says he concurs with many of the valid points made by Mr. O'Brien, some of which the Minister has also made, is he referring to this key element of the lack of vision, money and a plan?

I am glad the INMO has reached an agreement with HSE management to call off the strike. As was pointed out by the Minister for Health on a number of occasions, strike action would not deal with a single person on a trolley anywhere. It was not the Government that called the strike in the first place and I am glad the negotiations have resulted in the strike not taking place. I point out to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that the number of people on trolleys this morning at 8 a.m. was 290, which is down 33% on this day in 2014. It is still too many but very much down. The Government recognises that working in emergency departments can be a very trying and difficult job. Recruiting and retaining staff is always a challenge. I hope the nurses and unions will vote in favour of the package agreed at the Workplace Relations Commission and that the planned action for Tuesday, 12 and Wednesday, 13 January will not arise. It is very unfortunate that this planned action resulted in the deferral of elective procedures in the hospitals concerned and that people waiting to undergo procedures today will have to go through the process again. I do not accept that money is not being put into the health service plan. Over €13 billion has been put into it this year, which is an increase of over €800 million. I point out to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that the service plan will be published tomorrow and the Minister has made it clear there is no diminution in any service and that there are targeted increases in services in a number of areas. That is for the good of the patient and for the benefit of the health service in general.  The question of work practices is always an issue in hospitals and the discussions surrounding that are of concern for nurses who work at the front line, doctors and management. The answer to the Deputy's question is that there is more money in there than before. There is no requirement for any diminution in service, instead services will be maintained and there will be targeted increases in a number of areas. The longer term vision is to end the two-tier system and introduce a single tier system, accessible to everybody and based on medical requirements rather than income.

He had a plan and made a promise to introduce universal health insurance which was abandoned last month by the Government. He got rid of the National Treatment Purchase Fund which was working effectively. The Taoiseach has agreed a plan to deal with the situation in emergency departments. It is clear that it will add to waiting times for those waiting for elective procedures. There are 16,000 people waiting for colonoscopies across the country, 3,700 of whom have been waiting more than six months. That is a totally unacceptable situation. At the weekend, the CEO of the health executive said there was no plan, vision or money in the context of the sort of multi-annual budgeting that the National Health Service in Britain has. It is an appalling indictment of the health service that the Taoiseach and his Government are operating. In 2013, we were briefed that the Taoiseach was going to personally take charge of the health service, he was going to grab it by the scruff of the neck. Does the Taoiseach accept that he, his two Ministers for Health and his Government have failed the Irish people and have been an abject failure when it comes to delivering to the Irish people the calibre of service they require?

We had a plan to establish hospital groups, which we have established. We had a plan to put primary care centres in situ and there are now 46 more centres around the country than in 2011. We had a plan to provide those under the age of six with free GP cards, which has been implemented. We had a plan to provide over-70s with free GP cards and that is being implemented. The next step is to introduce cards for under-12s. We had a plan to increase staff in our health service. Almost 300 additional consultants have been appointed since 2011 and since January 2015 more than 750 nurses and 250 non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited, which is also part of the plan. We had a plan to put money into the mental health services, which the Deputy's party never bothered with, and we trebled mental health funding and provided a suicide prevention strategy which aims to reduce suicide by 10% by 2020. We stabilised private health insurance. Fianna Fáil put the HSE together on top of all the health boards. The result was described by the chief executive as an amorphous blob - the Deputy's party created an amorphous blob.

Despite the Deputy's comments, it will maintain services and provide increased services in a targeted number of areas.

On Friday, I visited Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim and Cortober in County Roscommon to witness the devastating effects of the Shannon floods on homes and businesses. I met with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, local hoteliers, shopkeepers, publicans, householders and visited a number of local businesses. I commend all of those people, including the local council, who made a huge effort to put up sand bag defences and other preventative measures. One man whose business, the cineplex, has been closed as a result of the floods pays €23,500 yearly in rates and provides much needed local jobs. He cannot obtain flood insurance, neither can other business, many of which are also closed. I met with residents from St. Patrick's Park who are penned in by flood water. The people I met are deeply upset by the lack of strategic planning by the Government on a problem which they say is entirely predictable and preventable. Some of the issues raised with me include the urgent need to fast-track the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme. The need for consultation with local people who have knowledge and expertise of flood patterns is a critical and often neglected part of this. They raised the abolition of the regional drainage boards which means the responsibility for cleaning Shannon tributaries is now left to underfunded local councils, which has resulted in an absence of sustainable draining systems. Despite various appeals, the Government has refused to allocate funds for land drainage schemes in the Shannon regions which should include the utilisation of callow and natural floodplains. No single agency is responsible for the management of the River Shannon. Will the Taoiseach give full responsibility to the OPW for management of the Shannon? Will he establish a State-funded insurance scheme for households and businesses that are affected by flooding and cannot get flood insurance, which they have not been able to get for some time?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	182	With all the people Deputy Adams met in Carrick-on-Shannon, it looked to me as though he was canvassing but I understand that is not the case. In any event, it does not take from the stress and pressure on people in private houses or businesses when floodwaters come.Last week the Government reactivated the €10 million humanitarian fund for private house owners. It is now available through the community welfare office system. The Government has also put together a €5 million compensation fund for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The requirements in terms of access to this funding are that the dates during which the premises were flooded and the rateable valuation of the property must be authenticated by a local authority engineer. An initial sum of €5,000 can be sought and paid before Christmas, with the opportunity, if the flooding is really bad, to claim a further €15,000 in compensation duly authenticated and validated by way of invoices and so on. That is the immediate response. I agree with Deputy Gerry Adams's remarks on the services and volunteers who have slaved day and night. I saw first hand, during a visit last Sunday to Foxford, Ballina and Crossmolina, the full impact of the flood waters.  The Deputy's proposal regarding a single authority for the River Shannon has been around for many years. It is not possible to do it, given that statutory authority for the River Shannon rests with a number of bodies, including the ESB, the OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and many fisheries, tourism, commercial and local authority interests. While the proposal may sound wonderful, in public discussion the co-ordination required has thus far proved to be exceptionally difficult. I agree with the Deputy that the Shannon is a slow moving river and that it drains 40% of the country. The implications for people living below the Parteen weir in terms of the efforts being made to minimise flood damage speak for themselves. The Government has set out a ten-year strategy. There are 300 locations included in the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, in respect of which flood defences need to be provided, 66 of which are located along the River Shannon. While there is no single authority with responsibility for it, it will be possible to identify under the CFRAM programme which authority bears responsibility and what should be done, bearing in mind that in some instances there will be an overlap of responsibility between authorities.  The arterial drainage programme of the 1950s and late 1960s is finished. There is no longer a need for arterial drainage. The system was put in place for agricultural purposes, based on three to five year projections. Flood defences are supposed to last 100 years. I refer the Deputy to what happened in Carlisle where almost €40 million was spent on flood defences that did not work. It is important, therefore, that we get it right. I commend the practicality of the OPW, for instance, in Clonmel where it raised the barriers under the flood relief scheme, which has proved very successful. I sympathise with people on the damage done to their houses and businesses. The Government has, at least, responded quickly by providing some immediate relief. The longer-term plan, under which almost €500 million be spent in the next six years on the putting in place of, I hope, flood defences that will address any future issue, is being drawn up by the OPW.

Surely, that is what we are here for. We are paid to enact legislation in that regard if it is the right way forward. It is possible if there is the political will. The problem is that successive Governments, rather than being proactive or strategic, have been reactive. The Taoiseach has mentioned that a €10 million humanitarian fund and another emergency fund of €5 million have been provided. However, as a result of cuts to the OPW's flood risk management programme, flood relief has been reduced by €15.6 million, which means what the Government is giving by way of the funds mentioned amounts to only €6,000. As a result of climate change, extreme weather events will get worse. Events which may have occurred only every 30 or 40 years will now happen every five years. The Government needs to face up to this and plan for it in a strategic way. Many of us have seen first hand the serious problems with which people have to deal. God help those who year in, year out have had to bail out water from their homes, cannot get insurance and whose possessions have been destroyed as they face into Christmas.  In February 2014 I visited Limerick after a severe flooding event, following which I raised these same issues with the Taoiseach.

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is happy to blame the insurance industry for its refusal to provide flood cover. As the Taoiseach did not answer the following question, I will put it to him again. Will he, first, reverse the cut to the OPW's flood risk management programme and, second and most important, will he bring forward proposals for a State-funded flood insurance scheme? The second proposal is crucial for folks.

On his point that if there was the will, we could have a single authority, the process of putting in place such an authority would, in practice, be lengthy in terms of visits to the courts on the definition of responsibility and what statutory authority meant. Those whose homes and businesses are flooded cannot wait because the river continues to rise and the current defences are inadequate. The Deputy has seen the pictures of the thousands of acres of areas under water. While some flexibility is provided for in the farming sector in terms of the movement of animals, flooded slurry pits and so on, the main issue concerns how we are going to deal with the flooded areas in a pragmatic fashion. I noted when travelling home last weekend that many of the areas flooded were areas that had always been subject to flooding during the 40 years I had been travelling to and from Dublin. It happens in the winter time. The difference is that there are now buildings and houses in places where they should not be.

The OPW is working on seven schemes in areas such as Ennis, Fermoy and Bray and on the River Dodder. In 2016 work on a further five schemes, two of which will be in Claregalway and Bandon, will commence. The OPW is at various stages of planning of a further 22 projects, including one in Crossmolina which was flooded last week. By mid-2016 the OPW hopes to have a feasible solution in place for the 300 areas at risk of flooding. As I said, in this regard the Government is providing €1 billion in the next ten years, €460 million of which will be provided in the next five or six years, which is more money than has been ever spent in the past.

On insurance for houses, we will look at the issue. I want to make it clear that the Government has no intention of putting further levies on householders for insurance cover. The scheme in England excluded houses built after 2009 and small businesses. That is not a model that would work here. There is a memorandum of understanding between the insurance companies and the OPW. They share information of a commercial nature which is then factored into insurance assessments. A great deal of work is ongoing. I reiterate my thanks to all concerned for their support and hope the waters will not rise to a point where houses will be flooded further.

In the past week I attended two meetings with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the drawing up of new maps, which process I have discovered to my horror is not being carried out in local offices, which is rather unusual. I welcome the €5 million compensation fund for small businesses. The Taoiseach will probably have seen for himself the many family farms, slatted sheds and fodder damaged by flooding. Septic tanks, on which people had to pay a €5 levy following the introduction of legislation in January 2011, have also been damaged. I have learned in the past few days that the cost of repairs to damaged septic tanks which are registered but outside the 5% required to be inspected annually will not be met by the council or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The people concerned who abided by the law introduced by the Government in 2011 will have to meet the cost of repairs to their septic tanks, only because they are not included in the 5% of septic tanks required to be inspected annually under EU law. Will the Taoiseach clarify if a family farm which is affected, whether it is its slatted shed or fodder, is considered a business? I class family farms across the country as businesses run by farmers. Will the Taoiseach put one person or body in charge? There are currently 17 bodies looking after the Shannon. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is sitting next to the Taoiseach. We have the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland. Each organisation is blocking the other and the OPW, with the best will in the world, is going around in circles. It is trying to play happy families with everyone but it is being blocked. For once and for all, can we take the bull by the horns? Will one body with the authority to carry out relief works for flooding, dredging or whatever, without every obstacle possible being put in its way, be made responsible for the rivers? Will family farms receive payment under the SME scheme? Given the septic tank legislation, will a payment be made to those who are not in the 5% category? Currently they are being refused even though they complied with the law.

This includes all 11,500 km of channel, 700 km of various embankments and associated scheme bridges, sluices, weirs, pumping stations and so on. Deputy Fitzmaurice is well aware that the suitably equipped hydraulic equipment does not gouge out new channels but removes, where maintenance is carried out, silted-up areas and sediment that becomes lodged due to currents in rivers. It is obvious that farming is a business. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department recognise that fact, which is why particular flexibility has been shown in respect of the agrisector in this regard. Deputy Fitzmaurice knows that farmers are the first to come to each other's rescue. All over the country, where farmers get into trouble, their neighbours and community come to assist in terms of fodder, moving of animals and other issues such as flooded houses. The Deputy knows from his previous existence the difficulties that can arise when one gets tangled with a Department or State authority. I am not saying that to the Deputy's detriment as he is entitled to his opinion. However, when one multiplies it by a plethora of statutory authorities, the important point is that the Office of Public Works, instead of glad-handling everyone, as described by Deputy Fitzmaurice, has identified 300 areas, 66 of which are on the Shannon. It will identify who is responsible and who should carry out the works required. This might be more effective than hoping to find a single entity, which would take years in court hearings and legal challenges from one statutory authority to another, some of which have been around since before the State was founded. The situation is not as simple as is suggested. The problem is that rivers rise when rainfall increases and the Shannon is a slow river-riser in that sense. People are now in dread of bad weather over the next week or so and I hope it does not happen, but there is a serious ongoing programme in place.  Deputy Fitzmaurice will also appreciate that when flood defences have to go into Athlone, Galway, Ennis, Fermoy or elsewhere, they have to be done right. There is no point in putting up something that is haphazard or ill-thought out. The hydrological surveys will also have to have been carried out. I accept that many older people have great experience of drainage patterns and that experience should be called into account when the Office of Public Works or anyone else looks at land or tributaries that should be drained. Older people and farmers will say that for 50 years an area did or did not flood. In so many cases, commercial developers said they knew how to drain an area but that is not how it turned out. All that experience should, in our common interest, be used and applied.

It is clear that many agricultural farms are located outside the areas defined by the Office of Public Works as being flood plains. The requirement in respect of septic tanks was to register the tanks for €5. Registration under the scheme was costed by some on the opposite side of the House at €20,000, which was not the case. The intention was that, in respect of sediment and effluent coming from septic tanks that were not working properly, the tanks would be assessed on an interim basis-----

Over the past 12 months we have probably heard more about rural crime than we have ever heard before although an analysis of the figures shows that crime is a problem in our urban areas as well. It is good to hear the Taoiseach proposes to convene a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to look at the Garda Inspectorate report. The report throws up hugely significant issues which go to the heart of our decades old policing system. The issues are implicitly critical of the current and previous justice Ministers, including justice Ministers from my party, in so far as they presided over a bureaucratisation of the policing service.The public, to some extent, is way ahead of politicians in terms of how it views the policing service. If one talks to people in Mayo, Kildare or Dublin, one will hear that they want gardaí to be highly visible on their streets, housing estates and country roads. If there is an incident in their home or business, they want to be sure that when they lift the phone there will be an expeditious response from gardaí. The reality is, however, that we have allowed a system to develop whereby large numbers of gardaí are tied down by office duties, bureaucracy, court attendances and a multitude of other duties, many of which could be taken on by civilian staff, thereby allowing gardaí to go back on the beat, to work in communities and to be more visible than they have been in recent years. The Garda Inspectorate in its recent report estimated that 1,500 gardaí could be freed up for this type of duty, with 250 identifiable straight away. In that context, the report is making a point with which many members of the public would concur. Does the Taoiseach envisage the Cabinet sub-committee on justice addressing this particular issue and being in a position to do something about it?  A report on recidivism published by the CSO in recent days highlighted a recurring problem with young male offenders in particular, who return again and again to a life of crime. It is quite clear these people are not gaining anything from their incarceration within the prison system, albeit that there is a training and education service available to them. It must be noted that our prison service is particularly expensive. It costs in the order of €70,000 per annum to incarcerate a prisoner. Many of those who have become involved in a life of crime can be identified at a very early stage in life. Those involved in the education system, for example, are able to identify, at a very early age, children who are at risk of ending up in prison later on and yet we have not been investing as a State in the early intervention that is needed. The home school liaison programme, the school completion programme and guidance counselling have all been negatively impacted by cuts made by this Government and previous Governments.

We were told that this would allow greater flexibility and that gardaí would be more visible, active and high profile but in reality, that has not happened. One also wonders what is happening with those 139 stations. The buildings were all of some importance in their local communities. In Kildare, for example, we saw three Garda stations close and I heard a debate on local radio this morning about one such station in the village of Ballitore. The local community has asked that the building be made available to be used as a community facility. Are these the types of issues that can be discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee on justice? Can the Taoiseach envisage the Government giving an instruction to the Garda authorities, the OPW or whatever body is responsible to bring these buildings back into use? Given the current housing crisis, some might provide suitable accommodation to those in need of housing while others might be usefully converted into community centres. Finally, I wish to refer to the drugs problem, which the Taoiseach must accept is at crisis point in both rural and urban areas. Often when we speak about drugs, we talk about our cities and large towns but we all know that the drugs problem is afflicting every town and village in rural Ireland. I recently visited a small housing estate of about 40 houses in my constituency. There are three heroin addicts living in the estate which is causing all manner of anti-social behaviour connected with the sale of drugs. Dealers are trekking in and out of the estate, selling drugs and trying to recruit others into addiction. There is a host of issues on the justice agenda. Will the Taoiseach give us some indication that they will be tackled in the period ahead? I would like to see the Cabinet sub-committee on justice meeting on a more regular basis so that the recommendations in the report from the Garda Inspectorate and the findings of the report on the prison service could be acted on.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	212	Crime is an issue for everybody and is always of concern. I agree that it is important that gardaí are visible in local areas. Following a period of economic constraint, things have begun to move in a more positive direction. The Garda training college in Templemore has reopened, with 600 recruits due to go through next year. These new recruits come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked in different jobs for a number of years while others are married with families. Garda recruitment used to be confined to the younger age cohort but that is no longer the case. This gives us a better mix of people wishing to serve in An Garda Síochána. The issue of gardaí on the beat is important. People love to see gardaí in their communities, on bicycles or walking around. This is part and parcel of good connection with the community. Why would we train gardaí and remunerate them to do their job if they end up walking through communities, not knowing who people are? That kind of connection and communication is really important for gardaí and I am very glad to see that it is now happening all over the country. I know of one location where gardaí will drive their car to point X and then walk around within a couple of miles of that point. They call to all of the houses in the area, identify themselves and obtain information on family members and so forth.  I will deal with the Garda Inspectorate report presently but as Deputy Ó Fearghaíl knows, the Government set about putting in place an independent policing authority which represents the single greatest shake up in An Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State. The legislation provides for the appointment of a new policing authority to oversee the police functions of An Garda Síochána and has been dealt with. The consultations that took place were very extensive and were generally in line with the general scheme of the Bill which was published in November 2014. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality considered the general scheme in the course of the pre-legislative scrutiny process and broadly welcomed its proposals. Following its legal establishment, which the Government signed off on today, Ms Josephine Feehily, former chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, will be the chairperson of the new policing authority. The Minister for Justice and Equality is making arrangements for the eight ordinary members of the authority to be appointed and they will also be designated on an interim basis. These posts were advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS. A total of 97 applications for the eight positions were received. The PAS interviewed all applicants and then put forward 17 names for consideration. The PAS has also run an open competition to fill the positions of chief executive and head of legal and governance affairs for the authority and those appointments will be announced shortly. It will take effect on 1 January. The Garda Inspectorate's report is to be considered by the committee very shortly. At that meeting I expect to see both the Garda Commissioner and the head of the governance authority, Mr. Olsen. There are issues in the report that need to be teased out and talked about openly and frankly and on which one hopes we can have clarity and agreement about the structure and the strategy.  When I read a report that states there is a lack of confidence and trust among civilians working in the justice system, I want to know if this is true. From my experience of local Garda stations in different places around the country, that is not the case. They work very well with inspectors, superintendents and chief superintendents, as the case may be. Civilians who have been properly trained free Garda personnel who have been trained to do a different job, an issue raised by Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl. There is the question of how the amalgamation of districts would work. Within the Garda, from the Commissioner down, there is openness and a willingness to engage in the interests of the community and the job gardaí have to do, which, as we all know, can be fatal and difficult in many circumstances. The committee would like to engage with Mr. Olsen and the Garda Commissioner to follow through on these issues. Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl raised the question of Garda station closures. Yesterday I attended a meeting with the chief superintendent for the western region which includes counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath, as well as with all of the chief Garda personnel and the Minister for Justice and Equality. It was a very open and frank discussion. Where rural Garda stations were closed, many of the buildings were more than 100 years old and not even acceptable to the local community. The important point is that while the station might close, gardaí will still be in situ in the community. However, rather than sitting there for two hours on a Tuesday or a Friday waiting for unemployment assistance forms to be signed, gardaí have the capacity to move through the community to call on older people to give out their cards and so on. In addition, gardaí made the point that superintendents, the real powerhouse in the system, together with inspectors and sergeants, attended community councils on a regular basis to talk to them and ask what the issues were. It is a point of fact that the incidence of burglaries and crime in the west has fallen, the result of greater visibility in the community. It is also a fact that the Government, with meagre resources which are getting a little stronger, was able to provide vehicles and proper equipment for gardaí and put €200 million on the table for proper IT equipment in order that the TETRA system would work everywhere and the new communications systems would allow gardaí to be available and receive information from communities at first hand. I recently attended a security presentation by gardaí on the supply of different equipment for houses. A well concentrated and well resourced community text alert scheme is very important in any community in order that information on person or vehicle X or Y can be communicated and responded to very quickly by a community which is alert and vigilant. From what I heard yesterday from chief superintendents, superintendents and inspectors, the engagement of gardaí with communities is up-front, which is to be commended. That is another matter about which we would like to talk to the Garda Inspectorate in the context of putting together a structure fit for the 21st century, in particular the next ten, 15 or 20 years. I said to the Garda members that it was not just about looking at the next two or five years but about the kind of Garda force we wanted to see in ten or 20 years to ensure it would be capable of meeting the new demands in dealing with criminality, drugs, burglaries and so on. Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl referred to burglaries. Operation Thor which has been introduced and provided for has been of great benefit to gardaí who have actually been calling to the houses of criminals who have been convicted and released on bail and, if they are not available or not adhering to their bail conditions, are in difficulty. Obviously, it is a multi-strand anti-crime campaign being conducted by the Garda. It has been in planning for several months and was launched as a follow-on to recent announcements of investment in policing and to coincide with the advent of the long winter nights, which is always a cause of concern. It includes a range of activities to deal with burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders. I heard about one offender, a drug addict who had committed five or six burglaries, who had been put away having been apprehended because of the capacity of Operation Thor. The measures include high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot spots. It is not true to say all burglars come from one area of the country. There are also, if one likes, home-grown individuals who get involved in burglaries in their own regions. It is important that communities be aware of this and transmit information quickly to the Garda. High-powered vehicles have been provided for gardaí and there are the new regional response units. I was very glad to hear the chief superintendent talk about the exceptional driving courses for gardaí in order that they would be at a standard much higher than that of the normal driver. There have been efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market and programmes to help reduce the level of reoffending by prolific offenders. A high-powered national crime awareness campaign is also under way. All of these measures are important. Some €34 million has been invested in Garda vehicles since 2012. Some 640 new vans, cars and jeeps have become available this year, including some high-powered vehicles for armed Garda units. There has been important investment in airborne surveillance under the capital programme for 2016 to 2021. Gardaí are, therefore, being equipped with the best technology and information systems. Some €205 million is to be spent over the lifetime of the plan. This will give the Garda greater capacity to respond to this activity, about which we are as concerned as communities. The moratorium on the recruitment of gardaí has been ended. Some 550 gardaí have been taken in and a further 600 will commence training next year, all of whom are young people.  The Garda works well with the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tíre and other community organisations. It is involved with alert programmes, in the ongoing work of the metal theft forum, the Crimestoppers campaign, the highlighting of the theft of livestock and animals, the new TheftStop initiative in respect of farm equipment and, of course, the highly successful Garda text alert schemes. These are some of the things that are being done.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	213	First, let me extend best wishes to the newly appointed chairman of the Policing Authority and its soon to be appointed members. However, I also express my concern that the new authority will not be truly as independent as it might be. I welcome the Taoiseach's indication that the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform will consider the Garda Inspectorate's report.That report, Changing Policing in Ireland, is another wake-up call for the Government on the problems of policing in the State. It has concluded that An Garda Síochána is top heavy, inefficient, defensive, bureaucratic and resistant to change. Ten years ago the Dáil passed legislation requiring the establishment of a Garda code of ethics, but that code remains in draft form. It might be useful to discover whether the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform has discussed this issue. In recent years the Garda Inspectorate has made 11 recommendations on operational supervision, but only two have been implemented. Again, it might be useful to discover whether this issue was discussed by the Cabinet sub-committee. The new report proposes 81 changes and each recommendation is given a timeline to be implemented. We are told many of these changes could be delivered on a low or no cost basis. It is obvious reform is needed and the report's recommendations appear to be common sense. The inspectorate has also concluded that when resources are cut, front-line policing is adversely affected. A series of public meetings have been held, mostly in rural Ireland, on the impact of burglaries and theft on farms. There has been a huge public response to these meetings, nowhere more so than in County Louth where two brave gardaí, Adrian Donohoe and Tony Golden, were recently murdered. At a meeting I attended in Ballymascanlon the issues affecting people were raised. They included fuel laundering and the dumping of toxic sludge, but burglaries and the theft of farm machinery and livestock were particular issues. There is huge anger at the lack of Garda patrols and the closure or reduced opening hours of Garda stations. This is a particular issue in Border regions because criminals use both the motorway network and the Border to make their escape. Following the murder of Garda Tony Golden, additional Garda resources have been allocated in County Louth. This has had an immediate effect and I welcome the arms find in Jenkinstown. The move has also had the effect of disrupting criminal behaviour in the region. However, the additional resources are only temporary and have been provided from the resources provided for counties Cavan and Monaghan. Therefore, the gain for the community in north Louth following the killing of Garda Tony Golden represents a loss for counties Cavan and Monaghan. In a previous discussion on the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform here I suggested the new Garda authority should go into neighbourhoods and communities to listen to citizens as a means of building confidence. I know from experience in the North that the Patten process did this and that it played a crucial part in winning support for policing proposals and a two-way understanding of policing with the community and the community's responsibility to support the police. When I raised this issue previously, the Taoiseach said it seemed to be a good idea and that it would be discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee. Will he report back on what happened?  The 2007 inspectorate report recommended the devolution of greater autonomy to Garda regions, but that has not happened. There was particular concern at the time about the provision of front-line services. I note that front-line services have been undermined because of cuts made. The idea of policing with the community is at the core of the report and part of the mission statement of An Garda Síochána. However, we do not have enough community gardaí. Of the 540 community gardaí assigned across the State, some 328 are in the six Dublin metropolitan regions. It is good that they are there and to be welcomed, but rural communities do not have a proportionate number of community gardaí and some have none at all. In one third of the State there are no full-time community gardaí, while in 14 rural divisions there are ten or fewer.  The report has also found that too many fully trained gardaí are sitting behind desks. It suggests at least 1,500 and possibly up to 2,000 fully trained gardaí, at least 500 of whom are in Garda headquarters, could be taken out of offices to police the State.  This is a comprehensive document and I commend the members of the inspectorate for their efforts. The big test is whether the Government and An Garda Síochána will implement the recommendations made. Also, when the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform has had an opportunity to discuss the report, will the Taoiseach report back to the Dáil on its deliberations?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	214	I will be very happy to do so and the Dáil shall have an opportunity to discuss the report also, as it is of interest to everybody. The new Garda authority represents a radical break from what has applied for 80 or 90 years because it will be tasked with overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner in a wide range of policing services. It will also develop a key role in the future appointment of senior Garda management. It will have to approve a three-year strategy statement and the annual policing plan that are to be submitted to it by the Garda Commissioner. Also, within 12 months, it will establish and publish a code of ethics that will include standards of conduct and practice for members of An Garda Síochána. Over and above this, it will hold a quarterly meeting in public to engage with the community. In addition, the authority will be enabled to request the Garda Ombudsman, GSOC, to investigate any policing matter that gives rise to a concern that a member of An Garda Síochána may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. It may also request GSOC, subject to the consent of the Minister, to investigate any behaviour of the Garda Commissioner in the context of his or her functions in policing matters. It may request GSOC to examine practices or procedures in An Garda Síochána in a policing matter and can request the Garda Inspectorate to initiate an inspection or inquiry into aspects of the operation or administration of An Garda Síochána in so far as they pertain to policing powers. The question is often asked as to whether the Policing Authority will have real powers. The answer to that question is yes, it will. It will have the power to hold the Garda to account, with senior Garda management reporting to the authority, including at public meetings. It will determine Garda priorities in policing services and nominate persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner. It will appoint persons to the rank of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner and be responsible for removing them for reasons related to policing services. It will also appoint persons to senior positions within Garda civilian staff. These are all important powers that the new, independent Policing Authority will have. These proposals have been prepared in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure they are entirely constitutional and take into account the full remit of the Constitution. In particular, consideration has been given to Article 28.Under Article 28, as interpreted by the courts, there are restrictions on the extent to which it is open to the Government to delegate important functions relating to the Executive power of the State to another body. Overall, the proposals for the policing authority are designed to strike the right balance between on the one hand, the exercise by the authority of effective and meaningful oversight of the policing functions of An Garda Síochána and on the other hand, the retention by the Government of essential residual powers in policing in accordance with what is appropriate under Article 28. It took a deal of discussion and clarity before that could happen. An important issue to be dealt with in the Bill is national security, a vital component of government. The Garda Commissioner of the day will continue to account fully to the Minister and to the Government on security matters. The question was asked as to whether the Garda Commissioner will account to the policing authority on national security issues and the answer is "No". As national security is a vital function of government, it is proposed that under the new oversight arrangements, the Garda Commissioner will report to the policing authority in respect of policing matters and to the Minister for Justice and Equality with regard to security matters. These are important and serious areas of evolution for the new Garda authority. As Deputy Adams rightly points out, the Garda Inspectorate report makes 81 recommendations and is 380 pages long. Five headings of the recommendations are under structure, operational deployment practices, enabling organisational change, effective use of human resources and financial, information technology and other resource practices. Some of the key recommendations include, for example, changing the organisational structure to one that is leaner at senior management level, providing more gardaí for front-line duties. There is an idea that more gardaí could be released for front-line duties if we provided for further civilianisation, and this goes back to my response to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's question. What is the level of trust and confidence between the structure and those who work as civilians in the system? Personally, I find they appear to work very well but the report indicates that this is not the case in some instances. That issue needs to be addressed. It also indicates that the number of Garda regions should be reduced from six to three. That could be a difficult cultural issue to accept. There is some residual evidence to suggest that where it was attempted to amalgamate regions or districts, there was still adherence to the old district boundaries, and those districts that were amalgamated might not be as effective as they should be. Perhaps it takes a period for that culture to become fully understood. There is a recommendation about the possibility of over 1,000 or 1,500 fully trained and experienced gardaí going on front-line duties. The same thing might apply in a different sector, with members of the nursing profession graduating after having done courses X and Y. When they get promotion, they might not be involved with direct nursing, for which they were trained, and they could instead be on administrative duties. There are a number of recommendations in this designed to improve accountability, leadership and supervision. There is a requirement to develop a new divisional policing model that would put communities first and more gardaí on the front line. That will probably be reflected in the report to be brought forward shortly by the Garda Commissioner. She will present a report to the Minister on changing structure for the running of An Garda Síochána. That will be an important consideration from the Commissioner's perspective. I hope the engagement between the inspectorate, the Commissioner and the Cabinet sub-committee will yield beneficial results. There has always been a question about rosters and whether there is more or less time to be able to deal with these issues. It all points in the direction of having a strong economy that can provide the resources to deal with justice and policing issues in the time ahead. That is all the more reason it is important that the recovery under way would be maintained in a competent and progressive fashion, so the strength of the economy can be released to deal with these issues, whether they relate to education, health, policing or defence, etc. We live in a very different world than we used to and it is all moving at a very fast speed. Our gardaí need to be properly resourced and have all the facilities. They need upskilling or training and they need communication systems that will be fit for purpose. The structure, which is the subject of a major report, should be looked at and discussed openly and frankly in the interests of having it lean, effective, professional, competent and forward-looking. As the Deputy states, it should engage with the community. It is always the fact that when people telephone the gardaí, it is a question of who they know or who they will call. Is there a number and is it manned? Will there be a response? In the recent fortnight, people in the communities have come out day and night to help their neighbours. There is an enormous willingness to participate in the proper running of our country. There are text alert schemes and engagement by superintendents and the inspectorate with the community councils and civilians. People talk about the issues in the past month, the provision of closed-circuit television cameras or how people can be vigilant about what goes on in communities, whether urban or rural. This is all in everybody's interest. There is a fear of burglary and other crime that sends older people to bed at night very frightened, and clearly we do not want that. There is a changing nature to burglaries, with farm equipment and livestock being targeted. Farms have been open to everybody over the years but that has now changed. There is confiscation or disruption of materials, including metals, from farms and isolated units. This is part and parcel of the challenge of the world in which we now live. GPS locators can be attached to equipment and material and if one is lucky enough, one might find out to where something is gone. I assume we will have an engagement and the report will be back here so we can have the Dáil discuss it and people can give their views. It will be a useful engagement and I look forward to hearing how the inspectorate will present its report, how the Garda Commissioner will respond and how the political and departmental representatives on the committee reflect on it. It is all in the interests of having a proper structure that is fit for purpose.

First, there is the case of Ibrahim Halawa. The Taoiseach knows that today his trial has for the umpteenth time been postponed. It will now take place at the end of the month. From a justice perspective, we need to publicly say that the process of so-called justice that is being applied to Ibrahim Halawa is an utter sham. He is essentially the victim of a political show trial by a regime that has discarded any interest in the human rights of its own citizens or, in this case, one of our citizens. It is engaged in using a sham judicial process to eliminate and terrorise political opponents. In this case, it is one of our own citizens who got caught up in nothing more than a protest.It begs the question of why we are not being more robust in terms of calling out this injustice. The Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform needs to see it in those terms.

In particular, has the committee considered, or will it consider, the ongoing call of Cynthia Owen for a full public inquiry into her case, which I have raised a number of times? Cynthia Owen alleges she was raped as a ten-year-old child and that gardaí were involved in her abuse. Her baby was brutally killed and evidence about that killing disappeared. When I last spoke to her legal representatives, they told me they still had no indication that there would be a proper public inquiry into this appalling case where the most serious allegations were made, including those against gardaí. I draw the attention of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to a question of international justice. This Thursday is the 28th birthday of Chelsea Manning, the imprisoned US whistleblower who did the world a great service in blowing the whistle on many of the nefarious and brutal activities of the US, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who is languishing in prison-----

I met with President el-Sisi in Paris and New York at the UN Millennium Development Goals summit. Maybe that is what made me think of Messi. It is not for us to direct the Egyptian authorities but we reminded President el-Sisi that he holds presidential powers with regard to release of individuals and this has happened in a number of other cases. He was very open and frank in that discussion about where his powers are. This trial was postponed on a number of occasions not because of anything Ibrahim Halawa was unable to offer, but because of the inability of others to attend court. It is a very big trial, as the Deputy is aware. I repeated that to the Egyptian President when I met him at the climate change summit in Paris. The Egyptian ambassador sent a letter quite recently pointing out the responsibility and opportunity of the Egyptian Government. I cannot dictate to another jurisdiction in respect of its system but we have made perfectly clear our interest in having young Ibrahim Halawa returned home to his family and we will continue to maintain a high level of awareness in and activity level about him through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the consular activities in Cairo. I hope that on the next occasion, the situation can be changed and that it might be possible for the Egyptian President to consider his use of presidential powers in respect of pardon. In respect of the panel, many of these cases have been around for quite a long time. Some of them have gone through the circuit in the courts already. When they were brought to my attention, we set up a panel of legal experts to look at each case, the background and story and what might or might not be done. The Minister for Justice and Equality appointed a member of the Judiciary to respond properly to each individual. I understand that in the vast majority of cases, no further action is proposed. This will not be acceptable to some people who have lived a life with some of these cases. Action is recommended by the panel in a number of cases and is referred to in the letters sent out by the-----

I have some questions about the Cabinet Committee on Health. The Taoiseach told us some time ago that this committee was going to drive forward reform as identified in the Fine Gael manifesto and the programme for Government.The universal health insurance process was the major plank of reform the Government identified, together with the abolition of the Health Service Executive but given that it has now abandoned the universal health insurance objective and while continuing to describe the HSE as a failure, it has failed to abolish it, what is the Cabinet Committee on Health achieving? Does the Taoiseach accept that the reform programme has been exposed as nothing more than a recipe for massive charges to the public and worse services in many areas of the health service? What are his views on the new idea of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that the health service should be run through health trusts and that management of health services might be privatised in circumstances where delivery does not meet his view of what it should be? The Minister for Health is generally regarded as a very talented member of the Cabinet and the public welcomed his appointment to the Department of Health, expecting that he would deliver radical reform. It now feels, however, that rather than being a leader of health reform, he has become a lead commentator on the health service. Will the Taoiseach be in a position to do anything about that?

Did that committee meet at all and can the Taoiseach give us some sense of what it did? Questions to the Taoiseach allow the Opposition leaders scrutinise the work of the Department of the Taoiseach but the Ceann Comhairle has to keep to the rules. We appreciate, however, the latitude he allows at times. The Taoiseach, who was in opposition for so long, understands the need to give as much information as possible without breaching the imperative of Cabinet confidentiality. Would it be possible to change that protocol given all the talk of democratic revolution and so on, the importance of Cabinet committees and their primary role in shaping Government policy and given that our ability to scrutinise the content of their discussion is not very transparent or accountable and is the opposite of democracy?

The long-term view is to have a single universal health care system but I have to admit the method by which the Government was to do this is no longer accepted as valid because it was too costly, as identified by the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute. The Government will not proceed with that particular model. As I have said in response to previous questions on primary care, community care, the fair deal scheme and the provision of local facilities, we have followed through on those in a very big way, overseeing the introduction of general practitioner cards for children under the age of six and adults over the age of 70 and moving on to the children under 12 years of age of working families. We have also focused on a healthy Ireland with initiatives in the preventive medicine area, activity levels and the opportunity for so many people to have healthier lifestyles, be it in respect of food, drink or whatever. The Deputy must have noticed the publication of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 last week in respect of advertising alcohol given the damage that can cause. Changes will be made such that it will not appear around schools or children. We need more investment in the community primary care facilities. That is another reason to ensure a continuation of the strong recovery taking place. Most importantly, we need to invest in infrastructure, the recruitment of nurses and doctors and non-consultant hospital doctors. I gave the Deputy figures on that today. We also need to invest in the facilities. Last week Deputy Martin asked about the accident and emergency unit in Galway. The Minister for Health gave him a detailed reply. It is part of a major expansion of the hospital facilities in Galway and the various pieces of equipment there. While it is not as one would wish, it is part of a major reorganisation of the facilities at that hospital. We need a strong economy to be able to drive continued investment in such areas. What questions did Deputy Adams ask? His second question was something about being anti-democratic.

On the last occasion I discussed with it the question of the derogation in respect of Irish being a European language.

Yesterday I attended a little function in the west where people have used some of the resources given by the Aire Stáit and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to promote Irish business, Irish manufactured goods, to identify people who can speak Gaeilge and who are not afraid to speak it and to use many of the very modern ways of communicating language.

Given the consistent and horrendous flooding families have been experiencing in recent times, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is investigating the implementation of a Bill similar to the UK Water Act 2014? This matter was raised in the House last week by my party leader, Deputy Micheál Martin. As the Taoiseach knows, such legislation would allow home owners and businesses in areas prone to flooding to obtain insurance cover at a reasonable price. It would also require the State to be directly involved in a joint approach. Will the Taoiseach confirm that something is happening in that regard? We heard some positive soundings on the matter from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney. Will the Taoiseach also confirm the type of insurance model that will be introduced for persons who have been adversely affected by the floods? As regards the Constitutional Convention's outstanding reports, the Government has accepted recommendations on the holding of referenda on blasphemy, reducing the voting age and the setting up of an electoral commission. For several months many Members have been raising these issues and we were given firm assurances that we would have an opportunity to debate the three outstanding reports before Christmas. However, that has not come to pass. Is there some prospect that these matters will be prioritised if we return in January? All of us but particularly the citizen members were enormously proud to be given an opportunity to participate in the convention. It is a considerable disappointment, therefore, that the House has not adhered to the timelines the Taoiseach himself set for us to consider all of these reports.

The purpose is to share information on flood risk and how it might be factored into the commercial assessments made by insurance companies. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has referred to the necessity to put in place a much more sophisticated weather forecasting and flood warning system which would be of benefit to everybody, including business premises, private dwellings and the agri-sector. I have given a commitment that the issue will be looked at, but what was introduced in Britain would not be suitable here because houses completed since 2009 were left out, as were small businesses. In Bandon, Athlone, Crossmolina and elsewhere most of those affected are small shopkeepers and other retailers. One cannot have a situation where they would be left out. There is no intention to set out on a course to introduce further insurance levies.

I understand the public sector standards Bill and the planning Bill were brought before the Cabinet today. The public sector standards Bill deals with the replacement of the Standards in Public Office Commission. The objective of the planning Bill is to establish a so-called independent regulator, but, in this case, the regulator is to be answerable to the Minister. An Teachta Brian Stanley has published a planning and development (amendment) Bill today to provide for genuinely independent planning regulation. While I do not have any expectation that the Government will support the Bill, nonetheless, it highlights the serious flaws in the Government's Bill. Were the public sector standards Bill and the planning Bill considered this morning and, if so, when will they be published? Last week I raised with the Taoiseach the Government's failure to publish a report on breaches of planning rules in six councils, a report which has been sitting on the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government since July. The review was set up almost three years ago after the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, had scrapped planned inquiries into planning irregularities. When will the report be published? If it is published before the Christmas recess which seems unlikely, may we have a debate on it, if not before Christmas then at the first available opportunity after the Dáil resumes in January? The purpose of the health information and patient safety Bill is to legislate for better governance in respect of health information and patient safety. I recently met the mothers of a number of young women who had received the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil. I understand that last night TV3 broadcast a distressing documentary on the health consequences for almost 140 young women who had received the vaccine. The mothers I met had had great difficulty in obtaining information, which is why I am raising the issue. The health information and patient safety Bill will make it easier for citizens to obtain all the knowledge they deserve to have. I understand the European Medical Agency has cleared the vaccine for use, but it is equally clear that a substantial number of young women and their parents attribute their illness to it. When will the Bill be published? Allowing for the Ceann Comhairle's latitude, will the Taoiseach consider meeting the organisation, REGRET, which represents the young women concerned and their parents?

The Bill is being drafted and will be published in the new year. The planning Bill mentioned by the Deputy was approved by the Cabinet this morning, with the appointment of a regulator and the publication of the six reports commissioned a few years ago. It was also noted that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government could proceed to implement the recommendations made in so far as it was concerned and that other measures that would require Government approval would be brought back by the Minister in due course. The final Bill mentioned by the Deputy was the public sector standards Bill 2015. This morning the Government approved the text of the Bill which is to be presented to the Dáil or the Seanad and circulated to Deputies and Senators. It also approved the explanatory memorandum. As the Deputy knows, the Bill has been designed to simplify, modernise and streamline the current legislative ethics framework which is in urgent need of reform. It seeks to respond to the extensive and detailed recommendations made by the Mahon tribunal and to meet the commitment made in the statement for Government to publish legislation to consolidate local and national ethics requirements and give effect to the recommendations made by tribunals. The Government cleared the Bill this morning for publication and the public sector standard will replace the SIPO. It will obviously be able to have many more authoritative opportunities to deal with ethics and matters surrounding them in the time ahead. The Deputy will be getting a copy of the Bill.

On the bail Bill and the various bail provisions, to what extent can we expect them to be concluded before the end of this session? The health and wellbeing (calorie posting and workplace wellbeing) Bill has been promised. Given the emphasis on health and diet control, when is the Bill likely to be brought before the House? In view of its importance, would it be possible to bring it before the House ahead of schedule?

I hope the planning process will flow smoothly. It will be the largest infrastructural development in the country for many years and I can confirm that the board is working exceptionally well. Obviously, it needs to make preparations for the integration of the other hospitals when it becomes an entity. I will come back to the Deputy on it. The calories Bill is still below the radar and was commented on. I will come back to the Deputy on it. Did the Deputy ask about a third Bill?

Twelve months ago HIQA recommended that patients be transferred to minor injury units, where appropriate, rather than bringing them to emergency departments. No. 98 on the list of promised legislation is the health reform Bill. Can we have this issue looked at under that Bill? The policy is forcing older people to lie on trolleys in emergency departments for hours when they could be treated at their local hospital. I know that the Taoiseach tasked Deputy Martin Heydon to produce a report on flooding on the River Shannon. Can that report be placed in the Oireachtas Library?

I have the report which he gave me some time ago. I do not have a problem in having it placed in the Oireachtas Library and I am quite sure the Deputy would not either. On the ambulance service, this has been an issue from a union point of view for quite a long time. It is a problem in that a patient from Shrule in need of an ambulance will be brought to Galway. Obviously, the ambulance will have to wait. If the patient was to go in the other direction to Mayo General Hospital, he or she might be admitted and attended to in a greatly reduced time. The regulation or practice is that they be taken to the nearest hospital. Obviously, it might not be the most appropriate, as the Deputy has pointed out. It is an issue of reform that will be looked at. It is a work practice.

It was inspired by the battle of an exceptionally brave Irish woman, the late Marie Fleming, who while in the final stages of multiple sclerosis took a landmark challenge to the Supreme Court on Ireland's legal ban on assisted suicide She lost that battle but the Chief Justice said in the case at that time there was nothing in the judgment to prevent the State from introducing legislative measures with appropriate safeguards to deal with such cases as hers. This well thought-out Bill contains exactly those safeguards, setting out strictly monitored criteria to allow a person in abnormal suffering to choose a dignified pain-free death surrounded by loved ones, rather than to continue to endure their excruciating torture with no quality of life, often completely incapacitated and in an unconscious state and then to die an horrendous death. We are talking about people who in their most desperate moment of life are being deprived of their humanitarian rights. I know this issue is a taboo with many Deputies but it is already being debated throughout Europe. Euthanasia or assisted suicide is already legal in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It is an ethical issue this country will have to address sooner or later. People are living longer with the result that the rate of chronic illness is on the rise. The need to legislate for dying with dignity, as proposed in the Bill, is also being widely debated in Irish society. Various opinion polls during the current Dáil estimate that approximately seven out of ten people would be in favour of assisted suicide for people suffering with a terminal illness. Dáil Éireann must enter the debate and when we do we must leave religious dogma at the door. I anticipate concerns about the Bill from many Deputies and I wish to make clear that it proposes clear protection for vulnerable people. Two separate medical practitioners are required to examine the qualifying person and sign a valid declaration that their decision is voluntary and they have an incurable and progressive illness which cannot be reversed by treatment and which is likely to lead to their death. A third independent witness, who is not a beneficiary of their estate, must also testify that the person has a clear and settled intention to end their own life when their illness becomes too much to bear. At all times safeguards must be met to show the terminally ill person has reached their decision on an informed basis and without coercion or duress. Furthermore, no doctor will be obliged to participate in an assisted death if he or she has a conscientious objection. This is a complex, not to mention contentious subject. I welcome debate from all sides when the Bill comes up for discussion. I have spoken to many Deputies on all sides of the House who have spoken about compassion and have told me that if there is a free vote they would consider voting for the Bill. Every one of us strives for, requires and desires a quality of life but we also strive for, require and desire a quality of death. That is what the Bill is about. We should not leave competent human beings to suffer intolerable and horrible pain if the person in question wants to exit this life. Suicide has been decriminalised but we still criminalise a person who assists somebody who is terminally ill to die. That is unfair, inhumane and against the human right of the person who wants to exit this life of their own free will because of immense and intolerable suffering. If the Bill is debated in the new year I urge Members to show compassion when debating it. As ever, I respect the views of everyone in this House. Everyone has a right to a proper debate and to speak without abuse. My father suffered a stroke eight years ago and had a terrible existence. He was incontinent and he could not swallow. Solid food had to be liquidised and liquids had to be solidified yet he fought to live. People who fight to live and want to survive should be given the opportunity and all the help they require but a small percentage of people are unable to bear the suffering and they also should be allowed to have a dignified death.

There was a good deal of controversy some time ago when a particular bank proposed to limit banking transactions of under €700, which is quite a sum of money, to automatic teller machines, ATMs. Thankfully, that bank has withdrawn its plan to do so in the short term but one would wonder if it was an expedition on its part to assess public reaction, wait a while and bring back the proposal. That proposal would cause great distress, particularly if it was replicated by other banks.  It is a time of the year when we think of the elderly, of people who are alone and people who may not be in a position to help themselves. There is a large number of people, typically, but not only, elderly people, who are not able to use ATMs and bank cards, who find that the only way they can avail of banking services is over the counter and who rely on that personal touch. They may simply be too old now to learn to use an ATM, the use of which, I presume, most Members of this House would take for granted. Similarly, there is an increased movement towards providing public services through the Internet. When people ask how to apply for a service, they are told they will find the relevant application form on the Internet. People pay their local property tax online; it is very hard to pay it over a counter. There is an increasing tendency to pay online. This Bill proposes to ensure that people are able to avail of banking services over the counter and also to avail of public services over the counter.  A Bill to provide for persons with a disability was introduced in 2005 to ensure persons with a disability could access public services, that there would be a person in every branch office who would ensure that persons with a disability could access public services. Essentially, this Bill uses similar terminology and makes a similar proposal, namely, that all public services would ensure that persons who could not use or are unable to access the Internet would still be able to avail of public services, be they those provided by a Department, a county council, an organisation of the State or the Revenue Commissioners, and ensure that people are able to interact, for example, with the Revenue Commissioners over a counter, or pay bills as they fall due over a counter as opposed to having to use the Internet to make bank transfers because a large number of people cannot do that. While I accept there is an additional cost involved for banks in providing banking services, face to face, and for public services to provide a service for people who cannot use the Internet, there is a reason they are trying to drive increasingly more business, more customers, more members of the public, in the case of public services, to the Internet. Nevertheless, it is essential for this State to ensure such access for people, typically those who are elderly, people who are living alone and do not have a relative to help them. I have discussed this issue with many parishioners and friends and they have told me that they have ended up doing increasingly more transactions for their parents who are elderly and who are not able to use the Internet. They are happy to do so, as am I, but at this time of the year in particular, we should think of people who do not have a son or a daughter or a relative who can do transactions on the Internet or whom they might not trust with a bank card to go to an ATM and withdraw money or pay a bill on their behalf. That is the purpose of this Bill. I thank the Acting Chairman for the time afforded me to introduce the Bill.

It provides for the appointment of an independent planning regulator. The importance of having a planning regulator with real powers to regulate the planning sector was brought home to everybody in the past week. The Mahon tribunal, a necessary but expensive one, recommended that we would have in place the office of an independent planning regulator to end and root out corruption, be it at local government level or at national government level. We saw an example of people willing to engage in corruption last week, courtesy of RTE. We saw Joe, Hugh and John who were more than willing to accept bribes and money in return for dodgy planning. Some would suggest we should take the power of zoning and other planning powers, such as the Part 8 provisions, from planners. We, in Sinn Féin, would disagree with that and we would not support it. That is a very simplistic view. The majority of decisions taken by councillors are good ones. They represent and are accountable to their local community. The vast majority of the 949 councillors are decent men and women who represent their community and best interests of their locality and their county. However, there will always be a few and the stopping of those few is what this Bill is about. The Government pledged in 2011 that it would implement the recommendations of that tribunal and the key recommendation, to which I referred, has not been acted on. I note that the Government brought a Bill to Cabinet today to provide for the establishment of a planning regulator. However, there are key differences between what I and Sinn Féin are proposing in the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill and what the Government is proposing in its Bill. If the proposed office of planning regulator does not have teeth or real powers, it will not be effective. The Government's proposed Bill will provide that such an office would have the power to monitor and make recommendations and to give feedback to local authorities but does not go much further than that. The difference between it and our proposed Bill is that such an office would not only have the power to make independent appraisal of local area plans, county development plans and guidelines but it would have the power to give directions to planning authorities, local authorities and regional authorities. Such an office would have the power to investigate systemic problems and irregularities in the planning system and report back to this House. Such an office would provide training for councillors, which is essential, because there is a big turnover of councillors at every local election. It is good that there is a turnover of councillors but we must equip them. Where there are instances of wrongdoing, people will be fined or imprisoned under our proposed Bill and it provides for sanctions to be imposed on those few people who are willing to engage in this type of practice. Firm sanctions are required to stamp it out. Crucially, such an office would have the power to bring proceedings for an offence under the planning regulations and people could be prosecuted by the planning regulator.  I note that the Government side accepted or did not oppose the previous two Bills and it brought forward a planning Bill to Cabinet today but none of us in this House is as smart as all of us together. We do not possess all the wisdom in this area nor does the Government. In the spirit of co-operation, we should be all singing from the one hymn sheet on this issue. We need to stamp out corruption because it is corrosive to local government and the body politic and it drags down the whole political system. We should start 2016, the centenary of the 1916 Rising, by ensuring we do everything possible to stamp out corruption in that year. Acceptance of this proposed Bill is a good way to start off that year. The Taoiseach has his Bill and we have our one and there are sections of our Bill that would make his Bill stronger. I ask him to accept this Bill and to let it progress to Committee Stage in order that we can stamp out that type of corruption. We have the opportunity with this proposed Bill to do that.

This crisis will require our health service to be adequately resourced and equipped to deal with an influx of patients requiring timely and accessible treatment. Furthermore, we also hear about the detonation of a time bomb, which is sure to have catastrophic consequences. While one could be forgiven for thinking this crisis indicates a looming, dreadful tragedy, the reality is it is one of the great success stories of our time. Irish people are living longer, they are living more healthily and they are living more active lives. One of the consequences of this is that the proportion of our population over the age of 65 is set to increase steeply in the coming years. This poses challenges in how we provide services to support older people to live the lives they choose, but it is also an opportunity to support positive ageing, to see older people as a group that contributes to our society and that benefits our communities. We must prepare to deal with these demographic challenges. When we talk about planning for an ageing population, what we are talking about is developing an age-friendly society not only for those currently over the age of 65 but for all of us who hope and wish to grow old in the future. Planning requires a whole-of-government approach and while the Departments of Health and Social Protection are the ones we first think of in the context of older people, programmes and initiatives are also run by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, which provide services and supports to older people. The national positive ageing strategy, NPAS, sets out a blueprint for how policies and services could be designed to protect the rights of older people. The strategy was finally published in 2013 following six years of discussion. It took the combined efforts of three Governments, five political parties and three Ministers for older people simply to get it published. The strategy provides a roadmap for Ireland to begin planning for the needs of older people now and in the decades to come, but more than two and a half years on, we are still waiting for the implementation plan to set out how this ambitious strategy will be delivered and implemented. It will transform the lives of older people today and the millions of us who hope to grow old. I urge the Minister to prioritise the implementation of this transformative strategy. We will all grow old and we should be able to do so safe in the knowledge that our Government will prioritise our needs.

I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in the Seanad. The programme for Government committed to completing and implementing the NPAS in order that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. The strategy was published in April 2013 and provides the blueprint for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to planning for an ageing society. The NPAS provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four national goals and underpinning objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing. The strategy aims to promote the health, well-being and quality of life of older people by focusing on issues relevant to them across the policy development and service delivery process. This is a cross-departmental strategy. Improving health, well-being and quality of life of older people will be a gradual and progressive process involving a shift in mindset by Government, policy makers, service providers, and, indeed, all of society. A healthy and positive ageing initiative has been established to implement the research objective of the NPAS. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE's health and well-being programme and Atlantic Philanthropies. The initiative will monitor changes in older people's health and well-being linked to the goals and objectives of the strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years. The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the initiative. It is clear that a great deal is happening across government that is of relevance and of benefit to older people. My Department is currently considering how best to ensure that the objectives included in the strategy, which are mostly broad, will inform all policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future. We are still in the early stages of implementation, but the NPAS is a clear indication by Government of the importance that it attaches to older people. The strategy is a commitment to ensuring Ireland will be a society that both celebrates and prepares for population ageing and the aim is to become a society in which the equality, independence, participation, care self-fulfilment and dignity of older people are pursued at all times.

The root of the problem is that there is no co-ordination and overall responsibility for its implementation. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is charged with leading on the development of age-friendly workplaces while the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is charged with the development of alternative housing options that meet the needs of older persons. Some Departments are proceeding with the objectives but there is no overall co-ordination and implementation plan that brings together their disparate efforts. It is imperative that such a plan be developed for the strategy to be successful. It should set out clear timelines against which progress can be measured. We need to act decisively, engaging all arms of government to address the needs of the current and future generations of older people.

I become concerned when I hear people talking about an ageing crisis, a demographic time bomb and so on. We should look on ageing as an enormous opportunity, for which, of course, we have to plan. The fact that people are living so long highlights the success of modern medicine and health care. They would not have lived as long in the past but I acknowledge we need to prepare. My Department has made a particular effort in the past year to put additional resources into the fair deal scheme, home care packages and other measures to support people later in life and that will continue in the service plan being published tomorrow. Overall responsibility for the strategy falls to the Minister of State with responsibility for older people in my Department, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, but the objectives come under a diverse range of Departments and agencies, each of which has to play its role. It is a cross-departmental strategy and there have been ongoing contacts with all relevant Departments and agencies. On foot of these contacts, the Department has formulated the proposed new arrangements to improve engagement among stakeholders and the relevant Departments and agencies. This is now up for discussion with the Department of the Taoiseach prior to formal submission to the senior officials group and the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. It is intended that the new implementation arrangements will be agreed by the end of this year with a view to submitting them to the senior officials group early in 2016.

Inpatient numbers exceed 20,000 every year. It is, therefore, a substantial hospital, serving a population of 160,000 across the county.Over the years, based on inpatient numbers, Letterkenny University Hospital has been allocated the lowest budget of any hospital in the State and the lowest number of medical staff. It has been discriminated against by Government after Government. There are serious concerns throughout the hospital about the numbers of staff, the budget and the impact it has on waiting lists and trolley numbers. As the Minister is probably aware, the number on trolleys in Letterkenny University Hospital continues to increase and in 2015 almost reached the peak of 2006-2007. Management of the hospital, acting on behalf of the Saolta hospital group, has instructed consultant surgeons to scale back on elective surgeries during the month of January and early February to make beds available for additional people who present in accident and emergency. The most recent figures on waiting lists at Letterkenny hospital show there are 13,950 outpatients, 3,338 of which have been waiting for more than a year. Those are citizens in Donegal who have been waiting more than a year for surgical procedures or appointments with consultants. There are an additional 1,742 inpatients on the waiting list, which is a shocking waiting list. It is well known in the hospital that this instruction will lead to the growth of those waiting lists. It is my view, and that of my party, that the Minister will focus on not having patients on trolleys this winter because it will not look good in the mouth of an election and to achieve this he will sacrifice patients on the waiting list. That belief was confirmed by comments made today by Liam Doran of the INMO. What choices has the Minister made? Will he intervene and send a clear message to the management of the Saolta hospital group asking why this instruction, which will result in the growth of the already shocking waiting lists in Donegal, has been issued? Why can it not address the issues in accident and emergency departments without growing the waiting list even further?  I also want to bring to the Minister's attention the profound concerns of senior staff in the hospital about this instruction. They have outlined those concerns to the management of the hospital which in my view is carrying out the instructions of its masters in the Saolta hospital group which in turn is carrying out the Minister's instructions. It is a political imperative to sacrifice patients in order to have as few people on trolleys this winter as possible. The Minister cannot rob Peter to pay Paul. Will he intervene on this issue and reassure the patients on waiting lists in Donegal that he will not allow this to happen in January and February?

In preparation for the 2015-2016 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE, outlining how they will implement an integrated approach across primary, community, social and acute services to manage winter pressures. This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and expedite discharges from hospital. If emergency department overcrowding occurs, all hospitals have escalation plans to manage patient flow and patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimal patient care. In November, a national emergency department congestion escalation directive was issued on foot of discussions between the director general of the HSE and me on how best to reduce emergency department congestion with all of the available resources, both within and outside of acute hospitals. This directive requires hospitals to implement their escalation plan whenever their emergency department experiences overcrowding. As part of this, acute hospitals are now required to take specific steps to reduce overcrowding such as the postponement of non-urgent elective procedures. During winter planning, Letterkenny University Hospital made a decision to scale back the number of scheduled inpatient admissions for approximately six weeks from 4 January to mid-February 2016. This is primarily to manage the predicted increased number of patients who normally attend and are admitted to the hospital via the emergency department at this time of year. This is already done in many other hospitals around the country and is considered to be good planning. In the past, in January, procedures were often cancelled or deferred at short notice. Rather than scheduling and then potentially deferring patients, the hospital has decided to reduce the number of inpatient procedures scheduled during this period to ensure that in so far as possible, patients who are scheduled are admitted and cancellations are therefore less frequent. This temporary reduction will ensure that each surgeon has a dedicated amount of theatre time in January and that emergency surgery, including cancer surgery, is prioritised. The hospital regrets any inconvenience this situation may cause to patients and their families and I wish to echo that. However, I have been assured by the HSE and Saolta that the effect of these arrangements will be kept under constant review and urgent patients, including cancer patients, will continue to be seen. The hospital's overall aim is to avoid unnecessary deferrals or cancellations of planned surgery and ensure that hospital resources are targeted at emergency work during this period of the year when the pressure on the emergency department is greatest.

Neither Letterkenny University Hospital nor the Saolta hospital group has advertised for a replacement consultant urologist. As a result, urology is in real crisis in the hospital. I commend the Minister's officials for organising a meeting in February 2015. It was a good meeting at which solutions were tabled to address another crisis that had emerged in breast cancer care which was raised by the consultant there, Michael Sugrue. The meeting was attended by public representatives in Donegal and cancer campaign groups. We understood these solutions had been implemented but as we see from correspondence from the consultant breast surgeon there, Michael Sugrue to the Minister's officials, they have not been implemented. Letterkenny University Hospital is a hospital in crisis in Donegal. The management of Saolta is in denial and is telling us it has the resources it needs, everything is hunky-dory, there is nothing to see here and to move along. There are only two permanent consultant surgeons in the seventh largest hospital in the State serving 160,000 people. The rest are locums. Those surgeons are being told to pull back on elective surgeries to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of people on trolleys in winter. It is not good enough. The Minister is aware of the comments of the director general of the HSE, Tony O'Brien. We have a real crisis in our health service and we need solutions, not commentary. Will the Minister intervene in respect of the concerns of patients on the waiting lists in Donegal, which will continue to grow? Will he confront the management of Letterkenny University Hospital and the Saolta hospital group about their denials in terms of the resources they have when the problems are staring us in the face?

I am told they will be made available from this week. This is a real action, not commentary or window dressing; it is ten additional beds for the hospital which represents a significant increase in capacity. It is normal for hospitals around the country to flex up and down their elective surgical activity - to do less in January and February when the emergency department is very busy and many people are coming through it and do more in the summer period when the emergency departments are relatively quiet. That makes sense and I hope the Deputy understands why that is. It is not intended to apply to urgent and cancer surgeries, which it is unsafe to defer. Budgets are not allocated based on inpatient numbers because hospitals do a lot more than treat inpatients - they have outpatients, day-cases, laboratories and, in some cases, specialties. Where a hospital has very expensive specialties, such as cancer or spinal surgery, it will need a higher budget, so it is incorrect to compare budgets based solely on inpatient numbers.  The conversion year for activity based funding is 2016. For the first time, hospitals will achieve a chunk of their budget based on their activity, which will benefit hospitals that are more efficient than others. All hospitals will claim they are more efficient than others. Activity based funding will show whether that is the case.I am told efforts to restore the urology services are currently in hand. As regards intervention in the management of individual hospitals or hospital groups, that is not practical. Every hospital has its own management which, in turn, has my support. It is important they are allowed to do their job. It would not be practical or possible for any Minister to try to manage every hospital or health care institution in the country. Were that to occur, the management of those institutions would be undermined.

However, had there been a small bit of pre-planning once the heavy rain was anticipated a lot more properties could have been saved from the flooding. Since the last serious flooding event in 2009, some remedial works, which are welcome and have been successful, were carried out in some towns but more were postponed upon completion of the catchment flood risk assessment and management report. Delays in obtaining pumps and sandbags impacted on particular towns and communities. There is need for a protocol to be put in place to ensure that this does not happen again. We have experienced two 100-year flood events in the past six years. The probability is that we are going to experience more 100-year flooding events in the not too distant future and we need to be prepared for them. I welcome that businesses are eligible for funding under the humanitarian support scheme put in place by the Government. However, funding under this scheme will be only in respect of returning a business to its state pre-flooding and not for any loss of earnings incurred. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be aware that this fund which is being administered through the Department of Social Protection does not facilitate the many businesspeople who do not have money to put bread and butter on the table because to be eligible for this funding their homes had to be flooded. As such, these people have no current income and will be at a loss of income that would have been generated during the most profitable time of the year, which money would usually carry them through the lean months in the early part of next year. Something needs to be done to assist these people. I would like to put a number of questions to the Minister of State in regard to the application form for this funding. First, can a landlord who signs a form for a tenant in respect of a commercial premises also make an application under this scheme for structural damage to that premises? Second, will consideration be given to inclusion under this scheme of landlords whose private residential properties have been damaged by flooding, which properties need to be repaired and returned to the market as quickly as possible? Third, why must an applicant provide evidence that a property has been flooded? We were told that no documentation would be required in respect of the initial €5,000 claim. It now transpires that the initial application must be verified by a local authority prior to its being forwarded to the Irish Red Cross Society, which creates an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. My concern is that this will discourage some people from availing of this funding. There is also a need for engagement with the banks to ensure there is flexibility in relation to loans, including extension of same and so on. A rates release scheme must also be put in place on behalf of victims of flooded commercial premises. The Taoiseach said earlier in the House that farming is a business but it is specifically excluded from the Irish Red Cross Society administered scheme. A considerable amount of fodder has been damaged and destroyed. While this not an issue now the unavailability of fodder in the early part of next year will be an animal welfare issue. Financial provision needs to be made for farmers that have lost fodder as a result of the recent flooding.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	351	I, too, acknowledge the contribution of all of the agencies, including the county councils, the Irish Red Cross Society, the Civil Defence, and volunteers from local communities in terms of their efforts during the recent flooding. The Government has approved an allocation of €5 million to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses, which through no fault of their own have been unable to secure flood insurance and were recently flooded. The Irish Red Cross Society has agreed to administer the scheme. The objective of the scheme is to provide a once-off ex-gratia contribution towards the costs of damage incurred by those small businesses which were unable to secure flood insurance and were flooded arising from the impact of Storm Desmond during the period 4 December to 17 December 2015. The scheme is aimed at providing a contribution to the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock. It applies only to rateable premises that have been flooded and it is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution rather than compensation for loss or a replacement for the cover provided by insurance. The nature of the impact on businesses affected by the flooding required that as an emergency measure a speedy process be put in place to meet their needs. In this regard, a two-step approach is being taken, involving an initial application which, if successful will lead to a quick payment to be capped at €5,000 per property. I am informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, that there will be a five-day turnaround or less in this regard. As such, the scheme is not overly bureaucratic. There must be clarification in relation to whether a property was flooded and if at the time of the flooding it was a rateable premises. To say that the application system is slow and laborious is untrue. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, was involved in the design of this scheme. It has been designed in such a way as to ensure a quick turnaround of applications to assist businesspeople to resume business as soon as possible. It is anticipated that some businesses will have incurred significant damages and will require a more detailed assessment of losses incurred. In these cases, a second more detailed assessment of losses incurred will be required. This will provide the scope for a further payment, with the total payment available capped at €20,000. However, this will be a more lengthy process requiring a detailed assessment. The total level of support available under both stages will be capped at €20,000. The criteria for qualification for payment under the scheme are as follows: only those small businesses that could not secure flood insurance are eligible; for the purpose of this scheme, a small business will be defined as one with up to 20 employees; the business premises must have been flooded during the period 4 December and 17 December 2015, with this verified by the relevant local authority; any location within the State that was flooded during the period in question is encompassed by the scheme and at the time of the flood, the business must have been trading and in a rateable premises. Applications forms are available on the Irish Red Cross Society website. The scheme is targeted at trading businesses rather than landlords. It is anticipated that this will address the vast majority of businesses affected. However, where particular circumstances arise, each case will be dealt with on an individual basis. The emergency scheme does not apply to farmers. Farmers in flooded areas can make contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine animal welfare helpline at Callsave 076 1064408 or 01 6072379 or Teagasc at 076 1113555. I will bring the Deputy's concerns regarding farmers to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who is unavailable today.I have no doubt that the farming organisations, whether the IFA, ICMSA, ICSA Ireland or others, will be involved in ensuring there are no feed shortages. One has to applaud the IFA. In 2009, it stepped up to the mark and helped out all farmers on an individual basis by getting fodder from other parts of the country and bringing it to flood-risk areas. I have no doubt farmers will not be left wanting when they have the likes of the IFA and other such organisations at their disposal.

The Minister said, "No" at the time. Will the Minister of State take the issue up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ask him to extend the criteria relating to it? While I am on the issue of flood prevention, I will raise a matter with the two Ministers of State present. It would help if the criteria for the home renovation incentive scheme were amended to deal with the issue of flood prevention in domestic situations. I earnestly ask both Ministers of State to examine if we can put a small, tight grant aid scheme in place for households outside the flood mitigation areas. Provision will not be made for them under that scheme. I ask that they would have access to financial assistance where practical solutions can be put in place to protect their homes.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response that there is no specific provision for the agriculture industry but thank him for his commitment to take it up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am also disappointed that there is no provision for commercial landlords and private residential property landlords. These properties will now remain sterile, in particular residential properties. There is no assistance in terms of getting them refurbished. The tenants will move out and, naturally enough, will not move back in and one cannot blame them. Something needs to be done to assist these landlords. The intention was to streamline the process in so far as is possible. However, the application process requires an applicant for the maximum grant of €5,000 to submit detailed estimates of the cost of the works to be carried out or the cost of recovering stock. Applicants will need assistance in this regard. They will have to get a builder to put a price on it and will then have to send it to the local authority to be certified. It will then be sent to the Irish Red Cross. There are at least two separate outside bodies involved before it gets to the Irish Red Cross. I accept that it might be processed within five days once received but the structure is not simple. Will the Minister of State examine it again?

An interdepartmental group is examining all the issues raised by Deputy Naughten and it will report early next year. A number of other issues are also currently being examined by the group. I remind the Deputy that we are spending taxpayers' money and, therefore, there must be a trail. It is not as simple as having a person show up at the Irish Red Cross office and say his or her property was flooded and needs €5,000. The Irish Red Cross cannot verify the cost involved there and then. It will have to be verified by the local authority. The scheme is not asking much from the business person. He or she will be getting €5,000, which is a fairly substantial sum of money. A further sum of money is also available, subject to further verification, if a premises has been flooded. The scheme could not be much simpler than what it is currently. I understand that a large number of business people have suffered losses of earnings and so forth but the Irish Red Cross is doing a fabulous job in administering the scheme and will turn over applications as quickly as possible.  I do not want the Deputy or anyone else to take me up wrong but there was a huge amount of hysteria on the part of our national broadcaster, in particular, for a number of days. It was almost at the point of saying that towns and businesses were closed and to stay away. A relation in Athlone told me that it was necessary for the town to say that it was not closed and that business premises were still open and trading.

It was saying on the national airwaves, whether it was on the six o'clock news, the nine o'clock news or in hourly bulletins, that all these towns and businesses were closed but the opposite was true. Businesses were still open and operating and they wanted to continue operating. The period coming up to Christmas is a prime time of the year for them and they want Christmas shoppers. I would like RTE, our national and public broadcaster, to be more careful in its reporting. It is very well for it to be broadcasting the news but it should take into account that it is dealing with family businesses which, at the end of the day, need to make a crust. As Minister of State in the Department of Defence, I congratulate the Defence Forces across the country. They risked their lives, as did many others, in the floods. The Defence Forces and the Civil Defence did a brilliant job over the past two weeks and will continue to be at the beck and call of the people, as required.

Their lives have been seriously disrupted through the flooding of their homes, the battle to keep water out of their homes, the total submergence of farmlands and the impact on livestock. All this ultimately impacts on the profitability of those farms. Business premises have been flooded and roads have been rendered impassable. These roads have been inundated with water and this has impacted on the ability of some to get to work and their children to school. I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with a number of the sites which have been flooded. Around Scarriff Harbour, the MacNamaras have been flooded. In O'Callaghans Mills, a number of families have been cut off. This is happening on an annual basis. The Clonlara-Springfield area has been impacted by the increased flooding of the River Shannon and the levels maintained by the ESB have been of the greatest concern in the county. This has impacted on the lives of many people. In Mullagh, a bridge was swept away, cutting off four or five families. In and around Ennis, the Tulla Road area is under pressure as is Kildysart Cross. The Minister of State will have seen the iconic pictures of St. Flannan's College, which has been flooded again. The Rowan Tree café, notwithstanding the flood defences in place, has again suffered some flooding. Ballyvaughan and Kilkee and other places to a lesser extent have also suffered. Roads and lands have been impacted and lives and livelihoods are affected.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware, if he has spoken to his predecessors, that it is customary for the Minister to visit the sites, review the damage, offer some complimentary words, talk to people and listen. The Minister of State is always welcome in County Clare but I appeal to him on this occasion to hold off on his visit. He should leave it a while - until he has concrete solutions in place - because this is not the first time for those who have been impacted on this occasion. In some cases, it is not the second, third or fourth time. It has happened on numerous occasions.Their patience is running out. A delegation of politicians in suits walking through what ultimately will be a flooded area in a week or so would only add to their dismay. They want solutions. The Minister of State's time would be better spent sitting with officials and engineers to identify solutions and how they would be paid for.

That said, an effort must be made to find the money required to address the crisis. I wish to suggest a number of possible solutions. There is no doubt that dredging and drainage work must form part of any solution. I am conscious that the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study is in train and hope it will set out some solutions. However, I am also conscious that some of the work will cost so much that it may not be possible to undertake it in the short term. The notion of addressing this issue over a five year period with €400 million or other sum of money is no good to the people affected. They do not have five years to wait; they need action now. There is an opportunity to undertake some smaller flood defence works around a number of homes in a manner similar to the small works scheme. If that scheme could be extended to private property and residences and people come together in a community effort, it might provide an opportunity to put an appropriate solution in place. I know of one farmer in the Clonlara area who had the means to put a relatively inexpensive flood defence system in place and it worked on this occasion, even though his land was probably at the lowest point.  The Minister of State's Department must give some consideration to the possibility of relocation for some families, some of whom will never be able to settle in their homes again. Even if defensive works are put in place to protect their homes, they will still suffer because the surrounding roads are flooded and they are cut off. This must form part of the solutions considered by the Government. I hope the Minister of State will give favourable consideration to these three elements.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	359	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I agree with his initial comments and have said a number of times in the past week or ten days that politicians, regardless of political persuasion, donning wellies and standing around looking sympathetic will not serve much purpose. I visited Bandon and Skibbereen yesterday because the county council had passed a motion calling on me to do so. I also visited Ballinasloe and Crossmolina for similar reasons. Where I have been asked to visit, I have done so, but I have no desire to travel the country visiting people when my time could be more practically spent to come up with solutions, as the Deputy correctly pointed out. That said, where people want me to visit to hear the views of the community, I will do so. I am very much aware of the devastating impact flooding can have on people's lives and livelihoods. I convey my deepest sympathy and that of all Members of the House to those who have been affected by recent flooding, including in County Clare, particularly in areas such as Springfield, Clonlara and wider rural communities. I pay tribute to the resilience of local communities who have been responding for days to the flood alert issued by the local authority. Community efforts are critical to preparing for and managing any flood event or other adverse event. I understand approximately 20,000 sandbags have been distributed throughout County Clare to help to prevent and mitigate flood damage. I also pay tribute to local authority staff, the almost 900 defence personnel - members of Civil Defence, An Garda Síochána and the HSE - and all those who are working day and night to protect life and property and now also engaged in the recovery work.  Obviously, people must continue to heed safety messages until this flood event and flood risk have passed. The Department of Social Protection has a €10 million fund available for households, while the Irish Red Cross is administering a €5 million fund for businesses that have been affected. The Government has asked the Irish Red Cross to make every effort to have this €5 million fund disbursed to businesses before Christmas and I know that it is doing so.  As the Deputy suggested, the core strategy for addressing the significant flood risk in County Clare is the Office of Public Work's CFRAM programme. There are 11 areas identified for further assessment in the county, namely, Bunratty, Ennis, Kilkee, Kilrush, Quin, Shannon, Sixmilebridge, Springfield Clonlara, Shannon Airport, O'Brien's Bridge and Killaloe. These are being assessed within the Shannon CFRAM study. The study is focused on assessing and putting in place solutions to manage areas at greatest risk and the impact of flooding along the River Shannon. It is the only CFRAM study that is focusing on an entire river catchment. The other five studies are focusing on geographic areas. The River Shannon study covers some 17,800 sq. km or 20% of the island of Ireland. It includes 17 counties, including the Deputy's own county of Clare.  The CFRAM programme which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood maps for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. The programme has and will continue to rely on extensive public engagement and consultation. To date, it has included a public consultation to inform the designation of the 300 areas across Ireland at greatest risk from flooding and meet, in person, each of the 300 communities to explain the flood risks for and the impact on them and to obtain their local knowledge and insight. One cannot beat local knowledge.  In County Clare the flood map meetings were held between November 2014 and March 2015. In addition, the OPW is running a national public consultation until 23 December on the draft flood maps which will provide a further opportunity to share information and obtain as much local knowledge as possible. Details are available at Clare County Council's offices in Ennis, Killaloe and Kilrush and on the OPW's website. We are actively examining the options for feasible flood risk solutions for each of the areas and discussing, in person, with each community the possible options. Of the 66 areas that are part of the Shannon CFRAM study, we have discussed options to manage the flood risk with 48 of the communities and the remainder will be done in early 2016. The options for the areas in County Clare were discussed with the communities between October and early December this year.  By the middle of next year I expect to have the draft plans with feasible solutions for each of the 300 areas, including those in County Clare. The recent flooding event and the possible impact of climate change will inform the flood risk management plan for each area. There will be a further round of public consultations in the second half of 2016, again involving each of the communities to obtain their insight which will inform the final flood risk management plans. I must stress that they will not just be empty plans or glossy reports but will come up with real solutions.  I will reflect on the points made by the Deputy, many of which were reasonable. The issue of relocation may have to be considered in some areas where we are not able to come up with a viable solution. I look forward to responding to further points the Deputy may raise.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	360	I thank the Minister of State for his response. One of the elements that could be undertaken quickly is the construction of flood defence mechanisms around private residences under the minor works scheme. If community groups could be given the chance to work on a solution, I have no doubt, having spent a lot of time with them over the weekend, that they would be happy to do so. The CFRAM study report can inform the management of flooding of the River Shannon at a later stage. Minor flood defence works and the question of relocation must be considered first. The Minister of State has pointed out that tremendous work has been done by the Army and the county council and there are a number of heroes who deserve a special mention. Ms Bridget Kinsella and her three sons stayed up all night to try to protect their home. Bridget is a widow with three teenage sons and thanks to their hard work, they managed to prevent their house from being flooded. I also mention the Masons - Geraldine, her brother, husband and children - who did the same. They managed to save their home, although Geraldine's mother's home was flooded, as was that of her brother, which is a pity.  I pay tribute to some great public servants, including Mr. Hugh McGrath, the area engineer, and Mr. Pat Henchy, who have done tremendous work on behalf of Clare County Council. Mr. Adrian Kelly, the chief fire officer, has also done wonderful work, as have all of the staff who have been working around the clock to save people. Sergeant Mary Daly from the Army also deserves credit for her input on behalf of the Defence Forces, as do local gardaí. The local independent councillor Michael Begley has had a gang of people out filling sandbags and is doing tremendous work in the area.  I must commend all of the neighbours and friends in the area, including Dave and Shirley Mulcahy. While their home has not been under pressure, they have been wading through water in an effort to get their children to school. They are trying to ensure life goes on in the middle of the devastation. They are all great people and it is important to record our thanks for what they have done in the spirit of the community at such a difficult time. It is an especially difficult time for those who will be out of their homes for Christmas. I hope the floods will abate and that nobody else will have to face that prospect.  I wish to make one final point, but, first, I stress that I do not distrust the ESB. In fact, I have the height of respect and the highest regard for ESB engineers and what they have succeeded in doing over the generations. That said, concern has been expressed about whether the ESB is managing the waterways in the best way possible. Under statute, it has one primary concern - the generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha. It is required by law to maintain certain water levels. This is probably a good time to undertake an independent review of the management of the River Shannon in its entirety in the context of how we generate electricity now and will do so into the future. We must determine if we need to maintain the levels deemed necessary in the past and whether we should continue generating electricity in the same way.I pose the questions. I am not an engineer, so I do not know. People would certainly like to see that issue addressed. If that could form part of the Government's mid-term analysis of all of this problem, it would be worthwhile.

I too was struck by the story of the huge ordeal the Kinsella family has gone through and I pay tribute to them for their major efforts. It is important to note that the CFRAM process will reduce the time it takes to deliver a scheme by about two years. Therefore, the work that is being done now, for example, the outline design and the consultation with the community, will reduce a scheme that normally takes about five years to complete to three years. While three years is still a long time, we cannot be dishonest with people. These are major capital schemes that we have to get right. Ireland is on track to deliver its draft CFRAM plans by mid-2016 but we have not been sitting on our hands. We have been moving ahead in delivering a number of schemes, including the scheme for Ennis. The town of Ennis has been the focus of a number of flood relief schemes in recent years, with the completion of the River Fergus, Ennis upper and Ennis lower flood relief schemes. Clare County Council has reported in the media that these schemes have significantly reduced the impact of flooding on the town in recent days. Further works at Aughanteeroe and Fioruisce are currently being undertaken and Clare County Council is progressing a scheme for Ennis south which I expect to commence construction next year. The investment in proactive planning through CFRAM during the past five years for these 300 areas will significantly reduce the delivery times of feasible schemes in these areas. There has been a lot of information about capital spend on flooding. While I do not want to be partisan on this, I want to be clear that the issue of funding in regard to the delivery of these schemes is not a problem. We have €430 million set aside for the next five years under the capital plan. That means we will be spending more on the delivery of these flood relief schemes over the next five years than in the past 20 years, which is right and proper considering the suffering that communities have experienced and the increased frequency of adverse weather events. I want to assure this House and the public that there is, and will continue to be, sufficient funding available to meet all requirements for flood relief in any year. I welcome the proposal by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, which was approved by Cabinet today, to make €8 million available to local authorities, including Clare County Council, in terms of the clean-up costs that will be incurred by communities. I would also make the point that my office continues to run the minor flood works scheme. Clare County Council may carry out flood mitigation works under this heading, whereby it can apply for funding of up to €500,000 to carry out minor works that it may believe will be of benefit to its community. Some €1.56 million has been allocated to Clare County Council under this scheme since it was introduced in 2009 to the end of last year. The Deputy has raised a number of important issues, including, bravely if I may say so, the issue of relocation, which is a sensitive but important issue. When we have concluded the CFRAM process, which will be by about the middle of next year, coupled with the report of the interdepartmental group on flooding to Cabinet, whoever is in government at that time, a range of options and issues, like relocation, flood forecasting and flood insurance, will have to be dealt with. I look forward to debating those issues in this House.

(1)The Authority shall, by order within 12 months of the establishmentday of the Authority, establish a code of ethics that—(a) includes standards of conduct and practice for members,(b) is fully consistent with the policing principles, and(c) encourages and facilitates the reporting of wrongdoing in the Garda Síochána by members.”.We discussed an aspect of the code of ethics earlier. The section regarding the code of ethics was in the 2005 Act but no Minister ever drafted the code of ethics despite the section being framed with the mandatory "shall". The introduction of the trade unions among the bodies the authority is required to consult seems curious as the Minister would not be required to consult with the unions if she had ever drafted the code of ethics under the 2005 Act. There is a requirement to consult the Garda Commissioner as the representative of An Garda Síochána. This we believe would have been sufficient. It is also curious that there is a requirement to consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as setting standards of conduct and policing practice are hardly considered industrial relations issues. There is a reference to the code of ethics being published but it appears that the Garda code is not available for public scrutiny. This seems strange. I noted in the report published last week that the Garda Inspectorate states: The Garda Code provides standard operating processes and procedures for all members of the Garda Síochána, garda staff and student gardaí. It is a comprehensive document and the two volumes extend to almost 1,000 pages. The most recent edition of Volume I (5th) was published in 2005 and replaced a 1995 version.The Code is intended as a mandatory guide for all work activities. Within the Code, a section sets out the generic roles and responsibilities for supervisory ranks. In particular, it highlights that supervisors have the responsibility for ensuring that all members under their supervision are made aware of and understand new policies and procedures.The Code is not the single repository of information and is but one reference point. It is now available in electronic format on the Garda Portal [an internal search engine that the garda members can use to find the most current policy, legal decision or information on a particular issue] and this should provide details of the most up-to-date version of a policy or instruction.During field visits, the Inspectorate was informed that some parts of the Code are now very dated, such as student training and firearms licensing. The Code does not contain details of the date that a particular section was last refreshed or when a section is due to be reviewed. The Inspectorate was unclear as to the value added of retaining the Garda Code, without maintaining an up-to-date version.It is not maintained properly and I am not sure the Garda Inspectorate stated it at any stage but to the best of my knowledge, it is not accessible by the public which should know what is the Garda code. One might say that if it contains 1,000 pages not many will read it but that is not an argument and it should be accessible to those who want to access it. If the Garda Inspectorate states there is not much point in maintaining it unless it is updated, it is very important to maintain it but it also needs to be updated. Hopefully, that will be dealt with in response to the Garda Inspectorate’s report. The biggest problem with the proposed legislation around the code of ethics is that there will be no sanction for breaching the code, which makes it a bit meaningless. If any Minister had ever published the code of ethics, as allowed under the 2005 Act, there was the potential to introduce disciplinary measures. The position now is weaker than the 2005 legislation allowed. It is good that the new code of ethics will be published but it is paramount that some form of disciplinary measures are attached to it.If there are none, I do not think it will change a whole lot. I do not see why anyone should change his or her behaviour if he or she does not have to worry about any sanctions whatsoever. Am I reading the legislation incorrectly? Am I right in saying there is not a disciplinary measure for a breach of the legislation? It would be good if the Minister could explain the rationale behind it. A few weeks ago in the House, the Minister was pretty upset when I suggested that the level of discipline and accountability among some senior gardaí, although not all, left a lot to be desired. I said it was leading to problems in the force. I found it interesting that within days, the Garda Inspectorate report referred to much the same and did not disagree with what I said on the matter. It should be pointed out that the code of ethics in Northern Ireland has a much stronger status and is the standard against which police officers are measured when an allegation of misconduct is made. The code of ethics there is drafted by its board but has a much stronger focus on human rights obligations - for example, the European Convention on Human Rights and UN codes - than the proposed one in this Government's Bill. The chief constable in the North is obliged to ensure that all officers have read and understand the code. This requirement was in the heads regarding our authority but has been removed from the final draft. Also, the policing principles in the North set out that when carrying out their functions, police must be guided by the code of ethics, giving the code added status. The board also includes an assessment in its annual report as to the performance of the police in this regard, which is significant. It has been pointed out by one professor that the legislation removes a function of the authority published in the heads, back in November 2014, relating to human rights and policing. In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin's explanation was that human rights in policing are more properly addressed by the IHRC than by the proposed authority. I do not really accept that stands up to much scrutiny, as the Northern Ireland Policing Board has a principal function of monitoring and supervising compliance with human rights standards in policing, which co-exists with the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. The Minister will recall that Professor Dermot Walsh was adamant that the failure to human rights proof all aspects of policing is a challenge to An Garda Síochána and a challenge to how we do policing in Ireland. It is something the Minister should reconsider.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	418	This is probably one of the key aspects of the Bill but it is a much watered down version of what we thought would be in the legislation. It is in sharp contrast to the legislation Deputy Wallace published for a genuinely independent Garda authority, which was allowed to go to Second Stage. That Bill proposed that the board and the Commissioner would be responsible for drafting a code of ethics for the Minister to establish by regulation, with the approval of the board. In addition, a code of service would be drawn up setting out standards of efficiency and service that the public could expect from gardaí. This is important because complaints in that vein cannot currently be made to GSOC. This is a critical section. In the press releases the Minister sent out more than a year ago, it was lauded as a great step forward but as Deputy Wallace said, the code of ethics was always there under the 2005 Act. It is just that successive Ministers chose not to implement it. As regards this pre-existing code, the Minister is saying she will bring it in but no disciplinary sanction will be in place for violating it, which makes it utterly ludicrous. The Bill states that the authority will draw up a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct, practice for members and internal whistleblowing provisions. However, these will have to be done with a range of bodies such as the unions, as Deputy Wallace pointed out earlier. The problems that have got us to this stage mean the dogs on the street know we need an independent Garda authority. One of the reasons for that was precisely due to the lack of adequate provision for, and measures concerning, Garda whistleblowers.  As recently as two weeks ago, Deputy Wallace put these questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality under the so-called new Garda Síochána, with a new Minister and a new Garda Commissioner, albeit 18 months old so not really that new. In fact, the current treatment of whistleblowers is absolutely dire. Subsequently, the position of Garda Keith Harrison has been vindicated by the State pulling out of a High Court action it had taken against him at enormous personal and emotional cost, not to mind the cost to the taxpayer of a ludicrous, vindictive action. It is worth saying that the judge in that case was the senior counsel during the Morris tribunal. It is quite clear that from his stance, nothing has really changed in the sense that he awarded full costs to Garda Harrison. This is important because why else are we here discussing a policing authority? It is to have independent scrutiny and accountability of the gardaí. Unfortunately, however, that is not something that we are getting in the present arrangement. It was worrying to hear the reports on RTE radio on Sunday which referenced the fact that - subsequent to Deputy Wallace's intervention with the Minister the last time, when she could not say strongly enough how great the new Garda regime was - Garda whistleblowers were being frustrated, including by a lack of information being given to that garda's legal team. It was only as a result of those matters being raised here that files were released by the Garda and sent to GSOC. Given the current treatment of decent serving gardaí by senior management, there is clear and indisputable evidence of harassment and demonisation undermining their position. It is quite clear, therefore, ethics are lacking. We need a system in place so that it can be properly dealt with. We also need to examine the whole area of human rights proofing. It is ridiculous that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, went to the Seanad and said that human rights stuff would be better off with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. That body, the Minister's own watchdog, contributed to this Bill. In its observation, it said there should be disciplinary sanction. It said the role of the authority should be to authorise disciplinary sanction over senior gardaí. If we do not have this system of ethics properly established, then we will have a serious problem.  It would be entirely appropriate for the Minister to comment on the Garda Inspectorate's report which has obviously shocked people. It has also vindicated everything we have said - that nothing has changed inside the ranks of the Garda Síochána, except the faces at the top. I am surprised that people have not called for the current Garda Commissioner to resign because she is standing over a situation that is at least as bad, if not worse, than what the former Commissioner Callanan stood over. It is worse because the scale of the knowledge that is in the public domain has not been addressed. The previous Garda Inspectorate's report gave a damning account of gardaí massaging the crime figures, for example. That resulted in the analysis of crime figures having to be withdrawn for a period. It is a very serious matter. We know for a fact that the massaging of the figures is still continuing. In recent weeks, in Superintendent Pat Murray's station in the midlands and in Athlone, we have seen direct evidence of at least eight cases where crimes were written down so that the original crime was reclassified as a more minor matter. There is clear evidence of massaging the figures - for example, changing burglaries to criminal damage, which is reclassification.It is a very serious situation and the Garda Inspectorate was clear that there is a lawlessness out there that is not being addressed. To do that, we need a strong code of ethics with strong human rights at its centre. It is really regrettable that is not present in the Bill. The board should assess these matters annually as well as sanction. One of the reasons for such indiscipline at senior levels in the force, which is creating major demoralisation further down the ranks, is that nobody at senior management levels is being called to account for their actions. The points we have made previously about how people get promoted jar very much with ordinary decent members of the force. We think this is a critical part of the Bill. What we are getting under the Bill, far from being a beefed-up code of ethics, is a watering down of a provision the Minister decided not to act on previously and it is critical if we are to really reform this.  I would like to hear the Minister comment on the points made by Deputy Wallace about why there is a need to consult with the Garda representative bodies and even more curiously the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I am not sure what his role in human rights proofing of An Garda Síochána is or where that fits in. This gets to the heart of much of what we are talking about. Why are we discussing a Garda authority Bill? It is because of the crisis in policing that occurred. New evidence in the latest Garda Inspectorate report indicates that those problems are there. As the Minister knows well, the hundreds of historical cases of Garda malpractice that had not been addressed and which landed on her desk show why we need a code of ethics. In that context, I was utterly shocked to receive a copy of the letter her office sent to Cynthia Owens on her case, which had been through that review mechanism. That review acknowledged deficiencies in Garda work. Exhibits, including the DNA on her murdered baby, were destroyed and lost. The internal review mechanism refers to a discredited review that was conducted into her case, a review which ignored and disagreed with the findings of the inquest which confirmed that she was the mother of baby Noeleen. The Minister's independent review mechanism relied on the person who carried out that review to tell that woman that nothing further would be done in her case. It is utter madness. We have now had two independent reviews into her case. Neither of them bothered to interview the woman who was the victim of a paedophile ring, which she has alleged involved three gardaí as participants, making it very strange but relevant that exhibits then later go missing in that case. She was not even corresponded with. This is a serious problem and it will not go away just because those people have been told their cases got nowhere. These are the reasons a policing authority was put centre stage and they remain. Sadly, the measures the Minister has introduced in the Bill will not address such behaviour. If those who stand over these practices at the top are still there, why would a middle or lower ranking garda even bother to try to do their best?

I was also alarmed to learn from the Garda Inspectorate report that even though a code of ethics was signposted in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, it is still not in place ten years later. I am sure the Minister will agree that report was a damning indictment of the repeated failure of the management of An Garda Síochána to implement recommendations from, not just Garda Inspectorate reports, but also a range of other inquiries, reviews and investigations over recent years. We are repeatedly told that they accept the recommendations in these reports but the recommendations are not being implemented. It was a damning indictment of the failure of the management of An Garda Síochána to act. The report was superb. I am also conscious that the Garda Inspectorate published a report on penalty points. In recent days, it has been brought to my attention that a considerable number of members of An Garda Síochána are still avoiding penalty points by utilising what is called a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. The Minister and I, along with all citizens, would agree this should apply for a garda driving a Garda vehicle or their own vehicle while pursuing somebody engaged in the act of criminality. We can accept there are circumstances when gardaí have to use either his or her own vehicle or more likely a Garda vehicle. My understanding is that on none of the occasions when these members of An Garda Síochána had points terminated under statutory exemption for emergency vehicles measure did they prove they were using the vehicle in question for that reason. They are beating the rap unlike every other citizen. It was brought to my attention that a senior member of An Garda Síochána has repeatedly had penalty points terminated, even including in the middle of this year, 2015. I have seen the evidence with my own eyes. This senior member of An Garda Síochána claimed he was driving the vehicle under the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. He is a repeat offender who, as far as I can see, has never had penalty points allocated. Here we are at the end of 2015 and the Minister has stood up in this Chamber and given us assurances that the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Comptroller and Auditor General and others would be implemented by An Garda Síochána. On the basis of the information I have just given, will the Minister undertake an immediate review of all terminations of penalty points that are categorised a statutory exemption for emergency vehicles to ensure that they were genuinely using the vehicle to prevent a crime, with paperwork to back it up? I also ask the Minister to implement the recommendations that came through the Garda professional standards unit. There were two key recommendations. One was an evader unit to be set up to track the PULSE system to look at people who had points repeatedly terminated, be they members of An Garda Síochána or other citizens. The second was to have the statutory exemption issue dealt with. That is just one example and I could give the Minister many others where we have been assured that change is on the way and that recommendations will be implemented. Let us consider the three-year investigation of crime work, a milestone examination by the Garda Inspectorate. How many of those recommendations have been implemented? The Garda Inspectorate report, Changing Policing in Ireland, made 12 key recommendations, only two of which have been implemented. Unfortunately, there has been a refusal by management of An Garda Síochána to implement recommendations for change by the Garda Inspectorate and others. Here is my problem with all this. With the guidance of her officials, the Minister has decided to disempower the new policing authority from being as independent as it could be. I will give some examples. The Commissioner and deputy commissioner will be appointed and removed by Government. The Commissioner is accountable to Government. It has been stated that the Commissioner will remain accountable to Government on matters of national security but I say respectfully that is not accurate. The original provision on accountability is not altered. The Commissioner will remain accountable to the Minister for the performance of the Commissioner's functions and those of the Garda Síochána. This concerns all aspects of policing and not just national security. Policing plans, strategies and priorities must be confirmed by Government. Security priorities will be set by Government. The budget is determined by Government. The Minister can demand any documents of An Garda Síochána. The Minister can issue written directives to An Garda Síochána and to the authority. CCTV schemes must be approved by the Minister. Ministerial consent is required for GSOC to investigate the Commissioner. The Minister decides the number of senior rank positions. The Minister gives consent on the number of civilian staff, the appointment of members to the audit committee and the appointment of the CEO of the authority. The Minister decides what constitutes State security. Government consent is required for the Garda to work with a police service in another state.The Minister authorises delegation of the Commissioner's functions to the deputy commissioner. The Minister can appoint someone to inquire into any aspect of policing and statistical information on crime compiled by An Garda Síochána is to go the Minister and not to the authority. I could go on. Last week’s Garda Inspectorate report was a devastating report in terms of its implications for the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas to oversee An Garda Síochána. That is the reason we need a truly independent policing authority with the teeth to ensure that An Garda Síochána management oversees the change that is required. Frankly, the Government has failed again and again. I genuinely am shocked to learn that we do not have a cast iron penalty points system in spite of reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Garda Inspectorate, the PAC and everything we said about the penalty points system. We do not have a penalty points system that ensures whether one is a member of An Garda Síochána or a citizen that if one has been speeding there are only two grounds on which one would have the points terminated, namely, if one was bringing a family member to hospital in an emergency, with the necessary paperwork from the hospital to prove that was the case, and that members of An Garda Síochána would have to prove by means of a report on the PULSE system that they were in pursuit of criminals or suspected criminals in a vehicle. One would not just have the speeding charge waived. Garda management is failing to ensure the change that is required is being delivered even on that issue. That is why we need a genuinely independent policing authority with teeth and the ability to hold Garda management to account. The men and women of An Garda Síochána who are trying to do their job are being failed even more than any of us in these Houses. They are without leadership and the clear direction they require. At times they have issued penalty points only to see them terminated by a senior colleague for some derisory reason. That is why I am so disappointed with what we have seen in terms of the dilution of the authority. We have a conservative Department of Justice and Equality that has interpreted the Constitution in a conservative way to say that the Constitution which rightly gives authority to the Executive to protect the security of the State must be extended and interpreted to include all policing matters. The Garda Síochána, the police of this State, oversee security and policing. Because of that unique situation, the Department has interpreted the Constitution to give the Cabinet the power to continue to control policing to an extent that is not necessary. Given the information I and other Opposition colleagues have given the Minister and last week’s damning Garda Inspectorate report that repeatedly refers to the failure of Garda management to implement recommendations for change, will the Minister please reconsider her response to Opposition amendments? Will she please give the policing authority the independence it needs to hold An Garda Síochána to account, to make sure that we have genuinely learnt the lessons of all the scandals of recent years and that there is a new beginning to policing and that we have a police service that the men and women of An Garda Síochána can be proud of and want to serve every day, and in which we the people across the State can have true faith? I am shocked to learn what I did about penalty points. I have seen written evidence that some members of An Garda Síochána can still get off with speeding. In one case, a senior member of An Garda Síochána, who has repeatedly come into the system, in the middle of this year beat the rap due to the loophole that exists. The Minister must put a stop to that. I know she wants to, but she must now show authority and deal with the issue and call an immediate review of the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles. The Minister must ensure that every case that is registered on the system is examined to see whether there is paperwork to prove the vehicle was genuinely used to protect the public or if the driver was abusing the penalty points system, which I believe happens. Some gardaí believe they are higher, more powerful and more entitled than other citizens. After everything we have been through, that is a scandal and the Minister must put a stop to it in the absence of an independent policing authority. Next year I want an independent policing authority to do that but in the absence of such an authority being in place the Minister still has the power and she must call in the Garda Commissioner tomorrow and ask why she has not implemented the recommendations of all the Garda Inspectorate reports and why after everything we have been through with penalty points some gardaí still believe they are above the law. That is the challenge I set down for the Minister. I believe the Minister is genuine about her office. She must now take the opportunity to deal with this issue once and for all and send the message out to the brave whistleblowers who have taken a stand on this issue and to the Garda Inspectorate, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the members of the Committee of Public Accounts and the likes of Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly and others who have championed the cause and exposed this issue that it will be dealt with once and for all.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	420	If Deputy Mac Lochlainn has evidence of what he has just put before the Dáil, I would like him to give it to me because the matters to which he referred were one of the key issues we took seriously when we examined the penalty points reports. The Director of Public Prosecutions is to evaluate applications for cancellation made by a garda to avail of the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles where the garda is driving a private vehicle in the course of his or her duties. If Deputy Mac Lochlainn has evidence that somebody of a senior rank is abusing the system, I would like to have the evidence and I am sure the Commissioner would like to have that evidence. I assure the Deputy it will be followed up and examined because we have taken a whole series of initiatives and operationally the Garda has taken a whole series of initiatives. We took decisions at a policy level in government and we continue to work on the range of points that were made. I remind the Deputy that only three people are now authorised to cancel fixed charge notices under the new policy. That system is in operation. I also appointed a judge to oversee what was happening in that office. All of the other areas where recommendations were made for change were accepted by the Commissioner and were implemented. If for some reason Deputy Mac Lochlainn believes the opposite to be the case and he has evidence to that effect I would like to see it. I will follow it up and I have no doubt that the Garda Commissioner will follow it up operationally. I say the same to Deputy Wallace. If he has evidence of wrongdoing in the particular station he has just mentioned he should please supply the evidence because it needs to be followed up. In terms of ethics, I do not accept the way the Garda authority has been described by any of the previous speakers. The authority will provide a new independent and dedicated forum for the public oversight of policing services. It will be a new engine to drive policing reforms and practices under the chair, Josephine Feehily, and the board and staff that will be appointed. The authority will ensure that An Garda Síochána is fit to address the ongoing and emerging challenges of modern policing. If one looks at the history of policing in this country it is a quite radical reform to have a new, independent policing authority made up the way it is with a chair, a strong board and staff with the authority we have given it. Let me remind Deputies of the authority it has. It has authority to oversee the performance by the Garda Síochána of its policing functions under a broad range of headings. I will return to some of the points that were made about the role of Government. The authority has power to nominate persons for appointment by the Government to the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner, to appoint persons to the rank of Garda superintendent, chief superintendent and assistant commissioner and to remove them for reasons related to policing services. That is a very strong power for a police authority to have. The authority can also appoint persons to senior positions within the Garda civilian staff, determine Garda priorities on policing services, approve the three year Garda strategy statement, approve the annual Garda policing plan, establish a Garda code of ethics – I will return to the points that have been made about that – and the authority’s general goal to promote and support the continuous improvement of policing in the State.Of course, there is work to be done and the Garda Inspectorate reports have shown that. I could give the Deputies a list of the initiatives that have already been taken in regard to the last Garda Inspectorate report, on which we had a detailed discussion here. Changes have been made in regard to data and the PULSE system. The commitment by the Government to the IT system will mean that already by the end of this year we will not only we have crime being reported on the PULSE system but we will have the investigation of crime on that system because money has been made available for the system that is needed. Next year, because of the investment that is being made, we will have the whole human resources system in place for the first time. It is not acceptable that this will be in place for first time but this was not dealt with during all the years of the Celtic tiger economy. This will be dealt with next year because the funding is available, the tenders have gone out and the decisions have been made that will ensure the Garda has the types of systems it needs in place to have effective policing and the proper deployment of resources. It is multifactorial. The Garda Inspectorate obviously has highlighted the ongoing work that is needed. The Garda Commissioner will be giving her response to that and has already implemented quite a number of the suggestions in the current report. I would mention the focus groups and the work that was done with the members of An Garda Síochána, and a good deal of work was done with them by the Garda Inspectorate. It is worth keeping in mind that this was done two years ago. Quite a number of changes in regard to policing have been made, as we know, within the last year and half or so, and we should be conscious of that. In regard to the role of Government and the various elements of the Bill, I want to put on record the point about the constitutional responsibilities of Government. I said previously that the legal situation is that as a matter of practice, as a matter of custom and as a matter of proper constitutional interpretation, the function of the Garda Síochána in the exercise of the policing power of this State has been interpreted by the courts as a function that is exercised as part of the executive power of the State. One does not just take that away. What we have done is crafted the Bill recognising that constitutional reality. While an executive power of the Government under Article 28.2o can be delegated it would not be constitutionally permissible for such a delegation to amount to an abdication of the Government's executive power. I put it to the Deputies that there are not too many Deputies in this House who, if questions or issues arose in relation to policing, would not want a Minister for Justice and Equality to come in here and respond to the queries one might have at that time, be it to do with the security issues we see at present or other operations. I want to emphasise that the exercise of the policing function is an aspect of the executive power of the State. Many of the amendments proposed to this Bill, on which we have just voted, would remove from the Government the ability to comply with the constitutional duties in regard to the exercise of that power and that, in itself, would be unconstitutional. The Deputies may not accept that but that is the situation. I am not going to put a Bill before the House that is unconstitutional. In the development of the police authority, we have managed that balance in a way that ensures we have a strong authority with significant powers and significant opportunity to show to the public in terms of bringing in the Garda Commissioner and senior management and questioning them on the various priorities, their strategies and the various operations they are undertaking. Obviously, the gardaí get on with the operational aspects but we will have an independent policing authority that can hold meetings in public. That has been forgotten in the debate as well. It can have public hearings in regard to whatever topic it requires. I want to talk about the code of ethics. It is surprising to say the least that no code of ethics has been established to date. There were obviously difficulties before my time in this office in producing that code and I want to say a few words about that. The requirement for the establishment, by way of regulations, of the code led to alignment difficulties with the strict provisions of the disciplinary regulations. Let us keep in mind that we have disciplinary regulations. In effect, there could be two sets of what could be described as disciplinary regulations, given that a breach of the code was intended to be a disciplinary matter. I do not accept either the point made by Deputy Wallace or by Deputy Clare Daly that this represents a watering down of the code. It does not and I will tell the Deputies why but I will first conclude my point. This would be, notwithstanding the fact the behaviour that could constitute such a breach would of itself be a disciplinary matter under the disciplinary regulations and so that would not lead to an effective disciplinary process. If the Deputies read section 16, they will see what we will have. For the first time within 12 months of the establishment day of the new policing authority it will establish a code of ethics. That is a very important statement. It is a clear priority for the policing authority to establish a code of ethics within 12 months. If we read the detail, we note it will look at the standards of conduct and practice for members and provisions to encourage and facilitate the reporting by members of wrongdoing in the Garda Síochána. There is a range of people with which it will consult, which is a very good idea. I see nothing wrong with the range of people it is consulting. A point has been made about human rights. Obviously, the authority will consult the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission but of course it is open to an independent policing authority to examine human rights issues all of the time in its work. Of course it will do that. I take the point made by one of the Deputies about human rights standards and how important they are but I want to put a few points on record in regard to the Garda. As that Deputy said, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, made the point that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is already fulfilling its function in respect of the Garda Síochána and other organisations, but let us consider what is happening at the moment. Section 16 of the 2005 Act provides a revised form of declaration for persons joining the force, which specifically directs each new member to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties. That is contained in the 2005 Act, namely, the importance of human rights in carrying out policing duties. Garda training now incorporates human rights. Detailed information has been given to every member of An Garda Síochána about, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. The information that has been given to every Garda in the country outlines the key principles of human rights obligations as they apply to operational policing. Of course that needs monitoring but let us not pretend that human rights do not feature in Garda training or in the operational instructions that they have or that it is not provided for under the Act. It is contained there - that is the reality. There is also a Garda declaration of professional values and ethical standards. That has been published and worked on with members of the force. Human rights compliance is at the heart of the strategy statement for 2013 to 2015. Let us not pretend it is not there: it is at the heart of it. I am not saying that having something in guidance such as that means it will be implemented, and of course we must have ongoing monitoring, but it is certainly open to the Garda authority to do that. All operational Garda directives now make reference to the human rights principles applicable to the relevant instruction so as to remind all members of the force of their obligations in this area. The new training programme for Garda recruits, the BA in applied policing programme, incorporates human rights training, and training in human rights is also part of the ongoing professional development for members. There is a whole range of areas where at a practical, ongoing training and operational level human rights is at the centre, as it should be, and I agree with that. In developing a code of ethics, the authority will consult with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Ombudsman Commission and others, as is appropriate. The policing authority will be established on 1 January 2016 and within 12 months, there will be a code of ethics for the first time, which will not be watered down.The behaviour that would constitute a breach of the code is a disciplinary matter. Thus, the practical effect of misbehaviour is dealt with, in the disciplinary regulations. Making the breach a disciplinary matter would not alter the position that is comprehended by the disciplinary regulations. Minor infractions are liable to the regulations and more serious infractions are also dealt with under them. Behaviour that would amount to a breach of a code of ethics is, therefore, clearly comprehended by the regulations. For all those reasons, this is a step forward and not backwards, as the Deputy said. There are implications to a breach of the code of ethics, which would be comprehended by the disciplinary regulations, and there will be an independent body for the first time working and consulting with a variety of people before the work is completed. The Deputy also raised a question about civilians. There are civilians in the organisation and it seems reasonable to have them liaise with the various representative associations. I do not see why they would be excluded. For all those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments. I am satisfied that the policy objective relating to the code of ethics is achieved in the legislation. Under section 16 of the principal Act, every member of the force declares that he or she will faithfully discharge the duties of a member with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality upholding the Constitution and the law, according equal respect to all people and discharging his or her duties according to the law. That statement is an intention to act ethically. No more than in other areas of life, proper and good management is essential to be continually rigorous in the monitoring of behaviour. There have been failings but we are determined with the range of reforms that have been introduced that there will be ongoing improvements and ongoing implementation of the inspectorate report. That is helped by the position we are in where because of the fact we have a stable economy, we can invest in the Garda and give members the resources that will help them do the job properly. That includes recruitment, the vehicles they need to do their jobs effectively and efficiently around the country, having the appropriate specialists and increasing civilianisation in order that gardaí can be removed from doing jobs that are not appropriate to them, as the inspectorate report says, which should be done by other staff. Clearly, short, medium and long-term initiatives are required to respond to the inspectorate report. The disciplinary process in An Garda Síochána is formalised and grounded in regulation. Those are the main points I want to make in response to the various issues raised.

Tomorrow morning, I will give the Minister proof of district officer, Superintendent Pat Murray, reclassifying crime figures. This is an individual who has harassed and bullied a Garda whistleblower to an awful degree for a long time. The Minister pointed out that we should not pretend that human rights are not part of Garda training. It takes much longer to become a hairdresser than a member of An Garda Síochána. In my opinion, and I am not alone, more training of gardaí is required, better resourcing of the organisation is required and better pay for members is also required. The Minister cited Article 28 as one of the reasons for the inability to introduce depoliticised policing, claiming that there are restrictions on the extent to which it is open to the Government to delegate important functions relating to the executive power of the State to another body. In particular, this reference to the Constitution has been used to justify the fact that the Garda Commissioner remains exclusively accountable to the Minister rather than to the authority in contrast to the clear transfer of accountability promised in the heads of legislation in November 2014. Throughout the Bill, the structure is the same. The Commissioner is accountable to the Minister and the authority must run everything past the Minister and obey him or her at all times. If the Constitution can be used to make sure that we have a police force that is not accountable to the people, then it should be called into question. As has been argued by many legal scholars, it is difficult to address this reference to the Constitution as the Minister failed to inform the public what specific part of Article 28 she is referring to. She said the proposals in the Bill had been prepared in close consultation with the Attorney General. Will she please publish the advice of the Attorney General? She also stated her position on Article 28 was based on an interpretation by the courts. Will she inform the House of the case or cases to which she is referring to in order that we can at least attempt to understand and assess her line of reasoning? Did she specifically request senior counsel advice on this Bill? If so, when?

It has been watered down and removed from the final draft. The Minister also mentioned the importance of monitoring but the word is mentioned only once in regard to the role of the authority. It has been removed from what was in the heads of Bill to a much looser oversight role, which is again a watering down. She can say there is human rights compliance in a pledge, but where is it in reality? Where were the human rights of Keith Harrison, a member of the Garda? Senior management pressurised his girlfriend into making a complaint against him. He had to go to the High Court to stop the action taken against him in that regard. The Garda representatives frustrated that action and the State ended up paying the costs of the case. Who will be held to account for the breach of human rights of that whistleblower? The Minister has staunchly defended time and again the force when the Garda Inspectorate is on record as saying there are serious problems. She said the force is acting on the recommendations of the previous report but the inspectorate says the opposite. The information we are talking about in the Athlone district and the continued massaging of the crime figures is fact. I do not know why she is surprised by the information given by Deputy Mac Lochlainn because it fits in with what the Garda Inspectorate said about a systemic problem at the top of An Garda Síochána. I might not generally be a fan of the GRA or the AGSI but, this time around, the inspectorate complimented them for highlighting the problems at the top of the organisation. How can the Minister reform an organisation if she keeps the people at the top who were at the top when the problems emerged? The systemic problem remains and they are not being addressed. She is not giving the authority the power it needs to grapple with it. Deputy Wallace made a number of points about the Government hiding behind the Constitution yet again, which is a little nauseating. We need answers to those serious questions that were raised about the Attorney General's role and her advice. Can we see the advice? If it was that black and white, why did the Government not change the Constitution in this regard when it had the opportunity with all the other referendums? The idea of an independent Garda authority is a little more important than the age to run in a presidential election and so on.These are very serious issues and every time we raise them here, new information comes out. I am shocked that the Minister is not willing to say on record now that it is a disgrace that it was not until Deputy Wallace went on record in the House that the Garda authorities handed over the files on the case of Keith Harrison to GSOC. That is what happened. We are dealing with a force which is undisciplined at the top and this Bill will not equip an authority to deal with it properly.

In January, the GPSU completed its audit, which examined the issue of statutory exemptions of emergency vehicles that allowed members of the Garda Síochána to avoid penalty points. It considered both the latter and the issue of an evader unit. I am asking the Minister to immediately ask the Garda Inspectorate to review all terminations of penalty points based on statutory exemption of emergency vehicles to ensure they are terminated properly. I will not name the senior garda I mentioned; he is a superintendent and has had three terminations of penalty points. He was listed for eight separate offences and I do not see any evidence he has accepted or been issued with penalty points for any of those. On three occasions prior to 2015, he had penalty points terminated at different locations. He has also had penalty points terminated in 2015. I am pretty certain he did not incur those in the pursuit of somebody involved in criminality. I am happy to co-operate with the Garda Inspectorate and pass on the evidence I have on the superintendent in question. That garda has had penalty points terminated on four separate occasions since 2009 and possibly more on which summonses were not issued when he should have gone to court and faced the appropriate charges. If the Minister is so confident there is nothing to fear, will she ask for the Garda Inspectorate to be immediately allowed access to the PULSE system to review all terminations in 2015 made on the basis of statutory exemption of emergency vehicles to ensure every one was in order and occurred when a garda was in pursuit of a criminal. We would all accept it is absolutely fine to have penalty points terminated in those circumstances. Those are the issues. I ask the Minister to show evidence of how she or a predecessor have accepted and implemented the recommendations made by the Garda Inspectorate over a number of years. The particular focus tonight is on penalty points.

I will remind him of the facts. In the interest of maintaining public confidence in the penalty points system, I put in place a further assurance and oversight mechanism, which I mentioned earlier. I appointed Judge Matthew Deery, former president of the Circuit Court, to act as an independent oversight authority of any cancellations and to look at the process. That role was created in addition to the ongoing internal audit. The judge is free to inspect at random any fixed charge notice cancellation and report his or her findings on the operation of the system to me. I put that in place and the Deputy will remember that we discussed it at committee and here in the House. I will receive his first annual report at the end of the year. I respect that the Deputy is saying he has this information but I do not believe he should under-emphasise the amount of work that has been done to change the system. We have discussed the radical changes to the operation of the penalty points system at committee, in particular the new criteria and the decrease in the number of people making decisions to three. These are in addition to the oversight that has been added and the internal audit. Those points are very important because that can be forgotten as a result of the focus the Deputy is placing on one particular person. It would not be acceptable if it was true and if there was not a good reason for it, namely, if it was not an emergency. I will have that report quite shortly, the purpose of which is to do the very thing the Deputy is requesting, namely, to have oversight and ongoing monitoring. If one puts a judge in and asks him to look at cancellations at random and how the system is operating and report on it, that is a good monitoring system. We will see what information the Deputy possesses. Most fixed charges are being paid without recourse to court. Approximately 300,000 fixed charge notices for penalty offences are now issued per annum with an approximate overall payment rate of nearly 80%. We are also pursuing those people through the courts, for example, those who do not produce licences, and there are various other initiatives which we have discussed in another arena. Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace have a particular view on the Constitution and interpretation of it but we obtained the advice of senior counsel on this. The Constitution states, "The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government." That is precisely the point I have been elaborating on here - the implications of that constitutional provision.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-15 00:00:00	Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage	427	Ireland has a highly unusual degree of centralised control over its police service. As it stands, the Bill does not do much to change that or to change the politicisation of policing in Ireland. The Bill contains 137 references to the Minister, which is odd in legislation designed to facilitate an independent policing authority. A truly independent authority would determine and revise the priorities of the Garda Síochána without constantly having to get the approval of the Minister of the day. In Sweden, all Government authorities have enjoyed a high level of independence since 1974. Neither the Swedish Government nor individual Ministers have the right to influence the implementation of legislation or how an agency decides in a particular case. The proposed authority is only independent in the performance of its functions subject to the Act. However, according to the Act, all of the authority's powers and functions are either shared with or subject to the approval or consent of the Minister or Government. The Minister can issue directives or orders to the authority and the authority "shall comply" with these and "shall" set out to the Minister how it has complied with them. The Minister retains sole and exclusive powers and functions in many respects and often a full veto over the authority's powers. Therefore, political power over policing has not been relinquished. This is not comparable to the real independence and strength of other statutory bodies such as the IHREC or the Ombudsman, who answers solely to Oireachtas committees. The Garda Commissioner remains exclusively accountable to the Minister rather than to the authority in contrast to the clear transfer of accountability promised in the heads of legislation published by the Minister in November 2014. We had the same Constitution in November 2014 as we have now.Why were these provisions included in the heads of the Bill given that the Constitution has not changed? Appointment of the Garda Commissioner remains solely the function of Government on the nomination of the authority of the person selected by the Public Appointments Service. The Minister alone will have the power to issue directives to the Garda Commissioner, compelling him or her to take particular action. The authority does not have the power to issue a directive, including a policy directive, to the Garda Commissioner or An Garda Síochána in general. The proposed legislation is deceptive in that it provides that the authority will have the power to appoint assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents. This power is also subject to the 2006 and 2014 regulations, which provide for the promotions advisory council and a detailed selection process by panels containing nominees from the Minister and the Garda Commissioner. It is clear that the authority's power in this regard will be merely a rubber-stamping of the nominee already selected. The proposed arrangements regarding national security are neither impartial nor transparent as the Minister is proposed as the sole and final arbiter in any dispute on policing and national security. The definition of "national security" is impossibly broad and may contravene the requirements under the European Convention on Human Rights in this regard. This section is likely also unconstitutional as it permits the Minister to decide what is lawful and unlawful regarding the definition of "lawful protest". Under Bunreacht na hÉireann only the courts are permitted to decide what is lawful or unlawful. It is difficult, in the context of all the issues that have arisen in this area and the promises made in relation to reform and how things would be done differently, to credit that such an abysmal Bill is being put through this House. This is abysmal and disappointing legislation.

Ba mhaith liom an Bille um Fhorbairt Ceathrú 1916 2015 a mholadh don Teach. Beimid ag déanamh comóradh ar Éirí Amach na Cásca agus ar chéad bliain ón Éirí Amach sin an bhliain seo chugainn. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go ndéanfadh muid comóradh agus ceiliúradh ceart ar an Éirí Amach. Bhí go leor cainte ar an Éirí Amach ach go minic bíonn easpa tuisceana ar thábhacht an Éirí Amach, ní hamháin i stair na tíre seo, ach i stair an domhain. Bíonn daoine ag rá go bhféadfaí saoirse a bhaint amach ar bhealaí eile. Faraor géar, níl sé sin fíor.  I recommend the 1916 Quarter Development Bill to the House. I believe the Bill is important as next year we commemorate and celebrate the 1916 Rising. I think it is very important that we leave a permanent legacy to the generations to come in terms of how we commemorate the Rising. Before I come to the details of the Bill, I would like to put the 1916 Rising in context. The 1916 Rising is often taken in its military context and obviously that is very important and is in a certain way the subject of the Bill because what we are seeking to preserve are the sites at which the Rising took place. However, to see the Rising in purely military terms is to underestimate the seismic change that came about as a result of the Rising, the legacy that those who survived the Rising took from the Rising and how they went on to build on the Rising in subsequent years. The world of 1916 was a world in which the British empire dominated on the world scene and where any map of the world would show that the influence of the British empire literally spread across all of the continents. In that context, a very small number of people decided that the only way they could break that empire's grip in this country would be to stage a rising. They believed that, in the events that had happened leading into the First World War and the opposition to home rule, even home rule itself would not come rapidly. Of course, what they aspired to, and what I think history proved the Irish people aspired to, was full independence. I have always believed that 1916 must be taken in the context of 1919 but it also must be taken in the context of the demise of the British Empire in the following 100 years. The story is recorded that, when the negotiations started in 1921 and Éamon de Valera went over to meet Lloyd George, he had a huge map of the empire and, to try to intimidate de Valera, he asked how little Ireland could stand out against all of this. The reply given was that de Valera would see, within his own lifetime, the demise of that empire. In fact, he did largely see the demise of that empire within his lifetime. However, it is fair to say that what happened in Ireland was the first stone taken out of the edifice - it was the first block removed that made the rest crumble. Therefore, 1916 is a world-important event. Anybody who has had any contact with people who were involved in Indian independence will say that the leaders of India took massive inspiration from the independence movement in Ireland in what they were seeking to do. It is only when we look at 1916 in this wider context that it becomes absolutely imperative that we respect the heritage we have inherited. As I said, to think of 1916 just as an event of a week or a few weeks is, in my view, to misunderstand exactly what happened. The leaders of the Rising knew, because of the countermanding order and the loss of the shipment of arms on the Aud, that militarily they could not succeed. However, what they also knew was that by making a stand, they would be able to influence and embolden public opinion and encourage people to look for their just rights, as an independent nation, and to believe they could get them. When we look at 1916, I always believe we cannot do so without looking at the 1918 election and the setting up of the First Dáil. For those who say that 1916 did not have a democratic mandate, they have to look at the first opportunity in a full franchise of men and women that was given after the Rising, in that the Rising got an overwhelming endorsement not only in 1918 but in the subsequent election of 1920. Therefore, to read the 1918 election purely in terms of conscription is, in my view, to miss the point. Why is the Dáil so important? It is important because we sit in this Dáil and this Dáil takes its numbers from the First Dáil and claims to be the successor of that First Dáil. Let us remember that of the people who were behind the setting up of the Dáil, many were either veterans or relatives of veterans of 1916. The inspiration for the First Dáil, a democratic assembly of the Irish people, free and independent, took its inspiration from 1916. When people talk about the military side of it, they often forget that the Proclamation talks about a government elected by its men and women. They did not see a government set up by military action as being the ideal one; they were very clear they wanted a government and a Dáil elected by the people. At the first opportunity they got, because they were the same people, they set up that Parliament. One of the extraordinary achievements of this nation is that it is, to my knowledge, the first country that undermined the rule of another country by literally replacing its administration with an alternative administration that had the will of the people. When we talk about the 1919-21 period, we often talk about the War of Independence but what we often ignore is that a proper Parliament was set up.Amazingly, with the election taking place at the end of November or beginning of December, they managed to set up a Parliament. Nowadays, if we were doing that, we would have about five commissions and there would be ten years of a delay. They set up a Parliament on 21 January, although many of the leaders were in prison. If we look at the Dáil record, we will find that every debate that took place in that Parliament was reported verbatim. All one need do is check out www.oireachtas.ie and enter any date between 1919 and 1921 and one will find extant every debate that democratic Chamber had. That Parliament was extraordinary because, despite the fact the British Government would not recognise the democratic wish, it set up its own consular services in Versailles. It had a massive diplomatic mission to America and it set up consular offices there. It set up its own justice system, courts and police. It had a culture department. There was a big debate in that Dáil, which was very interesting. Cathal Brugha proposed that the Army - the IRA - would come under the control of the Dáil. Extraordinarily, in view of future history, that proposal was seconded by Terence MacSwiney. In a time still to come, Cathal Brugha's son was to marry Terence MacSwiney's daughter in an extraordinary symmetry of history. This concept that has been so fundamental to this State, and which has been different in so many other newly independent states, of the Army coming under the control of the democratic Parliament, was laid in the 1920 period. It is only when we look at this total picture and the extraordinary movement that grew out of it that we can then understand why it is important that when we celebrate and commemorate 1916, we do it in a holistic fashion and realise the importance of the event. Sometimes we think things that happen here are important worldwide. Funnily enough, I believe in this case it is the other way around. Too many people see this as a local event rather than a catalytic event that tore down an empire. Therefore, I believe that in commemorating 1916 next year and in subsequent years, there will be huge interest, not only from our own diaspora, but from other nations that became free as a result of what happened in Dublin. This brings me to the nub of the Bill. This Bill seeks to ensure that the State takes to itself the power to preserve all of the relevant sites relative to 1916. The huge interest in the Easter Rising right across the country is amazing. People have great pride in their past. I have been contacted by people connected with the Fingal Brigade, for example, and by people and families connected with different battalions, with Boland's Mill, Jacob's and the South Dublin Union. They all believe that as part of the greater totality, but also in their local areas, they should be recognised as part of the Easter Rising. Our Bill seeks to set up a 1916 quarter, a company, a 1916 quarter renewal limited. This is based on the Temple Bar model but is slightly more dispersed because the Easter Rising took place in many parts of Dublin. The centre of the Easter Rising was the GPO and the area adjacent to it, particularly Moore Street where the last stand was made. It is important to note also that right around the city, there were other important sites, Jacob's, the College of Surgeons, Boland's Mill, Mount Street, the South Dublin Union, which is now St. James's Hospital, and so on. Some of those places have changed utterly since 1916 but some are unchanged, for example, the schoolhouse in Northumberland Road, which is now a hotel, was left intact. It is important we have a system whereby the State now, and into the future guarantees that these important buildings, the site of this important event, will not be destroyed. I would like to address the Moore Street issue. The issue is simple. The State has bought a number of the houses but the difficulty is that the full streetscape of that part of Dublin as it was in 1916 is not guaranteed to be left intact by what the Government is doing and that we will find these four houses in the middle of a modern shopping centre, making it difficult for visitors to visualise the Dublin of 1916. Furthermore, if we continue along this route and the Government does not step in, we could, considering the history of the area, have inappropriate development in Moore Street. The proposal for an Irish language cultural centre in that part of town, which is something we need in the city centre, would make a big contribution to posterity.  The advice normally given to governments in cases such as this is based on the issue of money. As a Minister, I always saw capital expenditure on a one-off basis as very different from current expenditure. If a government takes on expenditure of €10 million this year on something that will continue in the future, that amounts to €100 million after ten years. However, if a government takes on a one-off capital expenditure, once the money is spent, there is no further demand on the purse. There is a huge difference between necessary capital expenditure and current expenditure. If we look around, we will see where governments in the past took courageous stands and were willing to invest capital. At Newgrange, for example, quite a significant amount was spent but no doubt at the time people argued the moneys could be spent on hospitals or other issues. In the context of what we are talking about here, we are asking that in the centenary year, a decision is made to pass this Bill and for a decision to be made then to preserve these sites, starting with the Moore Street site. Appropriate development could then take place under this company that would not destroy the important streetscape. I believe that if we have the courage to make this decision, the Irish people will thank us for doing it as will future generations. It is important we do not allow short-term considerations stand in our way because in ten or 20 years' time, people will say the amount required was a modest enough sum for the benefit achieved by it. Today, a group outside Leinster House was selling bonds to try to raise money from the public to save the Moore Street centre. I commend them on their work. They have taken on a huge task and I was happy to support them and to buy one of the bonds. However, I believe this is really a matter for the Government. It is a matter that is bigger than any one group. The Government, on behalf of the Irish people, should take this step. I hope the Minister of State will support this Bill. I hope that in time this decision, if taken, will be seen by the Government to be the right decision. I hope it will be seen as an act of vandalism if we allow this important site to be destroyed. If we are brave enough to take this decision, many visitors from all around the world will visit this site in years to come.They will do so just as they now queue outside Kilmainham Gaol, which was saved by a voluntary committee in the 1960s. I was often there in the 1960s when they were doing it and it is now one of the treasured and iconic sites belonging to the State, where one must queue to get in. The GPO, its interpretive centre and Moore Street - with the traders on that street part of the scene - will become one of the "must visit" places on a tour of Dublin. People will come to spend hours there if we have the courage to act. I recommend the Bill to the House. I hope we will not divide on it because I do not want a division. Nobody wants that. In putting forward the Bill, Fianna Fáil is hoping we will endorse a decision that the Government can take to preserve these sites and ensure they remain for posterity, so the physical legacy of 1916 can be preserved. These are places where, for example, The O'Rahilly wrote his last letter to his wife and where the surrender note was written. I always think that one of the very great decisions of the Rising was the decision to call it off in order to save civilian lives. That becomes an even greater decision when one realises that those who signed the surrender note knew they were signing their own death warrants. They did not glory in slaughter and they wanted to preserve civilian lives. Therefore, the place where that incredibly brave decision was taken should never be destroyed and it should be preserved for posterity.

We are all aware of the importance of 1916 and its commemoration next year. Deputy Ó Cuív has been to the forefront in our party in ensuring that we are leading this commemoration by establishing the commemoration committee, or Coiste 1916, which is chaired by the Deputy. He has been doing tremendous work in ensuring that the celebrations next year will come to the fore and the descendants of the people involved in 1916 can have a place of honour and pride in the those commemorations. This Bill deals with the Moore Street area and I will come back to that in a few minutes. I wish to reflect on the connection between 1916 and my county and town of Enniscorthy, each year the local authority and community of which have been to the fore in celebrating on Easter Monday for probably 50 or 60 years. There is mass in the cathedral and people march to the market square in order to lay wreaths at the monument. It is important that such actions are recognised. The national celebrations next year will be significant but generations of people in Enniscorthy have kept the commemorations to the fore, recognising the important role played by Enniscorthy as one of the few towns outside Dublin that supported Pearse and his comrades in the 1916 Rising. In March 1916, Pádraig Pearse visited Enniscorthy for the commemoration of Robert Emmet, the republican leader hanged for his rising of 1803. In public, in the Athenaeum Theatre, Pearse delivered what Paul Galligan remembered as an "impressive" lecture on Emmet. The Enniscorthy battalion provided a guard of honour. Such rallies, like the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in Dublin in 1915, allowed the Volunteers to openly flout the authority of the British state. John O'Reilly from Enniscorthy remembered, "We had the buildings under armed guard that night and were prepared to resist any interference from the RIC or other authorities." In private, Pearse told Volunteer officers such as Séamus Doyle that the orders for an armed uprising would come soon. In Enniscorthy, the Athenaeum was made the republican headquarters, over which flew the green, white and orange tricolour flag. We have heard much about the tricolour first being flown in Waterford but people from Enniscorthy and Wexford in general would contend that they flew the tricolour flag at the same time as Waterford. History has since shown that this may have been the case. As I mentioned, Enniscorthy has been to the forefront in celebrating every Easter Monday. In 1994 or 1995, it was not popular to invite a person from Sinn Féin to events but the then chairman of Enniscorthy Urban Council invited Mr. Martin McGuinness to the celebrations. It was not very popular, as I stated, and some people resigned, while ex-Army personnel left the function when Mr. McGuinness arrived. We in Enniscorthy maintain that we sowed the first seeds of what was to become the Good Friday Agreement by accepting Mr. McGuinness into the fold on that occasion. We had Comóradh Éirí Amach na Cásca for years, with descendants of those who took part in the 1916 Rising being involved through the years in keeping the celebration going. We now have the 1916 committee, which will prepare the celebrations for Enniscorthy and Wexford in general next year. Books have been written recently by Professor Henry Goff, who wrote a history of 1916, and Mr. Bernard Browne, son of a former Fine Gael councillor, the late John Browne. The book is on the poetry and literature of 1916 from Wexford. It is important to recognise that the celebrations must go on outside Dublin as well. Some recognition has been given to towns like Enniscorthy, Ashbourne and Galway. Last Sunday, we saw the commemoration to Liam Mellows in Castletown, Wexford, another Volunteer of that era. Many relatives of leaders of 1916 are to the fore now in the preparations in my hometown. They are seeking to represent families at the celebrations in Dublin. Some have received invitations but others have not. It is important to invite as many people from rural Ireland as possible whose relatives were involved with 1916 to the celebrations in Dublin. It is not just a Dublin event and the role of the families and descendants should be recognised. Enniscorthy will participate in the laying of wreaths at the same time as Dublin, Ashbourne and Deputy Ó Cuív's county of Galway. It is important that wreaths should be laid simultaneously across the four areas. That would recognise the importance of rurally based 1916 commemorations. Tonight's debate is about Moore Street and the historic buildings there, including No. 16 Moore Street, the last headquarters of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic during the 1916 Easter Rising. Volunteers broke into the houses on Moore Street, tunnelled their way through the terrace and took up new positions in each house, making No. 16 the headquarters.As many as 300 Irish Volunteers and members of Cumann na mBan escaped to the building from the GPO after it caught fire following bombardment by British artillery during Easter week 1916. The buildings were designated a national monument in 2007 by the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Dick Roche. Given that they are a national monument, the current Minister has a duty to ensure the buildings do not descend into permanent decay. It is very easy for the latter to happen to buildings. The Athenaeum, which was the headquarters in Enniscorthy at the time, fell into serious decay over the years. Following representation from all of us, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform allocated €1.3 million a few months ago for the renovation of the Athenaeum. These renovations are under way and it will be one of the key buildings next year. One of the major events will be its opening next Easter. We accept and recognise the contribution of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in making such a large sum of money available for the renovation of the Athenaeum. It is an iconic building that is steeped in history. It had fallen into decay but is now being restored to its former glory, which is very welcome. The forthcoming centenary of the 1916 Rising marks an important milestone in the history of the Republic. The Easter Rising defined us as a country. It does not belong to any one party but rather to the people of Ireland. I accept that some historians in recent years may have tried to rewrite the history of 1916 but it is important that we accept 1916 warts and all and accept that those involved made a valiant effort to secure freedom for our people after many years of British rule. As Deputy Ó Cuív noted, the 150 descendants of nearly 300 participants in the Rising must be central to any State celebrations. This is why I said earlier that the descendants of participants in Enniscorthy should be given recognition at both local and national level. The Government has been criticised for operating in a haphazard way and possibly taking a disinterested approach but we appreciate the allocation of money by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. He made sure of this following representations from Oireachtas Members, the 1916 committee, the county manager in Wexford and many more people who argued for recognition of the role played by Enniscorthy in the celebrations and in the renovation of the Athenaeum. In many ways, the Easter Rising in County Wexford was a follow-on from the 1798 rebellion. Wexford is famous for that era when Wexford people, led by Fr. John Murphy, fought at Vinegar Hill, Tubberneering and other areas of the county. If one traces back the people involved in the 1916 Rising, one will find that many of them were descendants of families that were involved in the 1798 rebellion. They were still involved. We have a continuation of these families who are very much at the heart of the celebrations of 1916. The people of Wexford and Enniscorthy take great pride in celebrating 1916. Every Easter Monday, we celebrate and recognise the magnificent role played by the people there at that time. Enniscorthy is a small town but one that played a significant role in both 1798 and 1916 in the fight for Irish freedom. The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is here tonight. I know that Waterford played a part as well. I hope we will recognise the importance of Moore Street and that the Government will consider taking on board the Bill put forward by Deputy Ó Cuív. A great deal of time and effort has gone into preparing it. The Bill is not about Deputy Ó Cuív, it is about recognising the importance of Moore Street. I have not been in Moore Street very often. I visited the markets a couple of times but the people out there recognise the significance of the Moore Street buildings from Nos. 14 to 17 and the need to renovate and restore them and give them the status they deserve. We fully support the site becoming a museum devoted to the events of 1916. It is very important that we would have a museum to that effect. Enniscorthy Castle, which is a museum, contains a lot of artefacts and family mementoes of 1916 and further back. I can say categorically that people visit the castle on a regular basis and have a great sense of pride in the role played by the people in 1916. Our Bill now goes further and seeks to redevelop the entire Moore Street area and its environs. Our councillors have campaigned with other councillors for the restoration of Moore Street and for the buildings to be taken into State ownership by Dublin City Council. Senator Darragh O'Brien introduced the Bill in the Seanad and Deputy Ó Cuív amended and introduced it in the Dáil. The debate this evening and tomorrow night is very significant at this time. We are five months away from celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising - a milestone in our history and a milestone in setting this country on the road to freedom, including economic freedom which is as important as any other type. We have ploughed a long furrow over the past 100 years. Last Sunday in Castletown, Seán Haughey asked what the leaders of 1916 would think of us today. How would they react to some of the things that are happening in this country? It is a different era and time but we must recognise that the men and women of 1916 led the way forward for the freedom of this country, including its economic freedom. It is for us as a people who are now custodians of democracy in this country to make sure it is protected and enhanced and that we look back every so often. Next Easter will give us an opportunity to look back and realise the sacrifices made by the people at that time. By looking back and taking inspiration from their leadership, we can move forward as a country to make it one in which all of our people can live in freedom, equality and fraternity.

At the outset and while Deputy Browne is here, I must state that, as a Waterford man, I cannot concede that the Irish tricolour was first flown in Wexford. I think it is well known that Thomas Francis Meagher, the great American, Irish and Waterford patriot, unveiled the flag at 33 The Mall in Waterford on 7 March 1848. That event is celebrated annually by the Thomas Francis Meagher committee, which has a very public event that celebrates that very important event in our history. I had the honour of addressing the celebration earlier this year. I do, however, agree with Deputy Browne and all Deputies that it is essential that all of our people have the opportunity to remember and celebrate the events of 1916. It is a shared history and heritage that must never be forgotten and it is important that all communities in all counties have an opportunity to remember in whatever way they see fit with the support of the State those who went before us and fought and played their part in Irish freedom. The primary aim of the Bill is to establish two new limited companies to be known as 1916 quarter renewal limited and 1916 quarter properties limited, both financed by the State to approve respectively the use of existing or proposed buildings and premises in the Moore Street area and to act as a development company to oversee the development of the area for approved 1916-related activities and uses, including commercial developments. The Bill further proposes that the development company would have functions for the compulsory acquisition of land in the Moore Street area and the Minister for Finance would have a power to guarantee borrowings by 1916 quarter properties limited. However, while appreciating the constructive motivations behind the Bill, and genuinely wanting to acknowledge this and that the Moore Street area is of significant historical importance in the gaining of Irish independence and the formation of the State, I cannot accept it. The role of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is primarily concerned with the protection and conservation of the national monument comprising Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. That Minister has no role in planning and development in the wider Moore Street area, which is under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with the relevant local planning authority or other designated development authority. Indeed, there could be a conflict of roles where on the one hand, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is charged with safeguarding our built heritage, notably the national monument comprising Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, and on the other hand, would be supporting development that could also potentially adversely impact the national monument and other historic buildings or fabric in the Moore Street area. Following a Government decision of 31 March 2015, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street were acquired by the State during the summer after other initiatives to save the buildings had not proved successful. The Government's decision to purchase and preserve these buildings recognises their historical importance for our nation and will ensure that the long-term future of this landmark will be protected and safeguarded. Bringing them into public ownership also allows for the development of a 1916 commemorative centre on the site. The Government has since awarded a contract for a comprehensive scheme of conservation works on the national monument buildings. The works have already commenced and will be completed during the 2016 centenary year. The restoration will reveal the period architectural detail, the living conditions and above all, the imprint of the insurgency. The primary focus of the work is to show the buildings as they were during the 1916 Rising, allowing them to illuminate that critical and important chapter in our history. The new commemorative centre will act as a lasting tribute to the 1916 leaders, allowing people to step back in time to the dramatic final moments of the Rising. Coupled with the new visitor centre being developed in the GPO, which will be just a few minutes' walk away, the Moore Street commemorative centre will be a fitting and permanent tribute to the Easter Rising and its leaders who played a very important role in gaining our national independence and indeed influenced and inspired other countries along a similar path.  I note that the proposed Bill is aimed at controlling development of the area surrounding the national monument site, which lands are in private ownership and which are the subject of legitimate planning permission for specific development works. It would be inappropriate for me or any other authority to interfere in that process. When it comes to urban development and regeneration, I, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have primacy and the Department is already active with various initiatives that beneficially affect the Moore Street area. The proposed Bill would only serve to complicate rather than streamline the various measures in place. For example, in 2012, the Government published "Putting People First - An Action Programme for Effective Local Government". At its core, this programme proposes the local government system be the primary vehicle for overall economic and community development at local level, including the regeneration aspects of that brief. That action programme more widely sets out an overall vision for local government to be the principal vehicle of governance and public service at local level leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. Consistent with this overall vision, Government policy is to build on the local government process and not to establish separate or parallel public bodies or organisations distinct from the local government system unless, in exceptional circumstances, the need for this is clearly demonstrated. Moreover, the model for the establishment of the proposed special development vehicles is based on previous such vehicles for example, Temple Bar Properties and Dublin Docklands Authority, which are currently being disbanded. The establishment of further State bodies of this nature is contrary to the Government's policy to create efficiencies in the delivery of public services and savings in expenditure. Regeneration initiatives of this nature have now moved on to a new phase that build on enhanced local authority capability in this area rather than setting up new bodies to undertake similar actions. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, Dublin City Council, as both local government and planning consent authority, is the most appropriate entity to manage the continuing development of this important inner city area of Dublin. Already, sections of Moore Street and the auxiliary lanes are within the O'Connell Street architectural conservation area, designated in July 2001, and the O'Connell Street area of special planning control adopted by Dublin City Council in September 2009. The main objectives of the Bill are unclear in terms of compliance with the current Dublin City development plan process and objectives for the inner city area of Dublin City. A development approach such as that proposed in the Bill could be impractical given the variety of private, commercial and publicly-owned properties within its remit, and the process involved in setting up the supporting statutory provisions could be difficult. Furthermore, the size of the area in question and its variety of property types does not on a practical level, lend itself to the type of development model envisaged. Indeed, management of a national monument is best developed, managed and promoted as a specific proposal in tandem with Dublin City Council and other key stakeholders. These mechanisms operate within the wider policy framework of the Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017, which is under review and was recently put out to public consultation. It remains open to the city council to prepare a statutory local area plan for the area under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2010. Dublin City Council would be the relevant authority to oversee implementation of such a plan. Therefore, an extensive array of planning policies and actions has been put in place for which the city council is the relevant statutory implementation body. Taking into account that the local government, planning policy and development consent, and conservation policy and implementation issues pertaining to this area have already been broadly settled, it is unclear what additional clarity or impetus over and above the role of Dublin City Council, could be brought to the need for the regeneration of this area. I have full confidence in the city council's ability to manage the area using the policy already settled and the measures already in place. Government policy and my policy as Minister of State for the Environment, Community and Local Government is to build on the local government process and not to establish separate or parallel public bodies or organisations distinct from the local government system. There is, however, a much wider dimension to this and there was a context for it during the previous administration's tenure. That Government commissioned the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programme, more commonly known as an bord snip nua, to examine, among other things, the rationalisation of State agencies with a view to saving money in the delivery of services. Those same principles apply today.  On a technical note, section 13 of the Bill proposes that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would act as guarantor on moneys owed by the new development company. Under Article 17.2 of the Constitution the inclusion of such a financial clause in the Bill, without the support of the Government, would be unconstitutional and therefore cannot be enacted. I am also at a loss as to why the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is given the primary role in this Bill as her role has nothing to do with planning and development. I suspect that it is in some way to do with the Minister's role in the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street which has been acquired for the State by her Department. No. 16 Moore Street is where the decision to surrender was made by the leaders of the 1916 Rising. Nos. 14-17 Moore Street were declared a national monument in 2007 as the most authentic and complete examples of surviving pre-1916 Moore Street buildings associated with the Rising. The monument buildings have been privately owned as part of a property portfolio for the proposed Dublin central development site extending over Moore Street, Henry Street and O'Connell Street. Following on from the Government decision of 31 March this year, approving the acquisition and safeguarding of the national monument, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht arranged for purchasing of the property to allow it to be refurbished and presented as a commemorative centre to be accessible in time for Easter 2016. A great deal of effort has been made by the Minister and her predecessor to ensure that plans for the national monument secure the retention of the buildings and their historic fabric. In particular, considerable time and effort has been put into finalising the detail of a formal consent by the Minister under the National Monuments Acts, which retain all pre-1916 elements and authorise only appropriate and sympathetic interventions to comply with fire and health and safety regulations. Earlier proposals to secure the restoration of the national monument through a combination of funding from NAMA and a property exchange between Dublin City Council and the developer within the Dublin central development site did not materialise owing to opposition from a number of elected city councillors who at that time had been supporting a battlefield quarter for the area. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht subsequently intervened with her own proposals to acquire the national monument, secure it for the Irish nation and its people and restore it to use as a fitting commemorative centre on the site. This Bill recreates a model, as acknowledged by its proposer in the Seanad debate, along the lines of Temple Bar Properties Limited, which is currently being disbanded and transited to Dublin City Council's control. I have referred to the problematic nature of that model and how policy has moved on. There appears to be limited accountability in the model contained in this Bill. For example, there is provision for the appointment of the directors of the renewal company by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but there is a question as to why that Minister is involved in this regard when the broad Moore Street area is not designated as a national monument. There is no provision for the removal of the directors, for their tenure or for any type of democratic accountability by the company, which would be important. On the other hand, we have a model with Dublin City Council and I have spoken of the initiatives that are being taken for the general area. The council has a development plan review process under way that will encompass the area. There are also other important related initiatives alongside the initiative on the Moore Street buildings, including those relating to the GPO visitors' centre, Parnell Square and the tenement museum on Henrietta Street. As I have already indicated, I have confidence in the city council as the appropriate, democratically elected body through which proposals to create a proper and fitting commemorative centre in Moore Street are progressed. Fianna Fáil is proposing in this Bill that the Government should set up a development company for the Moore Street area. However, we know from recent experience that such models do not work and have encountered difficulties. In addition, it has not been shown or proven how much these proposals would cost the Exchequer and taxpayer. In line with Better Local Government, the Government's policy is to devolve more responsibility to local authorities in respect of their respective areas and not take power from them. The future of the national monument buildings referred to on Moore Street has been secured and they will be accessible in order that citizens and visitors can learn the history of the 1916 Rising. The debate on this matter in the Seanad last June focused on the commemoration of the 1916 Rising. This is an ideal opportunity in the history of our Republic as we face the centenary of 1916 to reassess what we are about as a country. There are many people in our society who actively support this commemoration, particularly those on the edge of society. The commemoration will lead to a new evaluation of the values that underpin our Republic. Many of the commemorative events planned are focused on what we want for the next 100 years. We must have a proper investigation of what happened 100 years ago in order that people can appreciate the real sacrifices that were made. Furthermore, we must never shy away from the reality that 1916 was the birth of the Republic in which we now live. It is also important that we constantly reimagine and reaffirm those values written into the Proclamation, including equal rights and opportunities for all our citizens and cherishing all the children of the nation equally. We need to appreciate what happened in the week of the Rising but we must also ask why we are commemorating this important event. We are basically doing it to ensure we can have a proper appreciation of the values that must underpin the modern Republic in which we all live. While I appreciate the good intentions behind this Bill and the contribution of all Members this evening, I am of the opinion that the current approach taken by the Government in acquiring the national monument on Moore Street and in commissioning conservation works thereon is the correct one and should be commended. I am confident that this will protect the buildings for the Irish nation and its citizens. The buildings and the proposed interpretative centre on that site will be a fitting commemoration of the 1916 Rising and its leaders as well as complementing the new visitor centre being developed in the GPO.  If we take a snapshot of that entire geographical area and consider the work ongoing on the interpretative centre at the GPO, the proposal for an interpretative centre in Moore Street, the tenement museum in Henrietta Street, the proposed development of the Abbey Theatre and the Parnell Square central library, that entire centre and the connectivity between those sites will lift the north inner city area. The north inner city area is worthy and deserving of that. These projects will significantly enhance the appeal of the area and will bring thousands of new visitors each year with obvious spin-offs for local businesses. This, in turn, will spur on other new developments in the area. They will complement the many other urban regeneration measures being taken by this Government to breathe new life into the community and economy of this significant central part of our capital city.

He was reading a script that was ably prepared for him by the Civil Service. The first thing we need to get out of the way is how we define the national monument, which is what is at issue here. The approach commended by the Minister of State is a limited view of a number of houses on the terrace and that is it. He seems to be quite happy to preserve this small amount of the terrace and allow it to live in splendid isolation in a sea of what would - going by the previous proposals - be grotesque commercial developments. The Minister of State seems to be missing the entire point. Do the Minister of State and Deputy Ó Cuív remember when the Taoiseach spoke about the laneways of history? He visited the site and was clearly moved by the history and the residences there. He called them "the laneways of history".

The essential point is that however we go about it, we should define the national monument beyond an isolated number of houses in the terrace to encompass the whole area, including the laneways of history. We should truly preserve what is a very historic site. The Minister of State remarked that the Moore Street area is not designated as a national monument. He seemed to be accusing Deputy Ó Cuív of misconstruing or misunderstanding what the national monument is but he understands that precisely, as all of us do.We are urging that the national monument be more broadly cast and more inclusive. If the Minister of State believed what he said about commemorating the Rising but, more importantly, about underpinning and reaffirming those values as the ones on which we will build a republic - we do not yet live in one, by the way - he would understand the concept of monument much more broadly than the very narrow and mean definition with which he is running. The Minister of State seems to misunderstand that part of Dublin which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I happen to represent; it is included in our Dáil constituency. He has no appreciation of the sensitivity the area deserves. It is clearly lost on him that there has been massive uncertainty and speculation about all of these issues, which is a matter of public concern. It is not a hobbyhorse for a limited number of parliamentarians or a narrow section of society. One really would have thought that we had learned a few hard lessons from the destruction of our Viking heritage at Wood Quay or the demolition of the outstanding Georgian facades on St. Stephen's Green which were wanton acts of destruction. It was vandalism, pure and simple. We know that now, but at the time when these things were done, people stood up and defended them in the same monotone going-through-the-motions way the Minister of State has adopted and explained the value of modernity and modernisation and so on. We should have learned the lesson that we should protect that which is precious. We should have learned the lesson that if, on the one hand, we are to extol the virtues of the Rising and the women and men who led and fought at the time, we should actually respect the heritage, including the built heritage and geography of where these historic events took place. It beggars belief that a proposal for a 1916 quarter and a revolutionary quarter would be mired in controversy. The arguments over the preservation of this battlefield site date back beyond the term of the Government. Previous Governments were equally guilty of allowing uncertainty to fester and this area of national and international significance to fall into disrepair, ruin and decay. It is dereliction de facto. Sinn Féin has been consistent throughout this process in arguing strongly that we should protect this revolutionary site. We have repeatedly raised the issue and our concerns about the preservation of the battlefield site at Dublin City Council and Oireachtas level. Serious questions remain unanswered, particularly about the dealings management at Dublin City Council has had with the developers originally involved in what was to be the development of the site. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of these controversies. The existing site and plans could only be said to have been pulled together by dubious means. The process has been scandal ridden from the very start. The original proposal was for a huge shopping centre. Imagine it as a legacy to the women and men of 1916, as an edifice to honour the Republic. It was, of course, made all the more distasteful against the background of dubious dealings I have mentioned. The proposal for a giant shopping centre was originally put forward by the developer Joe O’Reilly’s company, Chartered Land. Later, a block of properties owned by his company became part of NAMA’s loan portfolio, appropriately enough called Project Jewel. The properties included sites between O’Connell Street and Moore Street and the area involved covered much of the 1916 battlefield site. Excluded from the portfolio is a small terrace section on Moore Street, the site of the last headquarters of the 1916 leaders. This portfolio of properties has now been sold to the English-based company, Hammerson, in partnership with Allianz. We, in Sinn Féin, have written to Hammerson requesting a meeting. We have made it aware of our concerns about the use it may make of some of the properties it has acquired and which are of significant national importance. Although not open to a meeting, it has acknowledged the historical significance of the sites it has acquired in Project Jewel that include areas around Moore Street. While the future of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street has been safeguarded by the Government, all else remains at risk. It is hard for me to grasp that the Minister of State would commend this approach as though it were some great achievement. It is minimalism taken to the nth degree. I go so far as to say it shows marked disrespect for Dublin's north inner city, the Rising, its leaders and the values of the Republic. Let us consider some of what is in jeopardy. The location of the first council of war by the rebels as they fled the GPO was No. 10 Moore Street. What about Nos. 20 and 21 Moore Street? They also hold great historical significance because at this location the surrender order was accepted after consultation with Tom Clarke, Seán Mac Diarmada, Joseph Plunkett and Michael Collins. Why would the Government jeopardise this? As we draw towards the conclusion of 2015 and look to the centenary, how on earth could any Minister with an ounce of cop-on or half an ounce of self-respect stand in this Chamber and say this is an acceptable way to proceed? It is not. The Minister of State still has an opportunity to do the right thing and preserve our history before it is lost to developers. The Minister of State mentioned economic development. I have a natural interest in the economic development and vibrancy of the north inner city of Dublin, as do all Dubliners and people across the country. I ask the Minister of State to imagine the battlefield preserved and being developed appropriately as a magnet in the heart of rebel Dublin for visitors and Irish people. That would be the right thing to do. I urge the Government to take that course of action with all haste.

Unemployment was rampant. There was a massive rate of child mortality and swelling slums were rife. The only option many people had was to be shipped off to the killing fields of Europe to spill their blood for their imperialist oppressor. Out of this despair and destitution, arrived the men and women of 1916 who offered Irish people an alternative vision. They offered a republic that would guarantee equal rights and equal opportunities for all its citizens and declared its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally. The hope and vision they offered to Ireland, to strike for her freedom, are as true today as they were 100 years ago. Ireland today is searching for hope in turbulent economic times. Similar to the conditions in which the men and women of 1916 found themselves, we are at the whim of foreign rulers and foreign markets. There is no finer example of courage and determination than the one the men and women of 1916 set.For the past 100 years we have drawn inspiration from their heroism and as we are now in these difficult times we should still draw inspiration from them into the future, yet, a Government in this country would even consider not securing the Moore Street battlefield site. The buildings are not just bricks and mortar; the area is a symbol of why we exist as a country and as a people. The environs of Moore Street make up a very important part of our story as a nation because from that block with its small rooms and lanes emerged this Parliament. Every person who stands and speaks in this Chamber owes allegiance to those who occupied the environs of Moore Street. Future generations will condemn any politician or Government that would allow the vandalisation of this precious monument. Seán Mac Diarmada came from north Leitrim. His cottage is preserved as it was when he was alive. The vandalisation that will be visited on the Moore Street area is as bad as what Seán Mac Diarmada would see if he were alive today and looking out his window. He would see the beautiful rolling hills and drumlins but in 20 years' time he would perhaps see fracking wells. Imagine that. How would he feel if we were to vandalise that beautiful area for the benefit of the very few? If the men and women of 1916, who showed such courage and leadership, came back, what would they say about the vandalisation of that area of Moore Street? We must stop the penny-pinching. One can get shopping malls a hundred a dime in any country in the world but there is one and only one battlefield site in the centre of Dublin. It should be there for the next century and the next thousand years. We should do the right thing by it.

Every step and few yards on that route tells a story of the various men and women involved – the Volunteers, the Citizen Army, the IRB and Cumann na mBan – who fought and defended so many places on that route until they dug their way through No. 10 Moore Street into Nos. 14 to 17. While Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street have been designated as a national monument it is the opinion of many historians, relatives, supporters and many others that the whole area is a battlefield site of immense historical and cultural significance and it deserves so much more than it is being given. While Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street will be preserved as a national monument, that will be accompanied by the total obliteration of the laneways of history. I do not understand this disregard for places of historical significance in that all we want to do is knock them down. We lost so much of Viking Dublin, Tara, the Mendicity Institution and we very nearly lost Kilmainham Gaol. Are we now going to lose another area of great historical significance and for what – another shopping mall, another shopping centre in an area surrounded by shops and shopping centres when we see shops such as Clerys and Boyers being closed? When I asked for the independent comprehensive assessment on the site the Minister refused, saying an assessment had been carried out. Who was it done by? It was the same developer who wants to knock down the whole area and would have knocked down Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street if he had the opportunity. It is the same developer who allowed the whole site, including Nos. 14 to 17, fall into dereliction and disrepair. The Minister also said in her reply that there had been detailed consideration and appraisal of all the relevant factors. I find that incredible because all the relevant factors have not been taken into consideration. If they were, we would be treating the whole area with much more respect in acknowledgement of all that had gone on, not just in Nos. 14 to 17 but on the surrounding streets and laneways. The Myles battlefield report identified the whole area as a monument and acknowledged what happened on that journey, where so many people were killed. We have O’Brien’s Mineral Water building in Henry Place, which was occupied by the Volunteers. The White House was occupied and held by Michael Collins. No. 10 was where the first council of war was held and there was an overnight stay. The Bottling Store was occupied. Hanlon's – Nos. 20 to 21 – was where the surrender order was accepted by the Volunteers. O’Rahilly Parade is that most moving place where a letter was written from The O’Rahilly to his wife. How could we possibly say that a comprehensive assessment was carried out when all of that is being ignored? That area is the link between the GPO, Kilmainham Gaol and Richmond Barracks. There is a need now for a more innovative, dignified, respectful vision for the area. There is potential for a historical cultural quarter with appropriate small businesses or arts centres in the area, and above all of that, housing because there was a time when people lived in Moore Street. That type of development very much complements the historic street trading tradition because a massive shopping centre with discount supermarkets is going to bring an end to the traders and the stall holders who are already struggling. The Taoiseach’s response to me on Leaders’ Questions was that the decade of centenary commemorative events must be inclusive, sensitive and appropriate. It is not sensitive and it is not appropriate to surround Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street in this most inappropriate way, by being dwarfed by a shopping centre. Permission has been granted for a hotel on Moore Lane, which means we are going to lose O’Rahilly Parade for what will be a service entrance to the hotel. Where is the appropriateness and the sensitivity in that? I have been asking questions repeatedly of the Minister and I am not getting answers. Who valued Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street at €4 million? Why was it valued at that amount? Surely €4 million would have bought the whole terrace? Were the buildings purchased by a CPO under a State order? If so, why could the whole area not have been purchased in that way? Who has costed the restoration at €5 million? A contractor has been named for Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. I have made inquiries but I have still not received an answer about when the project went out to tender, how many tenders were received and who, why and how the particular contractor was chosen. The irony of ironies is that it is the ministerial consent order of the Chartered Land team that had in its plan the destruction of the entire area is being adopted. Dr. Pat Wallace said that any consent should be mindful of the national historical importance of the whole Moore Street area. Seamus Lyham said the national monument exists within a historic battlefield. When the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government she said there are specific guidelines in regard to developments that affect a protected structure or an architectural conservation area. The Imperial War Museum said the area is the only city-based 20th century battlefield site in all of Europe to survive and that is under threat now. Dr. Wallace said that once one allows the destruction of buildings and their neighbourhood ambience, one cannot bring them back. We cannot bring them back if we allow them to be destroyed. It is okay if the Government does not wish to accept the Fianna Fáil Bill but could it come up with something that would respect the entire area for its historical significance because that would be fitting, dignified and respectful?
