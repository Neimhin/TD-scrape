I note yesterday the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recommended an adjustment of €4 billion in the budget.  Following the general election and with full knowledge of the challenges ahead for the country, the Taoiseach pledged not to increase income tax rates or bands and the Tánaiste promised there would be no cuts to social welfare.  After 100 days in office these promises were reiterated.  Shortly afterwards the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he would not rule out tax increases or social welfare reductions.  It is now 119 days since that promise.  Will the Government take on board the recommendations of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council or reject its advice?When the Taoiseach came into government he said he would enter a new covenant with the people to tell them the truth no matter how painful and difficult it might be.

I ask the Minister to tell us for once and for all if the Government will honour the commitment, which was given not once but twice, that there will be no increases in income tax and no reduction in social welfare rates.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will not be announcing the budget today.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance on a date to be determined.  As the Taoiseach indicated yesterday, the full layout of the Estimates, reform agenda and budget will be determined by the Cabinet on Tuesday.  The Taoiseach will give the House the full information on the process and sequencing of announcements after the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.As the Deputy knows, the Government established the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to give independent advice and that is what it has done.  Its advice will be listened to, together with all the other factors the Government has to take into account, in determining the scale of adjustment required.  The commitment both parties in government have repeatedly given is that we will reduce the deficit to 8.6% of GDP next year.  The exact quantum of the adjustment to reach that target is currently being determined.  We needed to have a firm determination of the growth rates and the final accounts, in terms of taxation and revenue to the State, before we make a final determination on that.The Deputy mentioned adjustments in social welfare.  He had responsibility in that area when the national recovery plan was signed off on.  The former Government left us with a legacy because in the programme it signed off on it left a hole to be filled by social welfare reductions of €1.91 billion.

I ask for a simple Yes or No answer.  Will he honour the commitments he gave on income tax and social welfare?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The former Minister's Government left us with €2 billion in cuts on the table.  That was its legacy.  We are doing our best to determine a fair Estimates process, have a comprehensive review of every line of expenditure and examine where waste can be eliminated and where we can amalgamate and change things.  All of this will be laid out over a period of time between now and December.  Uniquely, there will be a full opportunity for the committees of the House and the House itself, if necessary, to debate this.  It will be a different type of Estimates process and will be laid out before the House next week.

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has already accepted at least one piece of its independent advice, namely that the extent of the cuts should be ratcheted up to €4 billion in the forthcoming budget.  As the Minister weighs up this matter, do the social costs of this type of brutal austerity feature in his thinking on the comprehensive spending review?  The Minister's colleagues on the Government benches skulked in here last night and refused to support the community and voluntary sector.

If he examined what has happened just up the road, he would discover that despite a cut to the block grant, the Executive has worked to ring-fence services and to create new income streams for the most socially disadvantaged.The Minister says he will not pretend.  The great pretence is that everyone is taking the pain together and that the Government will defend the rights of citizens.  The greatest pretence is that this Government represents different policies from those pursued by the previous Fianna Fáil Administration.  That is the reality.

The truth is that finding that sort of money is not easy.  Deputy McDonald's Sinn Féin colleagues in Northern Ireland know that finding €4 billion will result in decisions that the party finds unpalatable.  The leader of the SDLP has described the decisions made so far by Sinn Féin as punishing low-paid workers, teachers, students, schoolchildren, the construction industry and all those dependent on the health services, has accused the party of crudely dismissing the advice of all independent commentators and has described Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland——

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Next Sunday, at 3 p.m., thousands of people will meet at the wooden bridge in Clontarf to protest about the proposed construction of an eight foot high barrier on the seafront.  This protest is being organised by Councillor Damian O'Farrell and a number of local residents.  I raise this because Dublin Bay is important to the environment, tourism and economy of the city.  Is the Minister aware that many people have fought hard for several years to protect and preserve Dublin Bay, particularly the 52 acres, as it is a huge amenity for Clontarf on the north side of Dublin and for the people of Dublin city and county?  Thousands of people walk, cycle and jog around this beautiful amenity.  Now there is a proposal to ruin it.I ask the Minister to intervene on this matter.  Is he aware of the proposal to build a structure up to eight feet high along the promenade?  Does he agree that this could destroy a beautiful scenic amenity and will he ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan to support the residents of Clontarf?  Will the Minister urge Dublin City Council, the Minister, Deputy Hogan and the Office of Public Works to consult with local residents and come up with a common-sense plan that prevents flooding but does not destroy a beautiful scenic amenity?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I share the Deputy's regard for the amenity of Dublin Bay.  It is one of the great amenities of the capital city and should  be available to citizens into the future.I understand that Dublin City Council is engaging with all the local residents regarding the concerns they have raised, particularly about the height of the proposed flood defences.  A balance must be struck.  Areas that are prone to flooding must be protected, particularly if global warming is to mean a greater threat of flooding.  That balance must be struck.  In Enniscorthy, in my own constituency, there is great debate about flood defences which impact on amenity.  We need to get that balance right.  I understand that the consultations are ongoing.  I understand that the Office of Public Works is also involved in reviewing the proposed flood defence scheme to ensure that the proper balance is struck.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I thank the Minister for his response.  Most Deputies will agree that balance is key in finding a resolution that satisfies all sides of this issue.The recent conference in Dublin Castle looked at tourism and ways of getting people to visit Ireland.  Is the Minister aware that the flood defence plan would have a significant economic, social and environmental impact on the Clontarf area and on the thousands of people who use it?  In 2014, for example, we will have celebrations to commemorate the battle of Clontarf.Does the Minister accept that the Aarhus convention was created to give citizens the right to a say in decision making that affects the environment?  Is this proposed plan in breach of that convention?  I ask the Minister to check that out.  I also ask the Minister to urge all those involved in this proposal to go back to the drawing board and come up with a sensible plan which deals with the issue so that the protection of the environment remains foremost, people are protected from floods and this wonderful amenity in Clontarf can be saved
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I am glad to hear of the plans to commemorate the battle of Clontarf.  We need to have as many tourism initiatives as we can.  This was central to the discussions on tourism promotion at the recent economic forum.Balance is the essence of the issue the Deputy raised.  If this issue had arisen last February or March, when there was extensive flooding in Dublin city, we might have had a different type of debate.  We need to ensure that proper flood protections are put in place with the least environmental impact on the residents involved.I will pass on the Deputy's deep concerns to the Minister of State in my own Department who is in charge of the OPW and to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	94	It is proposed to take No. 19, statements on releasing the value of State assets to help stimulate economic growth; and No. 19a, statements on Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.

There are eight sitting weeks to Christmas.  Can the Minister tell the House when the water services (amendment) Bill be published?  Is it the Government's intention that it will pass through both Houses before Christmas?  Second, the Construction Contracts Bill [Seanad] 2010 was passed in the Seanad during the term of the previous Government.  I understand the regulatory impact analysis of the Bill has been completed.  It is urgent that the Bill be passed as bona fide people are going out of business because they cannot get paid for work they have done.  Can the Minister confirm that the Bill, with amendments, will be completed by the Christmas recess?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The water services Bill will be introduced in this session. How it progresses is a matter for the Houses, so I cannot say when it will be concluded.  It will be done as expeditiously as possible.  I am particularly interested in the Construction Contracts Bill.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to take personal seizure of it, and he has done that.  He has had wide consultations on the Bill with, among others, Senator Feargal Quinn who is the original author of the Bill.  I understand a revised Bill will be introduced in this session.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Legal Services Bill was published yesterday.  It is not on the draft schedule for next week.  Can the Minister tell the House when it will come before the Dáil?  Can he also say something about the relationship between this Bill and judicial appointments?  It is depressing to see that the old boys' network is still alive and well, with people with political affiliations being appointed to the Bench.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The Legal Services Bill has been published.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I understand the reluctance of many people to contemplate the sale of any of our State assets.  My party is among them.Our commercial State companies have served this country well down through the years.  Many of them have been, and will continue to be, a core part of our economy involved in delivering strategic infrastructure and key services across a number of different sectors over many years.  They have innovated and developed significant expertise and technical knowledge and skills and have generated significant employment throughout the country.  It is for that reason the Government remains committed to ongoing State involvement in critical areas of our economic development.  However, we now find ourselves facing unprecedented challenges.  As Deputies will be aware, we are currently dependent on the financial assistance provided under the EU-IMF funding programme for the continued day-to-day operation of this State.  This year, the gap between Exchequer revenues and spending will be approximately €15 billion, even after the costs associated with repairing the banking system have been excluded.  This is simply not sustainable.  The overwhelming public need now, therefore, must be to bring sustainability to the public finances and to foster economic growth.  In these circumstances, it would be negligent of Government not to carefully examine all reasonable means to raise revenue and to reduce expenditure, including the release of some of the value across a wide range of our State assets.  However, the sale of State assets is not a decision for Government alone.  The previous Government sealed our fate in this regard.As the State currently has no other borrowing avenues available to it, the funds we require are being provided by the EU and IMF.  These funds do not come without conditions.  In return, we are required to have in place a credible programme to ensure the State's financial sustainability, with detailed conditions attached to the borrowings being set out in the memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the EU-IMF-ECB.  One of these conditions is that the State commits to a programme of asset disposal as part of the solution to the current fiscal crisis.  It is for these reasons that the Government has agreed to the sale of a minority stake in the ESB.  The Government is of course mindful of the need to ensure that this process is not detrimental to the continued future growth of the economy.  Having learned from past experience, the Government is determined that we will not relinquish control of any strategic assets without appropriate safeguards being put in place to ensure that investment in such assets is maintained at appropriate levels.In this context then there is a need to seek to reach an informed view as to what is actually strategic and essential to the national interest.  I welcome the views of the Deputies opposite in that regard.  For example, while I acknowledge that it can certainly be argued that ownership and control of electricity, gas and other utility transmission networks, such as water, is strategic, it is questionable whether outright 100% State ownership of these assets is required.  The same can be said for other areas of their businesses such as energy generation and supply.With such issues in mind, the review group on State assets and liabilities was established by the previous Government to examine the potential for asset disposals to relieve the State's growing debt burden and how the assets in State ownership could be best used to help growth and investment in the economy.  The assets focused on included the ESB, Bord Gáis, Coillte, Bord na Móna, Dublin Airport, the ports, RTE, CIE and An Post.Since its publication in April, the report's recommendations have been closely studied by the Government.  Having carefully considered all the options, it decided that, as an initial demonstration of intent, it would be prepared to sell a minority stake in the ESB as an integrated utility.  The Government believes by releasing value from this State asset, while still retaining ownership and control of the company, valuable resources can be freed up that can be put to productive use in the economy and help reduce debt levels.  However, the disposal will only be undertaken when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures are in place to protect consumer interests.  As Ministers have stated since the announcement of this decision, the State will not sell equity in the ESB at a fire sale price.My Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are jointly chairing an interdepartmental group which is considering the best approach to the sale of a minority stake in the ESB, taking into account energy policy, regulatory, legal, financial and economic considerations.  This group will report back to the Government by the end of November with a recommendation on the best option for a minority sale and also the timescale in which the sale will be completed.  No decision has yet been taken on the size of the minority stake to be sold or the amount to be generated from the sale.  These matters will be determined by the outcome of the process I have referred to and will take account of the need to strike a balance between achieving the highest possible return for the Exchequer and maintaining appropriate policy goals.The Government sees merit for the economy in retaining the ESB as a single unit.  The decision to sell a minority stake in the company as an integrated utility presumes that the Commission for Energy Regulation certifies compliance with EU directives for the ESB to retain ownership of the transmission network in the State and subsequent approval by the European Commission.  The process of seeking the necessary approvals in this regard is under way.  I am interested in hearing the views of the Members opposite if they believe the ESB should be held together as an integrated entity or whether the transmission lines should be disaggregated.  This may be a battle we may have to fight.The Government also agreed it is prepared, in principle, to undertake further asset sales but no decision has been taken on any other particular assets at this stage.  A separate process has, however, been initiated to value several potential assets in this context to inform any further decisions the Government may wish to make on this matter.In all of this, the Government is conscious more may need to be done than merely look for assets to sell to reduce our debt.  We also need to invest in the economy and restore competitiveness.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to release value from the State's portfolio of assets with the intention of using these proceeds to fund investment in the productive capacity of the economy.  It set a target of up to €2 billion in asset sales but only to be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests.One key issue that remains to be discussed with our funding partners on our asset disposal programme is how the proceeds of any asset disposals should be applied.  There is still strong resistance from our interlocutors not to apply them exclusively to debt retirement.

From the beginning when we took office, we have argued we want to apply a portion of the sales of those assets to investing in future jobs.  This is an ongoing point of engagement with the troika.The Government's policy of releasing value from State assets for productive investment in the economy and for debt reduction, while continuing to protect key assets of strategic importance to the economy, is an appropriate response to the enormous fiscal and economic challenges facing the economy.  It will also contribute to bringing about sustainability to the public finances and to fostering economic growth.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Minister has raised many issues.  While it would be easy for me to harangue the Government for what I consider is a bad decision on the sale of State assets, we must look at this rationally in the cold light of day and decide the best option.  I know the Minister in his heart and soul feels uncomfortable with the Government's decision.It must be clarified that the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding signed by the previous Government contains no commitment to or figure for the sale of State assets.  The MOU states, "the Government will undertake an independent assessment of the electricity and gas sectors with a view to enhancing their efficiency [a point we all agree with] with a view to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of State-owned assets".The first part of this was done by the McCarthy report on the privatisation of State assets.  During the summer when I was on so-called "holidays", I read the McCarthy report from beginning to end and its proposals for every company.  I often do not agree with what Mr. McCarthy writes but this report on privatisation was well written, useful and informative.What one finds from the report is a proposal to sell off, say, RTE's 2FM—it does not serve any great national purpose being just a pop station—would not realise any significant amount of money.  The report also referred to the National Stud, but again no significant moneys would be involved in its sale.Accordingly, after all the proposals were crystallised, the Government found out the only way to raise serious moneys would be to sell off the ESB.  No other sale would raise significant moneys in the context of State spending.  While I accept certain small parts of State businesses could be sold, the McCarthy report proved there is not a whole lot of ready cash in the State sector that could be realised to be invested in other sectors.  There is also no major source of moneys from the State sector without huge downsides.One example is Coillte Teoranta in which Coillte's crop is sold off but the land-holding is retained in State ownership, a rather neat arrangement.  I have had, however, dealings with Coillte wearing two hats, a commercial one, as manager of my local timber mill and a rural recreational one, when I was Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I found that, as an integrated company, Coillte Teoranta was able to marry its positive pursuit of timber industries with rural recreation, in which it was making a sizable investment for no direct fiscal return, on the grounds that doing so was in the national interest.  Some 45% of waymarked ways are through Coillte's lands.  Year in, year out, Coillte has invested in providing mountain bike trails and so on.Is the Minister telling me that, if Coillte owns the crop and wants to get it out, it will not assert that its job is not rural recreation, even for a marginal increase in return and no matter how much failure to do so will discommode the tourism industry we are building?  We have gone from 200,000 walkers to 500,000.  We are heading for 1 million.  Coillte will say this does not matter because it is a commercial company.  It will get the value and close the walkways.  We have been able to marry the two concerns under the current structure.We made a firm decision in government because we learned from past mistakes, particularly with Comhlucht Siúcra Éireann.  I was a Member of the Seanad at the time and the Minister is the only Member present who was a Deputy.  We were given all sorts of guarantees about golden shares, minority stakes and so on.  No matter what the Minister believes he will do or how good his intentions are, the situation will change once the Government starts selling parts of the transmission line.  Consider other cases.  If the Government sells 20% or 25%, two things will——

The Minister and I share similar views in this regard.  First, I have an antipathy towards the competition god of Europe, which is the real cause of the problem in the banks.  We can all blame one another, but the fundamental mistake was that, when the euro was set up, Europe watched governments' deficits but left the international banks alone.  The idea that we can control the banks from the Houses is simplistic.  The Bank of Scotland and a range of non-Irish banks are just as bad as the Irish banks.  Money came in thanks to the free market.  There was a fallacious belief that the free market and competition solved all problems.

Separating the network from the transmission system was mentioned, but I cannot see the logic.  Some of the 110 kV lines are considered transmission whereas others are considered network.  If transmission is different, large areas of the west technically have network lines and no transmission lines.  It is a fallacious argument.  As time passes, what is now network will become transmission because more power will start coming from wind farms in the west.The Minister's comments were right, but I hope he will reflect on my next remarks.  The minute the Government sells a stake, no matter how small, someone on the board can force every shareholder to say that the return on the capital is more important than any national interest.  The ESB has been helpful in ensuring the industrial price for electricity remains competitive.  When the construction industry collapsed and the timber mills hit the wall, Coillte adjusted prices and allowed our mills to return to the market.  After eight weeks, they were working flat out exporting timber.  Without a State entity to take a rational national view, this would not have been the case.I predict that, if the Government sells a minority stake——

If the Government sells 20%, the temptation to sell off another slice when it is short of money will be great.  Selling will be handy and painless compared with making cutbacks and raising extra taxes, and slice after slice will be sold off until the whole pie is gone.  All sorts of reasons will be given as to why this will work, but we will regret the decision five or ten years down the road.I was pleased to learn today that there would be no fire sales.  The Government will spend more than €200 billion in the next four years, yet this approach will only realise €2 billion.  I do not believe the Government's assertion that the troika is insisting on €2 billion.  If the troika has an ideological hang-up, all of us who believe in State enterprises must fight it.Before we take this route, people should read the McCarthy report carefully.  It shows how successful State enterprises are.  Consider the reinvention of Bord na Móna or Coillte, which uses its property in a better way than many private companies do.  Bord na Móna has created a new energy company that uses waste energy and so on.  It is a lie to claim that if money is taken from these companies and given to the private sector, the latter will create more jobs than the former.Will the Minister return to his colleagues and reflect on this matter?  They should reconsider their policy and avoid making a fatal mistake just to get short-term cash.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Minister's statement of reluctance to sell off State assets or parts thereof was genuine.  I urge him to listen to his instinct.  I urge his colleagues in government to do likewise.  This proposal is a classic case of short-term thinking.  Deputy Ó Cuív was right, in that the McCarthy report, if it did nothing else, shone a light on the commercial success of the semi-State sector in terms of dividends and taxes returned to the State and employment over a sustained period.  The report also reflected the fact that the companies' assets are not Johnny-come-latelies.  They have been built through generations of effort and investment by citizens.This was the best bit of the report.  Otherwise, it was a shoddy piece of work.  It suggested wholesale selling without a compelling argument as to how doing so would enhance the return to the State, our competitiveness, our infrastructure or employment opportunities.Other than his reluctance, the Minister also reminded the House of the need to address our €15 billion budgetary shortfall.  He is correct, but the question confronting us is whether the sale of State assets in whole or in part assists or hinders the process in the long term.  Sinn Féin is of the opinion that State assets must be kept in public ownership.  We do not argue this from a dogmatic ideological platform, but on a pragmatic basis.  In the energy sector, ESB and Bord Gáis are large, profitable organisations that we have not leveraged correctly in terms of infrastructural provision and employment opportunities.  We want the Government and the State to do this but the only way of doing so is to keep them 100% in public ownership.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Fine.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	193	In the course of the Minister's commentary he did not address the impact of a private stake in any of these entities.  Those who would choose to invest and become shareholders have a legitimate expectation of a return on their investment.  This is how it works and the Minister and I know it.  For the Minister to pretend this private profit-making interest would have no influence in the workings or strategy of a commercial semi-State body is disingenuous.  The Minister knows full well it would change the essential dynamic of these companies.The Minister asks whether the ESB specifically should be kept as a vertically integrated utility and the answer is absolutely yes.  The value of this company is precisely in the fact that it is integrated.  It is how the ESB has historically so successfully borrowed on the international markets and invested in its network and I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  The same goes for Bord Gáis.  The value in State companies is to keep them as coherent entities.  This is why they attract investment and why they are powerful companies.On several occasions when they have spoken on this matter, I have asked the Minister and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to pin down for us the exact distinction they make between strategic and non-strategic assets.  To date, they have not done so.  Let me give the Minister my view.  The ESB is strategic, and energy and electricity are strategic.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	194	No argument.

The Minister states the merit of his proposal is that the Government will still have a majority stake.  This seems to be the Minister's view.  I put it to him that the moment he introduces private shareholders into the equation the fundamental thrust of the organisation in terms of meeting the needs of the State in the strategic medium and long term is fatally undermined.  The Minister's approach is short term.  He made reference to the Eircom experience and we know what happened there.  We have seen this company asset stripped and sweated and its value literally collapse after privatisation.

The Minister is very unwise to have conceded to the troika that he would even consider the sale — and it would be a fire sale in these market conditions — of valuable State assets.  He pointed the finger at Fianna Fáil and I accept that Deputy Ó Cuív was dancing on the head of a pin so I will not argue with the Minister on this point.  However, the Minister is now in the job and he is a person from a party which historically has had a commitment to the commercial semi-State sector.  Irrespective of the view of the troika he needs to stand firm on this historical analysis because it is the correct one.  The Minister can choose to sell off parts of the semi-State bodies to yield a modest short-term payment some of which he may get to invest in jobs, or he can take the longer-term view and harness the capacities and potentials of these companies to serve the State and the citizens and no other master.The Minister tells us two processes are under way, one in respect of the ESB which will conclude at the end of November and the other to value assets.  Without wishing to be rude to the Minister——

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	199	——I am working on the assumption that the valuation of these assets is with an eye to taking a decision on whether to dispose of them in whole or in part.Let us return to first principles and remind ourselves why the likes of the Minister, the Labour Party and many others and successive Administrations have put such a value and emphasis on the commercial semi-State bodies.  It is because we have an understanding that the State has an obligation to its citizens to provide vital services.  It is because we have an understanding that for the strategic development of our country and economy the State must play an active role.  It is because we know when private capital and private interest enter the fray whether we intend it or not they distort those two objectives.  This scenario is no different now.Yes, we need to bridge our structural deficit and reduce the debt.  Above all, we need to get people back to work and get Ireland match-fit for indigenous enterprise and international investment.  A fire sale of these assets is not the way to do this.  It will not assist the process of recovery.  Rather, I put it to the Minister that it will prove to be the worst type of short-term politics opportunistically seized upon by some private investors.  I genuinely believe if the Minister proceeds down this path, given his stated reservations and discomfort with it, it will be a decision and process which not alone the Minister but the entire population will bitterly regret.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It is an absolute fallacy, repeated made by the larger party in government in particular.In reality, the State is a key employer of more than 300,000 people in the public sector and 45,000 in semi-State bodies.  It is a vital cog in job creation.  There is no such thing as a non-strategic State asset in my opinion.  All of these companies have historically played and at present play a vital role in our economic development in terms of providing relatively secure decent permanent employment, quality products and services, and regional development.  In the company where I worked, Aer Lingus, we made the point that the taxation revenue from the workforce alone was greater than all of the tax generated from the farming community, and the role of this community is never disputed.  The idea of selling a portion of these companies to raise funds to perhaps create jobs as the Minister stated is absolute nonsense.In the first case, the Minister admitted his masters have not even given him permission to do this and to use the money to do so.  Even if they had, it would be ridiculous because to use money to create jobs by a mechanism which inevitably leads to job losses, which privatisation always does  — and one may change the label but selling a stake in State assets is privatisation — would be absolute lunacy.  We very much reject the à la carte menu offered to us by the Minister of what type of privatisation we would like to see in the ESB, whether to sell off parts of it or a percentage of the whole.  We reject any of these options.  What the Minister is peddling is upside down economics.  He should be investing in these companies as a key driver of economic growth and recovery.

It makes me laugh to hear Fianna Fáil criticising the possible sale of State assets when they presided over Eircom, which was a disaster, led to 5,000 jobs being lost and to massive enrichment for Tony O'Reilly, Goldman Sachs, George Soros and all the rest of the vultures.  It is shameful for a Labour Party Minister and a Labour Party Government to stand over in any way or to justify the sale of State assets which the Minister knows has been a disaster in the past and which will do nothing but enrich corporate vultures, chief executive officers who will be getting inordinate salaries while at the same time resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs.  It is beyond debating.  What we need to do is to get out on the streets like the Greeks and the Americans and resist this.  It is shameful that the Labour Party should be part of it.

It would be a positive discussion if we were considering releasing the value of State assets and discussing how State assets and the semi-State companies could contribute to the development of the growth of the economy.  However, what we are really debating is the sale, which has been agreed, of a minority stake in the ESB and to bring a private interest into what is a valuable State asset.  This asset could be directed by this Government to work for the good and the development of the overall economy.  The ESB could be used to roll out fibre optic broadband to every house in the country.  It is the only utility with a physical connection to every property in the country.  This would provide world-class communications, something missing completely since Fianna Fáil sold off Eircom and destroyed any potential it had for the development of broadband infrastructure.  The Minister and the Government constantly question where the money will come from.  The ESB has shown that it can raise funds and it has carried out developments all over the world——

These people do not pay a ha'penny in wealth tax.  If they were in most other European countries they would pay a wealth tax and if they were in most states in the United States they would also pay a wealth tax but this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, like the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government before it, exempts those people from payment of a reasonable share of taxation.

He was a Fine Gael Minister for Finance and he introduced a wealth tax which was abolished afterwards by Fianna Fáil.  If that wealth tax was in place now at the rate of 2% as at the time, it would be bringing in €5 billion per year.  It is not unrealistic and it is most reasonable to suggest to these people with such large amounts of money that in addition to a wealth tax they should pay a once-off contribution to the State of about 10% of their assets.  This would amount to approximately €25 billion.  That kind of money and that kind of ongoing wealth tax——

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I welcome the ambition to keep the ESB together as a single unit and that only a minority share is being considered for sale.  There has been the usual emotive language from the Opposition with terms such as "fire sale" and "short-term benefits at the expense of long-term gain".  The opposite is the case.  This is a very measured approach, bearing in mind the commitment in the EU-IMF deal to sell State assets in order to repay our debts.We must acknowledge that the past six or seven months of this Government has changed the standing of Ireland within the European Union.  We have negotiated an interest rate reduction and the economy has experienced growth.  It must be accepted that after five years our unemployment levels are falling, albeit at a modest rate.  For the first time in many years, this gives the Government the opportunity to make the case to those in Europe and those who loaned us the money that it has the competence and vision to take a portion of the money that can be achieved from the sale of State assets and reinvest it within the economy.There has been much crazy economics cited in the debate, with figures of €5 billion touted and taking total values of wealth as if that is how taxation is secured.  The way to achieve the ultimate repayment of our debt is to do so through economic growth.  Rather than selling the assets and repaying the debt, we should continue to send the strong message that our Government is delivering — the troika is in Dublin as we speak — and that the ambition is to use moneys raised to secure further growth in the economy.  The semi-State sector has been extremely successful over many decades and there can and will be new job creation in new semi-State bodies that may be developed in the context of NewERA, which is ambitious and forward-thinking and the correct approach to take.  To suggest the Government has a policy of reducing the number of people employed in the semi-State sector is false.  The Government sees huge potential in developing new State agencies that will serve the people long into the future.The other issue is how we look at our State assets.  Over the past number of months there has been a considerable improvement in the number of foreign and domestic groups interested in coming and looking at these assets.  One of the more interesting proposals that has arisen recently is the suggestion of lease agreements, whereby the State could, at a reasonable value to the Exchequer, enter into agreements that would release money back to the State without fully disposing of the asset.  That suggestion, along with the report due in November — I welcome the haste with which the Department acted on this — should be considered in the context of the valuation being made of all of our State assets.The constant and persistent suggestion from Independent Members that the objective of the Government is anything other than patriotic is nonsense.  The Government is motivated by patriotism and is trying to pull the country back to be the first programme country of the three that will be released and will regain its sovereignty, as a result of the prudent and ambitious programme we are undertaking today.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Given the aspirations that have been voiced by some colleagues regarding the need to fund investment and job creation, the only question that matters is where we will get the money to do it.  In his contribution, Deputy Healy was honest enough to say that is the question that must be answered and he said he would answer it.  Some of his colleagues looked at him with concern and Members on this side looked at him with anticipation because they wonder where the money for all of this is to be found.  The answer trotted out was the introduction of a wealth tax here.  Let us be clear.  There is no economy in Europe that has put in place a wealth tax that has not resulted in the middle classes and any owners of property having to pay additional tax as a result.  That is the way a wealth tax is implemented.  The idea of introducing a new tax to tax wealth that is resident in Ireland is the kind of measure that will result in a further flight of deposits from our banking system, resulting in taxpayers being asked to cough up more to deal with that.  If that happened, those people on the Opposition side of the House would be the first to protest against the introduction of such a measure.A further incoherent suggestion came from Deputy Clare Daly.  She stood up and said that what we need to do is to get the semi-State bodies to fund job creation.  If it was as easy as that, why is that not being done currently?  There are two reasons that is not being done.  First, they cannot access and raise the funding and, second, if they go to the markets looking for funding, they need the support and funding of the State, which is not in a position to provide it.  She then put forward the suggestion that the pension funds could provide the funding.  However, she and others on that side of the House are the very people who argued and voted against the implementation of the pension levy, a levy which was designed to access funding from private pensions, some of the funding for which was enabled by pension tax reliefs from the State.  The Deputy voted against this levy saying it was a raid on private pensions, but now she stands up and says that is what she wants to happen.  That is incoherence.  It is incoherence on a point that is too important and serious to deal with.This was illustrated again by what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  He said we need to go down the Greek route and do what Greece is doing.  Let us look at what is happening in Greece.  It is on the verge of increasing its equivalent to VAT by three percentage points.  Who will suffer most from that?  It will be the very people the Deputy claims he wants to represent.  Greece is on the verge of suspending 30,000 members of the public service.  Is that the route the Deputy wants to take?  Is that what he advocates as the right course for us?  If it is, he should have the honesty to say so and to spell out the consequences.The Government recognise two things.  It recognises that the first thing we need to do is to reduce the total stock of debt with which the economy must deal.  However, let us be clear about the rhetoric.  It is being suggested here that the banks and the bailing out of the banks are what is driving this debt.  Of course, that is an element of it, but the €15 billion deficit of this State, a gap we must close this year, has nothing to do with the cost of bailing out the banks.  The banks are on top of that.  Next year, when we get into dealing with our budget deficit, there will be a portion of the deficit that will be driven by bailing out the banks and we accept that.  However, the majority of the deficit next year will be driven by the fact that there is an unsustainable gap between what we take in through taxation and what we spend.The question remains, a question the Opposition has failed to even try to answer, of where the money will come from to fund job creation and ensure our debt is paid down.  The Government recognises the tension and difficulty of doing this and is putting in place a process to reconcile the situation.  At least, it is putting forward answers that are coherent.  When we hear the same coming from the Opposition, we can then have a proper debate on the issue.

I am disappointed the Minister is not here, but I am sure he will be back to take questions.It is a sad day.  It is sad that we are here to talk about selling shares in the ESB, EirGrid, Bord Gáis, Coillte and Bord na Móna.  Each of these is a strategic asset.  The Minister will almost try and tell us that the provision of light, heat, fuel and power to people's homes and industry is not a strategic issue, but it certainly is.  Deputy Donohoe asked where the money would come from and I can answer him.  He said we should not take the Greek route because it is about to lay off 30,000 public servants.  That is precisely the number the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, proposes to lay off.  Perhaps the Minister should let the other parties in Government know that is what he is doing.

Another Labour Party Minister, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will be the front line Minister for the sale of some of these assets and we have a Minister of State from the Labour Party, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, here to take the flack on their behalf.  One only needs to ask anybody, not to mind one's supporters, whether he or she sees any sense in what is being done and the answer will be "No".I was here for an hour and a half of Question Time with the Minister on Tuesday and we had positive and good exchanges.  He said that what I had to say made sense and we agreed on a lot of things.  However, I do not agree with one syllable of what is proposed in this regard.

That should have been the red line issue on going into Government, but there was no red line because the Labour Party was so eager to get into government.  It is not necessary to sell these assets.  I accept from this side that mistakes were made in the past with selling the likes of Eircom, but it is important to learn from mistakes.We have learned and the Government should learn.  I accept that mistakes were made but one learns from the mistakes of the past.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has tried to confuse the issue of the EU a few times.  The current Minister for Finance has admitted that there was no commitment on the sale of State assets worth €2 billion in the memorandum of understanding signed in December 2010 by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  This figure arises solely from the programme for Government.  No figure was included in the original memorandum of understanding.  In the Dáil a week ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated:We included a figure of €2 billion in the programme for Government and intend to realise that sum.  However, we are obliged to negotiate with the troika on what we may do with the proceeds of the sale of State assets.The April memorandum of understanding, signed by this Government, stated: "It is important that we make effective use of our state assets and, where appropriate, dispose of them to help reduce our government debt."  That was what this Government voluntarily signed up to and it was not in the inherited agreement.  It is important to make this point.In a parliamentary question tabled during the week, Deputy Howlin referred to the interdepartmental group considering the best approach to the sale of shares in the ESB, which is working with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and stated: "A second group, to be led by my Department, has also been established to consider possible candidates for further assets sales."  The Minister did not make any reference to what he had in mind when he spoke earlier.I am amazed that I have to say this because I have great personal regard for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, but he was not candid or fully honest today.  I tried to get his script but, coincidentally, he did not have one.  We are amazed that on the subject of the sale of State assets, the Minister arrives in the Chamber without a script.  I think he was ashamed of the script that he would have had to read out.  I watched him closely on the monitor and he said that: "From the beginning when we took office, we have argued we want to apply a portion of the sales of those assets to investing in future jobs."  That is his line.  Is this true?  It is not true because the Minister is saying one thing and doing another.Another parliamentary question, answered by the Minister for Finance last night, refers to a matter I raised at the Committee of Public Accounts last week.  The question is about where the money comes from to finance these jobs and the answer is the sale of State assets.  I agree with that but it is a revelation to many people that on 25 July it was announced that €1.123 billion of the NPRF shareholding in Bank of Ireland was being disposed of.  On 28 July, the Minister issued a directive to the NPRF directing it to transfer the proceeds from the sale of those shares within five working days to the Exchequer.  That €1.123 billion is helping to reduce the State's asset and shareholding in Bank of Ireland, which I welcome.  It is good that Bank of Ireland is in a position to pay back some of the State involvement.  In his response to a parliamentary question last night, the Minister said that €233 million has been received to date and the €890 million is to be received this month, as confirmed by the NPRF at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting last Thursday.  The Minister saidThese net proceeds from the initial disposal have been classified as a capital receipt in the Exchequer account and they appear in Note 3 of the end-September Exchequer Statement which was published last week.  These receipts benefit the Exchequer finances through reducing the Exchequer deficit.Some €1.123 billion is available to the Government this month from the sale of State assets.  Why does the Government not use this money for job creation instead of using it to reduce debt?  Every time the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform speaks, he says he will use the proceeds of the sale of State assets to help create investment.  While he is busy saying that, the Minister for Finance is busy issuing directives in writing to raid the NPRF of €1.123 billion to reduce Government debt.  That was stated at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting the last week and was confirmed by the Minister.  Why does the Minister need to sell shares in the ESB when €1.123 billion is going into the State coffers this month alone?  It is not necessary and that is the answer to the question of where the funds come from.AIB, in which this State has a 99% shareholding, appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in September and said that it would dispose of shares in the company to reduce the State involvement.  That is a further sale of State assets and those funds should be used for the job creation fund.  We should not be raiding the ESB, EirGrid and Bord Gáis for that purpose.The Minister may find this a revolutionary theory but he should consider selling NAMA and the former Anglo Irish Bank now.  The people running both these organisations believe that, over a period of ten years, they might make a profit on it.  We should realise that profit rather than waiting ten years and paying consultants, accountants and the likes of Goldman Sachs.  NAMA has a future value.  It paid €30 billion for loans worth €71 billion, with a write-down of €58 billion.  The loans worth €30 billion should be converted to cash as soon as possible rather than featherbedding a whole industry for the next ten years at the taxpayers' expense.  The Government should bring forward the net present value of that future income stream and use the funds now.Reference was made to Greece.  If Greece receives a write-off of its debts, even if it is called burden sharing, there is no reason the Irish people cannot expect the same.  The banks contributed to the problem and, in response, the Government is attacking the ESB, Bord Gáis and EirGrid.  The Government is focusing on the wrong target and it should withdraw this crazy plan and come forward with a sensible plan.

The Deputies and Ministers of the previous Government destroyed our country and put our economy into rack and ruin.  They left us with over 440,000 people unemployed.  The positive, constructive debate that the country wants is coming from this side and I wish Deputy Fleming and his colleagues would wake up and make a constructive commitment to our country for a change.

Tens of thousands of households are in serious debt because of the way Fianna Fáil mismanaged and abused the privilege of government.  On this side of the House, we are not doing so and we are using the sale of some of our State assets, and in the case of the ESB a majority share in the company, to bring about more jobs.  It is about renewing our country and getting investment in our infrastructure.  That is what we are about and this does not just refer to the money we get from the sale of State assets.  We must also find willing partners in the marketplace to invest in our infrastructure.  This is about changing the way we do business rather than having the same old Fianna Fáil reaction and conservative thinking.  We want to change and we are driving change.  The NewERA authority, set up within the NTMA, is doing so.  A chief executive has been appointed and, as we speak, protocols are being set up between NewERA and Departments in order to ensure we maximise the potential of our country, our Department and our resources in order to take people off the dole, give them hope and stop them taking the boat or the plane to the UK, New Zealand, Canada, the USA or wherever they can get a job.  Not enough jobs are available here and it is about time we changed the debate.  It is about time we focused on what we can do with assets.  We can sell part of them to invest with other partners to create employment.  We are focusing on transforming our economy, notwithstanding the crisis we are in.  This is the most important time to do that.  Given the economic situation, it has never been cheaper to invest in our infrastructure.Significant investment is needed in our water infrastructure.  Visiting local authorities, including in Waterford last week, see the problems that exist.  We must upgrade our water infrastructure so that new businesses coming in — new employers coming to the Dublin area — will have proper and adequate supplies of water.  We will create thousands of jobs in renewing the water infrastructure but we on this side of the House want a buy-in from everybody.  We will have a full and proper debate on all of the issues with regard to NewERA and how we are going to change things.I was in Northern Ireland recently and saw that there will be fibre-optic broadband connections to every area by the middle of next year.  Northern Ireland is far ahead of us in its broadband infrastructure, although the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, is investing along with the private sector.  We will ask what the private sector will do and we will add what is required to make a difference in this country so that we have adequate broadband connections for our people and our industries.With regard to renewing our electricity grid, we have the best and most attractive wind energy potential, probably in the world but certainly in Europe.  We must establish wind farms, both on sea and on land.  We must change the way we do things.  By using part of the money from the sale of State assets to invest in this infrastructure, we can create thousands of jobs.  That is what this is all about.  It is not a dry theoretical argument from the extreme left or extreme right.  We are bringing about change and bringing people together by selling assets we have no need to hold on to, while retaining companies, such as the ESB, in State ownership to bring about the change that the former Government failed to achieve.  The Government's target is to create at least 100,000 jobs over its term in office.  NewERA is only a part of that, but it is an important part.  We want change and we are going to ensure it happens.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I share the passion of the Minister about where we are going.  Essentially, we are releasing the value of State assets.  So be it.  That is the situation we are in.  We borrowed a lot of money in this country and, as much as we would like to apply haircuts, it is not always appropriate.  I am in business myself, and the only haircut I want is when I go into town to get one.  I do not want any person with whom I am doing business asking me to take less money than I am owed because he or she made bad investments and used bad judgment.  If he or she cannot pay me, I cannot pay my staff.  It comes down to the basics in the end.We have been left in a situation in which we must realise the value of some of our assets.  Like any business, our priority must be to stay trading.  I am not sure why those in the Opposition do not understand this.  If we do not stay trading, we are gone.  It is much better to live to fight another day, and that is what this Government is trying to achieve.  I have had to do this, along with many other business people in this country.  We have had to sell things we did not want to sell but we are still around to trade.  Ten years is a long time, and in ten years' time we will look back and say that we got through the bad times and did so properly.The troika is in the country.  Is it not amazing that we can actually say that?  We do not have to pretend it is not here.  I remember, only a short while ago, people trying to guess whether it was here.  It is dealing with us in a constructive fashion.  We are not hiding behind anything.  According to a few articles I have read recently, it now considers us to be an example of how to get out of this mess, which is an achievement in itself.  Of course everybody will not agree on the method of achieving it but the spirit is correct.Investing in job creation is essential.  As I looked around here today and saw the children in the Visitors Gallery, I thought about my own children, who are that age, and I hoped we could make this right, because what is at stake is their future.  I doubt if they will care too much if we have sold a fraction of our State assets, as long as we are giving them a future in this country and allowing them to raise families as previous generations did before them.  If we have to do that in order to keep them at home and give them a future, so be it.Mistakes were made, as Deputy Fleming said.  One thing mistakes have is consequences, and the consequences of the mistakes made in this country were massive.  We cannot ignore these consequences, including increased unemployment and the mortgage and debt situation.  It is atrocious.  One of the difficulties is that the people who created this situation have not suffered enough.  There are many people who should be ashamed of what they have done.  Then again, there is no satisfaction in retribution; we need to move ahead.As much as I would like to criticise NAMA, it is doing quite well.  However, I would not sell all its assets immediately because to do so would crystallise losses.  Let us sit it out and play the long game, as any business would, because as soon as one starts distress selling, one is gone.  There is no more to lose.  We have assets that will be worth a lot of money in time — maybe in five years or ten years — and we cannot just hand them over.  In business, distress selling is the endgame, following which everything is gone.The Government is selling portions of our State assets, although it will retain control of them.  The semi-State bodies have proved their value over time and I am sure they will continue to do well.  If we do sell them, so be it.  In time, as the country recovers, we will develop other semi-State companies and move ahead.  People must realise that all we are doing here is making sure we can trade profitably into the future.  While the sale of assets may be repugnant to some, it is what happens in business every day of the week.  At the moment, it is happening in a lot of small businesses, which are selling things they never would have considered selling before to make sure they can stay trading.I commend the Minister for Finance on his approach.  The way in which the Taoiseach, along with the Minister, is dealing with the troika must be recognised.  From now, Europe will realise it is dealing with people who are straight and are not hiding in the shadows.

Having said that, I welcome this debate, which Sinn Féin has been seeking since the publication of the McCarthy report last April.  Already, as we debate this, the Government has declared its intention of selling off a stake in the ESB.  This week, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are engaged in talks with the EU and IMF to decide how many other State assets to sell off and where the money will be spent.  Sinn Féin is resolutely and firmly opposed to the sale of valuable State assets such as the ESB.  I have heard the arguments from the advocates of these sales, who say it will boost the State's revenues.  This is short-termist thinking.  It is the same short-termist thinking that our absent friends from the Labour Party rejected in their election——

Gabh mo leithscéal.  I note the Deputy's presence.  He may be interested to know what his party committed to.  Its election manifesto states:Labour is committed to [the] concept of public enterprise, and is determined to ensure that semi-state companies play a full role in the  recovery of the Irish economy.  Labour is opposed to short-termist privatisation of key state assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks.It is amazing.  That is what the party got a mandate to do, yet it is doing the opposite.  Looking at the examples of Eircom and the destruction of the Irish sugar industry, we can see the effect of such an approach.Presumably that was the motivation for the Labour Party's manifesto commitment and its reference to "short-termist privatisation".It is a scandal that the Irish people do not have the right to make their own decisions about how to handle this crisis.  Instead, our economic sovereignty has been handed over to the EU and the IMF.  This Government did not negotiate that deal, but it is faithfully implementing it.  It is adhering to the so-called austerity policy which serves to deepen the recession and has victimised citizens on low and middle incomes.  One can see the effects of that in the numbers of patients on trolleys, chairs and even on the floors of accident and emergency departments.  One can see the outcome in our classrooms where children are deprived of special needs assistants.  One can see the consequences in our airports where thousands of young people are fleeing the country.  The result of mounting job losses was clear in the attendance at Ireland's rugby games at the World Cup in New Zealand.  Yet Fine Gael and the Labour Party plough ahead with their sleveen policies of recapitalising toxic banks and slashing public spending.  On 2 November the Government will give €7 million to the toxic institution formerly known as Anglo Irish Bank.Now we are presented with a plan to sell off State assets.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to target up to €2 billion in sales of what were described as non-strategic State assets.  However, the EU and the IMF are now demanding that this be increased to €5 billion in order to pay the debts of private bankers and speculators.  It is beyond comprehension that the Government is claiming that praise from the troika for its efforts is an achievement in itself.

We must seek a different way to the short-termism that has marked the performance of this Government.  What is at stake is our very survival as an island nation.Bord na Móna, An Bord Gáis and the ESB are profitable companies with a clear strategic importance.  A partial sale will be the first step towards full privatisation, with inevitable job losses and increased costs for consumers.  The consequences of the privatisation of critical infrastructure can be seen in the experience of our nearest neighbour.  The sale of Royal Mail, for example, was such a disaster that it had to be returned to state ownership.  The privatisation of British Rail came at enormous cost and was executed so poorly that some have argued it literally cost lives because there was no proper maintenance of the railway lines.  In any sale of strategic State assets, companies will come in to strip assets and secure profits, not to invest in what should be a public service entitlement.

There has been much discussion about the concept of sovereignty, a word which has been regularly bandied about in recent years.  "Sovereignty" has different meanings for different people.  However, it is generally understood to refer to a state's ability to control its own destiny, have all its own resources at its disposal and control its future direction without undue regard to the requirements of external authorities.  Unfortunately, this  country has become indebted to such an extent that it has not been possible to proceed in the normal fashion.  All the wringing of hands, tearing of hair and agonised appeals from the opposite side of the House in an attempt to tweak at the heart strings of hard-pressed citizens amounts to nothing but total and utter hypocrisy.Everybody in this House well knows that the current desperate economic circumstances require desperate measures.  These are measures which the Government takes no pleasure in implementing but which are not within the gift of the Government, on behalf of the people, to refuse to take.  We are simply now victims of circumstances.  The people did not cause this problem.  Some modern economic thinkers knew what was happening, allowed it to happen and allowed it to get worse.  Some people in the political arena who should have known better did not ask questions in time and allowed the situation to deteriorate.  The disposal of State assets is not a desirable objective for anybody, but we are in a desperate situation.Burning bondholders is not the way to go.  One cannot go into a bank and tell the bank manager, "By the way, I intend to burn the bond.  I intend not to repay you" and at the same time expect to have a budget position addressed over the next four, five or ten years.  People must come into the real world.  The reality is that nobody does business with people who talk like that and anybody who believes that confidence will be generated by people who talk like that must think again.As a result of past experiences, and we are aware of the experiences throughout Europe, the United Kingdom and in the other part of this island in recent years, I am one of those people who would be very reluctant to dispose of State assets but we are in a desperate situation and what do we do?  Do we do nothing?  Do we stand idly by and allow matters to progress to a point where we will have default in some quarter?  I am aware that is a desirable objective in some quarters but I do not believe it is a desirable objective.  We must re-establish our credibility in a way never known previously and the proposed disposal of non-strategic State assets is not an erosion of our sovereignty, our nationalism or our ability to look after our own affairs.  It is out of necessity and we should do as little as possible to achieve that but we must do what is required.  If we do not do what is required we will be criticised further down the road, fail in our task and as a result pay an even higher price.Now that the experiences of the past number of years are behind us, we should take whatever decisions are necessary to achieve the maximum in terms of targets to be achieved in the shortest possible time so as not to prolong indefinitely the agony and the burden on the people of this country, its institutions and its industry.  To do so would be the greatest tragedy of all time.We should be very careful what we dispose of.  We should retain maximum collateral in the current position because collateral is hugely important, as anybody who borrows from a financial institution is aware.  We should examine carefully the proposals announced so far with the intention of ensuring our credibility is restored in the European and international arenas and that we do not cause a prolonging of the difficulties and the burden on the people through failure to take action.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I welcome the opportunity to speak on such an important topic.  This morning in the House the Minister, Deputy Howlin, while taking Leaders Questions, stated that the absolute objective of this sovereign Parliament is to win back economic sovereignty for this country.  Every Member in this House is well aware of the difficulties facing this country.  This country lost its economic sovereignty when the IMF came to town and that is the context in which anybody should make a comment on how we get out of that position.  It is the objective of this Government to win back economic sovereignty for this country and in doing that, one of the first tasks of this Government was to renegotiate the EU-IMF deal.  The Government did that, and with a good degree of success.  It has extended the term and renegotiated the interest rate.An absolute feature of that deal, which the previous Government signed us up to, was a sale of State assets.  Nobody wants to sell State assets but implicit in the agreement was a condition that State assets would be sold and moneys accruing from that sale would be used to pay off the debt.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, have renegotiated that with the troika and they are now in a position where the proceeds from those sales or potential sales will go back into job creation.  Job creation is the one element of Government policy that must and will dominate the reign of this Government because as long as this country has 450,000 people out of work the economic position will not improve.  We must examine that and acknowledge the renegotiation of the EU-IMF deal and realise we are not in a position of our own making.  We are in government to renew economic sovereignty.  Achieving that will be difficult.  Nobody wants to make decisions in this House that will impact on people who have suffered enough at the hands of the economic collapse but to win back economic sovereignty difficult decisions will have to be made, and rhetoric and economic lunacy from detractors only serves to ill-inform the entire debate.Yesterday the Keane report on mortgage arrears marked a major milestone in terms of how we can address the problem of the thousands of people experiencing mortgage difficulty.  Thousands of people find themselves in situations not of their own making.  They have lost their jobs.  They are now dependent on social welfare.  Their incomes have been depleted.  Their morale is gone and the banks want to take their houses from them but being in a position to initiate consultation and bring about a policy that addresses the problem is another aspect of Government policy that must be acknowledged.Last month Olli Rehn stated that he thought the programme countries which sold assets should be allowed invest some of it in job creation.  That emphasises my point that there has been a substantial tweaking of the deal to allow the Government reinvest moneys into job creation.The establishment of NewERA, another significant pre-election commitment that is now Government policy, seeks to address the issue of unemployment.  The strategic investment fund, another key pre-election commitment, is now being realised and will provide money for small and medium sized enterprises, get credit going and give back to small businesses the lifeblood of the availability of freely flowing credit.We must remind ourselves that there are a number of positives about the economy because it is too easy to get lost in the negativity.  There are indications that the economy is heading into a bright spot and it is borne out by recent data that shows exports hitting an all-time peak in the second quarter of the year while GDP, GNP and domestic demand all expanded in the same quarter.I want to focus on the hypocrisy in the contribution of a previous speaker.  I remind Deputy Adams that when he was an MP in West Belfast he represented an area with the highest rate of unemployment in Europe and what did he do?  He abandoned it.  He came down to Louth to stand for election in the Republic.  That is the commitment that man has shown the unemployed in West Belfast.  I will take no lectures from a party which has initiated legislation in the North to privatise ports.  Private Members' business yesterday evening in this House was on the community and voluntary sector.  I read into the record the number of jobs that party, with its coalition partners, the DUP, has cost voluntary and community sectors in the North of Ireland.  It is engaged in austerity measures of £4 billion and its members have the temerity and cheek to come in here and start criticising Government at every possible juncture.Reasoned, rational and constructive debate based on sound economic policies is what is required to deal with this issue.  If we follow Sinn Féin economics the troika will abandon this country, there will not be anything in this country and we might as well give the key back to Brussels.

The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in particular admitted that the sale of State assets is not an ideal position.  We know Fine Gael's position because in The Irish Times this day last year its finance spokesperson stated he was in favour of selling State assets, that Ireland could no longer pay for inefficient State monopolies and that 40,000 public sector jobs would have to be cut.  There is no doubt about the Fine Gael position.  The doubt is about the Labour Party position.  I have listened to the only contributor from the Labour Party in addition to the Minister.  It is all about attack and not about dealing with what is not ideal.

I heard the Minister say that the State would retain some State involvement, however, "some State involvement" is not the same as "owning".  When challenged, he said also that this was not privatisation.  Are we going to sell something and yet keep it?  I would like to hear how one can do that.Valuable assets are those that are worth selling.  That is the difficulty.  The ESB is a strategic asset and by breaking it into component parts, one brings people into the boardroom to strip the assets.  I want to hear from the Labour Party, because every day its backbenchers are fulfilling a role of being either cheerleaders or hecklers.  This is a significant issue for people of the left.We will get our sovereignty back in time but we need to know the type of country we will inherit.  We are taking dangerous short-term decisions on very important assets.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said about an hour ago that we have to sell these assets as it was one of the conditions that came with the IMF money.  This must be the most successful and costly con job in the history of the world.  We, the Irish people bail out European financial institutions.  The Europeans lend us the money to do it and in return we give them full control of our country.  It is absolute madness.In the short time I have, I will address the ideological debate on whether State organisations such as the ESB should be run or owned by the public sector or the private sector.  On the left we have this sense that the private sector in somehow inherently bad and any private sector investment will cause cataclysmic failure across our country.  The position of the right is that only the private sector can bring real efficiency, the public sector is inherently inefficient and wasteful and therefore should not be let run these businesses.  There is evidence for both positions.  We see clearly from the sale of Eircom that the private sector, unregulated and left to its own devices will strip assets and under invest in strategic infrastructure in the country.  Let us look at the ESB which is publicly owned.  The ESB provides us with some of the most expensive electricity in the country and in doing so takes that money and pays its workers some of the highest utility wages in the world.  Members make the point that the ESB needs to be protected because it is profitable.  It is profitable because it charges the people so much money.  I would like us to move beyond this debate and consider what we are looking for from State assets.  We are looking for value for money, high quality services and good jobs.  Both the private sector and the public sector are capable of doing this.  The debate on strategic and non-strategic assets is incorrect in my opinion.  Our farms are pretty strategic, they are successfully privately run; our mobile telephone network is strategic and is successfully privately run.  The ESB is strategic and in my opinion is not successfully run because it charges people too much for what it provides.  We need to move beyond this.  I would like to make three suggestions to the Government.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The analogy of the family silver is often used when discussing State assets.  If my family were starving I would certainly consider selling the family silver, if I had any, but I do not think of our State assets in terms of the family silver but of the bread and butter we need for our survival.  I hope when we are discussing this matter, it will not be a knee jerk reaction looking for a quick fix solution and that future generations will be taken into account in any decisions that will be made.  I do not believe the nation agrees with selling our State assets.  The 2011 TASC Equality Survey shows one in three agreed with the privatisation of State assets and 42% were in strong disagreement.  The director said that instead of merely focusing on potential once off yields, the privatisation debate needs to focus on the full costs and benefits to the public and the economy.  The calculations must comprise the triple bottom line of economic, environment and social costs and benefits.  The once off benefit from such sales must be balanced against risks, of which there are three: higher energy costs, lost income streams and reduced employment.  Those risks are real.  We do not want higher prices for essential services, we do not want more people to lose their jobs and we do not want to throw away potential income.Mistakes were made by Eircom and the country lost out.  We could do without a repetition.  The wishes of the elected representatives on Dublin City Council are being ignored by the executive in order to privatise waste services.  If privatisation goes ahead what type of regulation can there be with a cap on salaries and so on, or will the company be given carte blanche with the public ending up paying, as we see happening in Britain where private operators have abused the situation of privatisation?I come to the two "C" words, Coillte and Corrib.  We have made so many mistakes in both of these situations.  With Corrib gas, we have thrown away approximately €8 billion of what is a valuable asset to the country.  When we compare what the Nordic countries have gained from their natural resources, let us not give away the other hydrocarbon deposits in Rockall and the Porcupine Basin.  If a multinational private company from outside this country buys our strategic assets, can they be trusted to have the best interests of this country at heart?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Some of this debate is somewhat sterile, old hat and irrelevant.  It seems to me quite simple that the old ideologies and jargon should not be used.  The very word privatisation is a pejorative term.  It immediately says that you are handing over an asset which will make a profit on the backs of the staff who have worked very hard.  It is a purely pragmatic decision on behalf of the Government.  I accept that it does not want to sell any State assets.  It would be preferable in many ways if it did not sell them, but those of us who are not naturally in favour of nationalisation would be very happy and are very happy to see the banks in the hands of the Government, because it was necessary.  It was pragmatic and the only decision that could be made at the time.  It is only ten years ago since we were selling banks rather than buying them, we were selling ICC and ACC and that might have been the right thing to do at the time, because we could raise a great deal of money for those banks and at the time it was fashionable to believe the State should have no business in the banks when they were prospering in that way.  Now we have a situation where the private sector is being demonised in this debate.  It is fair to say there is a lot wrong with what happens in the private sector, but we are seeing the battle between two almost irreconcilable forces.  When the private sector buys it will be looking for one thing and one thing only, that is profit.  It will not be looking to keep the staff there, to feather bed anybody, it will be looking for profit.  The way a private company looks at a State asset is quite simple, it wants to generate profits from what it buys and will do what is necessary to get it.  The reluctance on the part of people on this side and the Labour Party to selling any assets is because they see that those who come in to make that profit will lay off people, cut costs and damage the welfare of people who have lived well off the State assets for many years.  That is an almost irreconcilable difficulty.  There are arguments on both sides.  The State assets that are for sale are feather bedded to some extent.  The first piece of advice the Government should take, but it will not take, is that one does not sell a minority stake if one is looking for the maximum amount of money.Anybody buying 25% of whatever part of the ESB is for sale will say he or she will be locked into a Government with a non-commercial mandate in a monopoly situation.  That means people would be buying at a discount.  The Government cannot possibly get the maximum value out of what it is selling because it is not selling enough to take the people who want to buy out of what they regard as the captivity of the State.The sum of the parts of all the assets is greater than buying a little bit of them.  In debates of this sort I appeal for people to look on the sale of State assets as pragmatic and consider them one by one.  I am quite happy to see the State take over assets, such as happened with the banks, or sell them if it is the logical and absolutely necessary thing to do.  I sympathise with the Government.  It has to raise money.  It is not a palatable situation.  I wish it well but it is not going about it the right way because it is selling too little.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I come to this debate with a slightly different perspective from some of the comments.  I do not make the case that the motivation for the consideration of the sale of the State assets is because we are forced into it or are being required to do so by the troika.I, along with a number of colleagues in Fine Gael, spent a lot of time in opposition examining the basket of State assets.  We tried to assess them, particularly those involved in energy and telecommunications and natural resources such as forestry.  We tried to determine whether the current cluster of State assets was appropriate for a modern economy and if we needed to reconfigure them or add to or subtract from them, as appropriate.  We considered whether we needed to sell some assets which were no longer required to be a monopoly or under State control and if we could realise some value from them in order to raise money which could then be invested in building new assets which the State needs to own for strategic reasons.The philosophy of NewERA is not centred on raising money to pay off debt, rather it is about trying to assess what the State needs to own for strategic reasons.  People will question the use of the word "strategic" in terms of how one defines it.  The ESB includes an infrastructure to carry electricity in Ireland, whether it is a network or grid.  It is a monopoly and it makes sense to keep it in State ownership and regulate it aggressively to make sure we get good value for people who use it.In terms of the arguments on the generation of power and driving efficiencies, I have no hangups about public or private ownership.  I do not approach the issue from an ideological point of view, rather I have a pragmatic point of view, namely, examining all our State assets, deciding what the economy needs now and what it will need in five or ten years' time and what makes sense to have under the control, management and regulation of the State and what can be done better by the private sector because of the competitive forces that can drive efficiencies and so on.This is about reconfiguring, not selling off, State assets, in order that we can raise money to build new ones when and where it is appropriate, or add to them in the case of the electricity network.  We need to have an honest conversation about what the State should be doing in the interests of shareholders, namely, the public, rather than in the interests of people currently working with State-owned companies.  Ultimately, that is what this is about.  The role of the ESB is to provide power safely, efficiently and consistently to the country and it has done some of that very well.  There are questions in terms of some of the efficiencies in delivering electricity in as affordable and competitive a way, from a pricing point of view, as possible.I am Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Following the publication of the McCarthy report, I asked Deloitte on a pro bono basis to examine the recommendations in terms of what assets should remain in State ownership and what would realise some value without compromising the strategic ownership position of the State.The only asset worth anything substantial in my portfolio is Coillte.  I have made no secret of the fact that we are considering whether we should realise some of its value while holding on to the strategic elements the State currently owns.  I want to debunk a number of myths.  Nobody is considering selling Coillte and all of the land it controls.  It owns 7% of the land mass of Ireland and there is no question that the Government is considering the sale of any of that land.We have made clear that where there is a public access value to the land, which is an important strategic value for the State, it would also be maintained.  What is being considered is whether the State would sell one, two or three crops of commercial timber and realise the value now for a harvest period at some stage in the future.  Commercial timber has a significant value internationally and there is no question of a crash sale without realising its full value.  We are considering maintaining the strategic ownership of Coillte where it makes sense on a commercial and social basis.

The points I want to make echo those made by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.This discussion is not about the sale of parts of State assets, rather it is about changing the different companies and businesses in which the State is involved and realising some of the value that currently exists within them and setting up new enterprises for the State to be involved in in the future.  In fairness to Sinn Féin, it has been consistent in its approach in the Twenty-six Counties.  It might have a different attitude in Northern Ireland to the sale of State assets.I listened to Deputy Fleming, whom I like and admire.  However, the somersaults in logic he made while trying to convert the Fianna Fáil position from one of favouring the wholesale sale of State assets to being opposed to the sale of anything to do with the ESB, while at the same time stating we should put NAMA, Anglo Irish Bank and the banks back into private ownership, was mind blowing.A constituent contacted me to tell me perhaps we could sell Fianna Fáil into private ownership but I do not think we would realise very much value for it.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	308	While I like and admire Deputy Fleming, to get a lecture from Fianna Fáil on the disposal of State assets when it was responsible for the sale of Eircom, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan and others, is nonsense.  It was possibly the most unsuccessful privatisation in this country and perhaps anywhere in Europe.  There was a cataclysmic failure to separate the network from the business, which has exacerbated our difficulties with broadband.  Perhaps Deputy Fleming will have another opportunity to explain what he means when he refers to selling NAMA and Anglo Irish Bank into private ownership.He also referred to selling our shares in the bank and using the money to create jobs.  It will be used to repay the money borrowed by the previous Government to put into the banks in the first place.  I salute the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  One of the most significant renegotiations they have done with the IMF and the ECB is ensuring whatever money we realise from the sale or partial sale of State assets can be reinvested in creating jobs.That was the legacy they were left with in the deal negotiated less than a year ago and I congratulate them for ensuring the renegotiation has happened.  It is also strange that members of the previous Government would criticise the selling off of part of our existing State assets to the tune of €2 billion when it was proposing to sell off up to €5 billion.  That was Fianna Fáil's stated position until a number of months ago.I agree with Deputy Stephen Donnelly's comments that the State must figure out where the value lies, and with Deputy Tom Barry's remarks on ensuring we do not sell assets at greatly decreased values.  We must think strategically to ensure we get the greatest possible return under the proposals.  I welcome the fresh thinking from the Government on this initiative and the idea that the semi-State sector is not static, that there are new areas where the State can get involved that will help people get back to work.

I agree with remarks on Coillte made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I fully understand the Fine Gael position but I cannot fathom the Labour Party's support for it, it has walked away from its people.  I accept this is what Fine Gael is about, it is part of its rationale but it is not part of the Labour Party's psyche nor any of its voters.  The Minister said on Coillte that the Government would sell future crops that will produce money down the road while getting the net present value.

I appeal to the Minister when he is looking at assets to look at the State's financial assets.  We own 99% of AIB.  The chief executive of the bank was before the Oireachtas committee recently and he said they want to dispose of some of it to gradually come back into private ownership.  It should not be a State asset but it had to be nationalised.  We will not go into that debate now.

Perhaps the Minister thinks we should not have nationalised it and it should have been closed down.  If he wants to say that, that is fine.There are shares to be sold in AIB and there are shares being sold in Bank of Ireland.  If the sale of assets in such a bank is worth a lot to the Exchequer, could that money not be used to fund the economic development programme we all want to see, as opposed to selling off ESB assets?The people in NAMA say over the next ten years, the agency will turn a profit.  Precisely the same logic exists as exists for Coillte.  If money is to be found in NAMA in the next ten years, why not get the net present value now for the benefit of the taxpayer and to create jobs, instead of waiting for the money to come in dribs and drabs over the next ten years?  The same goes for Anglo Irish Bank.  The proceeds from the sale of State assets should go to job creation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The only decision the Government has made on the sale of any State assets, having taken months to ask each line Department to look in detail at the McCarthy recommendations, and beyond it to their own view so we could have an agenda for rational decisions in the interests of the State, is to sell a minority share-holding in ESB.  The second decision we made was to ask a structure we set up to look at the value of a range of other State assets.  A difficulty for my Department when bringing proposals to Government was to get a true market value of anything.  There is no point debating the sale of an asset if we did not have the true market value.  That is what we are trying to discern before we decide on anything else.The Government decision excluded the financial sector deleveraging.  That will happen in any event.  Under the decision we have already made in March to restructure the banks, we put in a considerable amount of capital, considerably less than we feared, thankfully, after the recapitalisation process.  We have also required the banks to do an extraordinary amount of deleveraging.  The Anglo Irish Bank portfolio in the United States to the value of $10 billion is being deleveraged.  However, if the Deputy thinks we will get value for the bank shares the State owns right now, he would be wrong.  We must establish the two pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.It is good that Bank of Ireland managed to secure considerable private sector investment during the summer, which lessened the need for additional capital from the State, so it has reduced the overall take of share-holding the State might have had in the bank.  In the longer term, it is the Government's intention to have private sector banks.  Neither party in Government, no matter what their traditions are, is of the view that having a State-owned banking sector is the best way for the economy to move forward.There are two parallel processes.  First there is the requirement in the Government decision to sell some State assets up the value of €2 billion in accordance with the programme for Government.  We must deal with the troika and there will be questions about how we can use that money.  The second is the process of restructuring the banking system, ensuring we have a functioning system that can lend into the economy and, in due course, get as much back for the State as possible when share values recover.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I am bemused at the Minister's answer that we would not realise the value of the State's shares in the banks at present.  Is the Minister not aware that during the summer — this arose at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and in a response to a question to the Minister for Finance last night — the Government sold €1.123 billion worth of Bank of Ireland shares and that the proceeds went to the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  The Minister issued the letter at the end of July to authorise the NPRF to transfer the proceeds to the Exchequer.   The Minister stated in his reply to the parliamentary questions that these receipts benefit the Exchequer's finances by reducing the Exchequer deficit.  During the summer, €233 million was received and we were told at the meeting of the PAC last week that the balance, amounting to €890 million, is to be received this month.  For the Minister to say we would not realise the value of the State's shares in Bank of Ireland patently ignores the fact that is precisely what the Government has been doing.

The Government claims the State cannot realise the value of its shares but it is doing the opposite.  I am glad the Government got €1.123 billion and reduced the State share-holding in Bank of Ireland.There was nothing in the memorandum of understanding we signed last December about using the proceeds of State assets.   The memorandum of understanding the Government renegotiated in April said, "It is important that we make effective use of State assets and, where appropriate, dispose of them to help reduce our Government debt".  That is the decision the Government made in March of this year.  The money from the sale of State assets will go into the National Pension Reserve Fund not into the banks.  Can the Government not ask the troika if, when it does dispose of State assets, the money can be used to stimulate economic growth?

Let me try to explain.  We are dealing with the sale of State assets and the restructuring of the banking system as two distinct processes.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Let me explain.  I do not know if the Deputy wants to hear the explanation or not.  The Government made a strategic decision to seek external funding for the banking system.  I commend the officials of the Department of Finance, who did extraordinary work throughout the summer to get that private sector investment into the banks.  The week before that strategic investment was made the commentary in the media was that it would be impossible to get private sector investment in the Irish banking system.  It was an extraordinarily difficult negotiation because any potential investor wanted residual guarantees from the State.  None was given.  This was a pure investment.  The week after the investment, the criticism was that we had given the shares away cheaply.  It is very hard to get things right in the public view.  We probably could have sold a bigger stakeholding at that stage, but we want to ensure that the residual State stakeholding gets best value.One could argue that we should have held off and not sought private sector investment because we would not get best value for the State shareholding we relinquished.  I would be happy to argue that point but I am sure the Minister for Finance will do so more effectively than I.  It was extremely important, particularly at that moment, to show that it was possible to get private sector investment in the Irish banking system.  That act of confidence has been extremely important in the international narrative of banking in this State.  It does not mean we should release further State equity in the banking system now, if we believe the potential is for a much greater gain to the State in the medium term.  That is the strategic thinking of the Government on banks shareholding.

One of the problems with this debate has been that Deputies on the Government benches have talked about everything, even the price of tea in China, except State assets.  With the exception of the Minister, who addressed the issue head-on——

The Minister makes the point that the Government would not realise the value of bank shares at present, given market conditions.  Let us take that at face value.  What makes him think he will get a correct valuation for the proposed sale of State assets?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	326	We are testing that now.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	327	In his own mind, the Minister is working from a position of vulnerability and pressure.  He has conceded that point.  First, we have heard no compelling case for partial privatisation of the assets.  Second, the Minister has conceded that he is taking this option from a position of weakness.  Third, his colleagues on the Government backbenches believe the Government has sealed a deal with the troika to use the proceeds of privatisation for investment in jobs.  Earlier in this debate, the Minister made it plain that is not the case.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Can I explain it again?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I will try to be as expansive and as clear and open as I can be.Negotiations are taking place between the troika and our officials today and will take place between the troika and the Minister for Finance and myself tomorrow.  It may be poor strategy to hold negotiations in parallel with a debate in Parliament.  Nevertheless, we should answer direct questions directly.A view was expressed by the troika from the very beginning of our negotiations, when we first came into government, that any State assets had to be used to retire debt.  We trenchantly put it on the agenda from the beginning that we wanted, in accordance with the NewERA proposals, to deleverage money.  I am bemused by some comments from the Opposition backbenches which assume that there are endless capital resources available.  Capital to invest in jobs is very scarce.  If we can get some capital to invest in jobs it will be an extremely important component part of our economic strategy.Deputy Fleming is correct when he says the actual signed memorandum did not move this issue on.  We had an understanding with the troika, as the Taoiseach indicated to the House, that they would be willing to listen to proposals for sensible investment on a case-by-case basis.  That position has hardened somewhat because the same conditionality has applied to other countries.  I do not think I should be more expansive than that because I do not want to weaken my negotiating position.  The Government is anxious that we would have the capacity to use some of the money we get from the sale of State assets to invest in jobs and growth.I will deal with the other issues when I contribute again.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Given that the Government has not sealed that deal, the Minister needs to tell his backbenchers that it is not a done deal.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Whatever about the generalised understanding, was it not very unwise to make a concrete commitment for the sum of €2 billion before, at a very minimum, securing that understanding with the troika?  I am opposed to what the Government is proposing to do.  I think it is crazy.  In the medium and long term it does not add up.  However, even accepting the Government's rationale, the Minister has gone about matters in a most bizarre way.  To concede that we would enter into a programme of privatisation and to concede a figure of €2 billion, with €5 billion echoing in his head from the troika, without having first had the conversation and hammered out the deal that some or all of the proceeds would go into job creation seems to be an inept approach.The ESB has always been in a position to raise funds internationally and to upgrade and invest in its infrastructure.  Can the Minister confirm that to the House, and to some of his party colleagues?  They seek to ignore the view that this is a profitable company with international prestige and a borrowing capacity.  They appear to view it as a type of shackle on the Exchequer.  The Minister needs to make clear as this debate advances that that is not and never was the case.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	339	Will the Government sell off less than 50% of it?

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Perhaps 40%.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Will the Government establish what it believes to be a fair price in this regard and will it, if that cannot be achieved, refuse to sell?  It is not rocket science that this is not a good time to sell.  It will be hard to get real value for a minority stake in the ESB, just as it is hard to get value in respect of anything in this country at this time.  I know that only too well.  Will the Government set a figure below which sale of this minority stake would not make sense?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I will try to respond to the questions asked by Deputies McDonald and Wallace.  On the ESB's capacity to borrow, the ESB is a flagship company which has a great record.  However, it, no less than any other State company, is impaired by the impairment of the sovereign, which casts a shadow on the capacity to borrow of each State company that is part of the State apparatus.  I do not wish to say any more than that.  It would be economically naive to think that impairment of the State would not have a consequence for State companies and their capacity to obtain investment funds, as they did previously when Ireland was AAA rated as a sovereign.  That response is in respect of the point of view put forward by both Deputies.As regards the process, I do not believe people have read the Government statement which states that it has decided in principle to sell a minority shareholding in the ESB to deleverage up to €2 billion.  The Government will work to see if a portion of that can be used to invest in the next round of State jobs.  We have set up a process to do this, which is co-chaired by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We are examining all the regulatory frameworks in this regard.  There are regulatory issues involved because the decision of the Government to keep the ESB as an integrated entity requires the energy regulator to accept the proposal and permission from the European Commission.  This has not yet been done.  We will have all of this fundamental work completed and a report back to Government by end of November, including a proper valuation, regulatory framework and timing assessment.In response to Deputy Wallace's specific question, let it be crystal clear that if we do not get value for any State asset we will not sell.  There will be no fire sale of any asset.  We are not time bound to get bad value for this country and taxpayer.  That will not be done.  I hope I have answered the Deputies' questions in regard to process.  I reject the notion that we could have done things in another way.  One first makes a decision in principle and then decides whether it is feasible to go that road.  If ultimately we go a different road we will explain that to Members.  We have not and will not sign any deal.  Members will be aware that every decision made by this Government has been in the interests of taxpayers.  We have come a long way from the abyss in which we found ourselves upon taking up office.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	344	As it is now 1.25 p.m. I call on the Minister to make a statement in reply to the debate.  The Minister has five minutes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  While I was in the House to hear most of them I had to leave on a couple of occasions to make some telephone calls.By and large, people know the position of Government, which has been set out from the beginning.  Reference was made to the Labour Party's position.  The Labour Party is part of a Coalition Government that negotiated a framework and programme for Government.  Not all of the views of the Labour Party or of Fine Gael are replicated in that programme for Government.  It is an agreed programme, the fundamental driver of which is the economic regeneration of our country.I will try now to respond to some of the welcome contributions made.  I welcome the contributions of all Members whom I believe speak from the heart in terms of their strong views on these matters, as do I.  Deputy Ó Cuív spoke about my personal reluctance in regard to what is being proposed.  The Deputy is correct.  In normal times, I would not do much of what I am being required to do in the job I have been given.  However, these are not normal times.  We need to make rational and good decisions using the cards we have been dealt and not the cards we wish we had, as often portrayed by some of the Deputies opposite.I support Deputy Ó Cuív's analysis of the value of the State sector.  As I said in my opening remarks, the Government supports State investment in jobs.  There is no difficulty in that regard.  Deputy McDonald also spoke of the success of the semi-State agencies and referred to McCarthy's wholesale sell-offs.  There are no wholesale sell-offs.  The only issue agreed in principle by this Government is the sale of a minority shareholding in one State company.  It is invidious to compare this to other decisions such as the Eircom decision, which was to privatise an entire company.  A majority shareholding in Eircom was sold off, as was the case in respect of the decision regarding Aer Lingus.  The Government is determined that the majority of the strategic entity that is the ESB — hopefully on an integrated basis assuming the regulatory issues can be overcome — will be retained in State ownership.Deputy Clare Daly said there will be no economic recovery without jobs, which is what is at the heart of our strategy.  We need to have the wherewithal to create jobs.  We must look around to see what tools are available to us as a State and to marshal those in the interests of job creation and growth.  Deputy Daly used the phrase "your masters" as if to suggest it is only the Government that is under the constraint of the EU-ECB-IMF deal.  We are all under that constraint.  That yoke falls upon the shoulders of every Irish citizen, as bequeathed us by the previous Administration.  We are determined to get out from under that yoke.  We will step by step take the measures required to do that in the timeframe laid out.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's position is not economically feasible, which I believe he knows in his heart.Deputy Pringle spoke of using the ESB to roll out broadband.  None of the measures of which the Deputy spoke is precluded.  The State will continue to hold a majority shareholding in the ESB and will use it to the best economic advantage.  Deputy Healy spoke about the introduction of a wealth tax in place of the sale of a minority shareholding in the ESB.  I would like to see his specific proposals in that regard.  As I have stated previously, I am offering to any Member of the House who has ideas, including on the opposite side, the resources of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to cost them.  I am aware that Sinn Féin has already submitted many questions on this matter and we will, in so far as is possible, try to provide them with a detailed analysis.Deputy Adams spoke about giving up State control and mentioned in particular Bord Gáis.  No decision has been made on Bord Gáis.  The only decision made relates to the sale of a minority shareholding in one State company, namely, the ESB.  The State is not, and will not, give up its control of any strategic State asset.  Deputy Ross spoke about the private sector.  The Deputy is correct that we live in a free market economy.  Some of the rhetoric we have heard is to the contrary.  We live in a free market economy and depend on the free market and private sector to create the bulk of our jobs.  We have a regulated market and significant and vibrant State sector which the Government wants to support.  However, we want to use the resources of the semi-State agencies, as we look at the resources of the State in general, to one purpose now, namely, the economic regeneration of the nation.I hope I have responded to many of the points made.  I regret I missed Deputy Fleming's contribution.  However, we will no doubt have many opportunities in the future to test out all of these matters.  The Government and I are happy to have any decisions made stress tested in committees of the House or in plenary session in this Chamber.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Yesterday, the European Commission published its reform proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy.  These proposals are complex and detailed requiring time to digest them in full.  There are also points of detail on which clarification will be required.  Accordingly, my speech today is my initial reaction.  At this stage, these are proposals only, not final texts.  Negotiations will take place at political and technical level over the next year or more.  It is highly likely the current texts will be significantly altered before final agreement is reached.I already gave the House an outline of the Government's priorities in the CAP reform process in September.  Today, I will present the Government's initial comments on the formal legal proposals and will elaborate on any points raised in this debate during the question-and-answer session.The Commission's texts to hand do not contain too many surprises and there are good points, as well as difficulties in them.  The parallel proposal on the multi-annual financial framework for the next EU budget, presented by the Commission last June, retains the current level of CAP funding at least.  This is a good starting point in the negotiations as it compares favourably with the pressure for severe cuts to the CAP from certain elements of the Commission, as well as a good number of member states, earlier this year.As to the distribution of funds between member states, I am pleased the Commission has adopted the pragmatic approach in respect of direct income supports, one advocated by Ireland for some time.  We strongly advocated this issue should be examined on the basis of each member state's average payment per hectare of eligible area.  I am pleased the Commission has adopted this approach, which Ireland was initially alone in proposing.  The net result, on current figures, is a relatively small reduction in our national ceiling for direct payments from €1.255 billion to €1.236 billion in 2017 and subsequently.  The results would have been very negative for Ireland if another measurement, utilised agricultural area, had been used as the basis of the calculation, as was the Commission's original intention.  We will be subjecting the calculations to detailed scrutiny in the negotiations and will continue to seek to maximise our position.I would have preferred if the Commission had also adopted this approach for the distribution of pillar 1 and pillar 2 funds.  However, the Commission's proposals indicate it will make a separate proposal on rural development — pillar 2 — funding on objective criteria and past performance.  It is clear from the impact analysis that such a proposal could threaten our rural development funding depending on the precise criteria used.  I note, however, the Commission has said there will be a small change in the distribution of rural development national envelopes.I am determined to retain our rural development funding.  This will, to some extent, be facilitated by the fact the Commission has chosen to analyse the distribution of pillar 2 funds on the basis of funding per hectare of pillar 1 eligible area.  Again, this was advocated by Ireland as it demonstrates that our allocation per hectare is below the EU average.  This provides a useful argument to deploy in defence of our rural development funds, as does our good past performance in using these funds.The Commission is proposing the current single payment scheme will be replaced by a new payment model made up of several different elements and moving eventually to a uniform national or regional rate of payment.  The proposals envisage the individual historic reference will be replaced by a model based on regional or national averages.  A target date of 2019 has been set for achieving a uniform value of all basic payment entitlements in a member state or region of a member state.I acknowledge there is little support among other member states for the retention of the historic model as used by Ireland.  In those circumstances, my priority will be to seek as much flexibility as possible for member states to determine the payment models best suited to their conditions and to the development of their farming systems.I will also be seeking appropriate transitional arrangements, as I am not happy with the front-loaded transition process in the Commission's proposals.  When I discussed this issue recently with my French ministerial colleague, Bruno Le Marie, we agreed on the need for such flexibility for member states in both payment models and transition arrangements.  I believe we can get good support at the Council and European Parliament for a reasonable level of flexibility for member states, including a longer and slower transition than envisaged by the Commission.  This will be a major focus of the negotiations over the next two years.My Department has already engaged with stakeholders on this issue and will now intensify consultations on appropriate payment models for Ireland.  We need to examine all possibilities with an open mind to determine what is best to support family farm structures and our ambitions for the sector as set out in Food Harvest 2020.There has been much speculation in the media recently about the use of 2014 as a reference year for the establishment of entitlements.  Under the proposal, new payment entitlements will be allocated in 2014 to active farmers who used at least one payment entitlement in 2011.  The inclusion of this proposal is as a result of lobbying by Ireland and other member states.  Entitlements will be established for the farmer who declares the land in 2014 and will be based on the eligible area declared by the farmer for that year.There is concern the proposals could lead to land market distortions and would not be in the best interests of productive farmers.  I have conveyed these views to the Commission and will continue to press this point.  The proposals already contain some changes from what was in earlier drafts because of Irish pressure.The provisions surrounding establishment of entitlements are complex, requiring a great deal of clarification.  Moreover, it is likely they will be altered significantly during the course of the negotiations.  Against that background, I would strongly urge farmers not to prejudge the situation or rush into decisions which they may later regret.As expected, the Commission has proposed 30% of the national ceiling be set aside for greening, a new payment per hectare payable to farmers for following agricultural practices beneficial to the climate and the environment.  The Government supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  However, I have considerable difficulty with the proposals as they stand.  The existence of a separate greening measure will complicate our existing single payment scheme and hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  I am aware that the CAP already delivers considerable greening.  To avoid excessive bureaucracy, we should consider alternative approaches which achieve the same ends but with less red tape.  I would also take issue with some aspects of the three greening criteria proposed but these can be discussed in more detail later.As a result of Irish lobbying, there has been a positive development in terms of prioritising young farmers.  I welcome the proposal, which mandates member states to use up to 2% of the national ceiling to make top-up payments to young farmers for a five-year period while they are under 40 years of age.  This is a proposal that Ireland was particularly active in pressing with the Commission.  We are all aware that there is a need to improve the age structure of our agricultural work force and to support well educated young farmers who will be the platform for further innovation and growth in the sector.  It is sensible to provide support for young farmers in pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP.I look forward to Deputies' comments and I will try to be as open as I can when answering.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	349	These proposals will form the bedrock of agriculture in the coming years.  In every Dáil debate, Question Time and discussion outside the House, everyone has remarked that agriculture will be one of the main driving forces of economic recovery and will lead to export-led growth.  The industry will play a pivotal role in Ireland's future.  In this context, it is important that we examine yesterday's proposals from Brussels.  Deputy Kirk and I were outside when they were announced.  Judging from the reaction in the European Parliament and many farming organisations, there is a great deal of anxiety about the future.As the Minister rightly stated, the 2014 versus 2011 issue could lead to significant distortions in the land rental market.  It is important the matter be clarified as soon as possible, as it has been highlighted in today's media commentary.  That the language used in the document launched yesterday was far from clear means farmers who are making decisions do not have certainty.  This is an important issue.At a time when there is food scarcity and food security is required, the 7% set-aside will need to be highlighted.  Taking a cross-section of the farmers with whom I spoke yesterday and today, these proposals will affect some people badly due to stacked entitlements.  I refer in particular to cattle farmers.  They built up good entitlements in the 2000-02 reference period before consolidating their holdings and making prudent decisions on the management of their farms.  We are trying to support the high-end beef industry in every way, shape and form, but the farmers in question have significant concerns about the proposals.There has been much discussion about the proposals' contents and there is a great deal of text involved.  It is almost as if the EU is attempting to micro-manage agriculture down to the minutest detail in each member state.  The Department, the Minister, his officials and the Oireachtas must be proactive in getting the best deal for Irish agriculture.  Farmers feel threatened by the proposals.Various documents on the 30% to be set aside for greening were leaked in August and subsequently, but the actual proposals are different.  Irish agriculture must take this issue seriously.  We could set back much of the good work that has been achieved in recent years.  We must ensure the vulnerable ends of the sector that we have been trying to protect through various schemes are not kicked back further by this document.  It will challenge the people who built up substantial entitlements during the previous reference period and consolidated their landholdings.We do not have time to digest every aspect of the proposals.  Having listened to Members of the European Parliament and a broad spectrum of people yesterday, there are concerns.  While it is only a negotiating document, it must be changed radically to ensure it dovetails with what the Irish want from their agriculture industry, given how pivotal the industry's role will be.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I thank Deputy Moynihan for affording me a few minutes to discuss this matter.  It will be one of the more important debates that will be held in the Chamber during the next 18 months.The proposals were circulated by the Commissioner yesterday and the European Parliament has spent some time on them.  The debate will unfold during the next 12 to 18 months.  It is difficult to anticipate whether there will be many changes because agricultural needs within the Community vary considerably from Latvia to Ireland.  The original CAP was framed to identify the needs of the developing industry across the Community, particularly in Ireland.Two points strike me.  In the early days, two common phrases in the terminology that was part and parcel of this area in Brussels were "food security" and "Community preference".  Neither is used in these proposals.  There has been phenomenal growth in the world's population.  Food production in Europe will need to increase to certain levels to meet these needs.  If developing countries have the capacity to import food produced in Ireland, the UK, France, Germany or elsewhere in the EU, we must have an industry that is geared towards meeting the needs of developing markets in Asia, India and so on.The Minister referred to a key point, that of the age profile in Irish agriculture.  The number of people under 35 years of age who are actively involved in farming is low.  If we are to get the dynamism, innovation and changes that we need, we must attract young people to the industry.  I welcome the proposals in the document to try to address this issue.What about the interim?  The Minister and the Minister for Social Protection are members of the Government that took the decision to raid pension funds to create employment.  This objective is commendable in its own way, but some of that money could have been spent on the economy's primary production sectors wherein national wealth is created.  The agriculture industry generates beef, dairy and other exports.  Should we not take the opportunity to create jobs in the industry?  At a time when nearly 500,000 people are unemployed, agriculture is seen in a different light today than it was two or three years ago.  Young people are being drawn towards it.  The demand for places in agricultural colleges around the country bears this fact out.  There are not enough places.  Some colleges are overcrowded with students.  There are too many students in them and given the need for mentoring and tuition, having too many in a class creates its own problems.  It may well be an area the Minister needs to examine.  The Warrenstowns of the world are closed and no longer available.Next March, many farmers in the country will face a problem with a superlevy.  We have had exchanges in the Chamber about this and it will cause huge problems.  Young farmers and farmers who are not so young are way over their quota production allowance now and to get to next March will be a job for them.  There is a need for clarity on this.  Various suggestions are being tossed around and debated and on the previous occasion the Minister indicated the possibility of the butterfat adjustment holding out some prospect.  Yesterday, I spoke to a number of people in Brussels and the indications were that prospects exist in this regard but major voices in Europe may not be in favour of it.  The need for a diplomatic offensive on this is obvious.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I apologise to the Minister as I missed the beginning of his address.  It is one of those days.I described the rumoured proposals which emanated on CAP reform as "steady as she goes" rather than ambitious or challenging and this has been confirmed.  After months of speculation and leaked documents, I welcome the fact the Commission has produced a set of formal legislative proposals for the reform of the CAP.  It will provide a firm basis for debate and negotiation.  Very extensive documentation exists and we will need time to study, analyse and debate it and for the Government to negotiate it.  It is already clear that a few key areas require greater analysis and discussion.  These are the size of the CAP budget, the distribution among the member states, the distribution within member states, the future basis for payments to farmers, the greening of pillar 1 and regional flexibility and simplification.As I make my comments I am conscious I have two responsibilities.  I will seek to protect and promote the livelihoods and interests of mainly small farmers in designated disadvantaged areas in the west, the north west and the Border counties.  I also recognise the national agri-food plan, Food Harvest 2020, will be significantly impacted for better or worse by how well or badly the draft proposals are finally agreed and implemented.I would like to have seen a larger CAP budget.  The EU speaks about the absolute need for food security but does not translate this into tangible outputs.  Recently, I stated at a meeting I would like to see an EU equivalent of Food Harvest 2020 whereby the EU sets out a food security strategy for the next decade.  However, we do not appear to have this.  The Minister and the Department must fight very hard to prevent any reductions in the CAP budget and to ensure a significant increase in the rural development budget allocation because we should have good grounds for improvement on this.With regard to the distribution of payments to farmers, there appears to be a growing realisation that there will be a move away from historically-based payments towards a flat rate regime at regional level.  However, we must ensure changes made do not damage either farmers or the targets we have set out in Food Harvest 2020.  At a minimum, we should seek a smooth and gradual transition over a period of years, because these proposals have the potential to introduce a significant step change in the first years of the new regime.The base year of the proposal is 2014 but this is counterbalanced by the requirement to have a payment in 2011.  This leaves the door open for grant aid by size of cheque-book and we simply cannot accept this.  We must also consider carefully the definition of "working farmers" and we must ensure it deals with small farmers in the west, north-west and Border counties whose holdings are not large enough to employ somebody.  While the employment initiative in the proposals is welcome it would be wrong to penalise farmers whose holdings are too small to permit them to employ somebody.  I hope we do not see one good measure being paid for by introducing bad measures for farmers who cannot economically afford to employ workers.I am extremely disappointed the quota for dairy milk has not been lifted and that farmers in Ireland still face a superlevy.  We have the ridiculous situation whereby creameries in the Twenty-six Counties cannot buy milk from farmers in the Twenty-six Counties who have milk available, but have to purchase in the Six Counties while people in the Six Counties cannot purchase from the Twenty-six Counties.  It is a ludicrous situation.  There is no need for the quota.  It is accepted that it is obsolete and should have been lifted.  We must return to negotiating this.I have serious concerns about the proposals for greening pillar 1 because they may have a negative impact on the competitiveness of our agricultural industry.  They also have the potential, despite what is stated about simplifying and streamlining, to increase bureaucracy and the administrative burden on farmers.  I am also concerned about how tangible the benefits of these measures will be.  We need much discussion and debate on these areas.The Commission has brought forward proposals to confine support to active farmers and I welcome this.  For some time I have called for this and most people will have sympathy with this objective.  The reason for the existence of the CAP should be to support farmers.  We need an effective and workable definition of what is an "active farmer" in the context of a decoupled support regime.  I have doubts that the proposed test, which is based on CAP receipts and other income, will be effective and workable.  We do not want to fall into an administrative quagmire or to distort or disrupt the conacre market and the availability of land to farm businesses.I am reasonably heartened by the proposals on regional flexibility because member states should have the flexibility to tailor their environment and industries to their requirements.  However, it must be strongly negotiated and we should end up with something workable which ensures the maximum possible degree of national flexibility.With regard to rural development, I very much welcome the Commission's increased focus on improving competitiveness in the food chain and on promoting investment in research and development.  We should be in pole position on this but there is probably much preparatory work to be done.  Given the size of the industry, the people employed in it and our previous experience in research and development we should put together a very tight package of proposals on this.We should be the first to bring those proposals to the EU.What can one say about simplification?  The proposal is for the regulations to be simplified and for less bureaucracy.  However, the detail of the content seems to indicate otherwise and this will require further examination to ensure farmers will not have to deal with another layer of bureaucracy.The proposals are just that and they have to be agreed.  There needs to be widespread public discussion with the key stakeholders and we all need to be informed before the specific case for Ireland is argued with the Commission.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I commend the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for his efforts in endeavouring to secure for Ireland the best possible deal in the ongoing CAP negotiations and in particular for the manner in which he challenged the EU bid to use 2014 as a reference year for future payments.  I believe this has now been rectified and I ask the Minister to clarify whether 2011 will be the reference year for future single farm payments.  This will enable active farmers to rent the land and to develop their production rates.  It is heartening to see that the majority of the money will go directly to the farmer thus ensuring that 128,000 land holdings in the country will remain viable.  Approximately 300,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in agriculture and this number will be maintained and expanded over the next number of years.I am pleased a system of equality of payments is being introduced so farmers in the poorer land which is prevalent on the western seaboard will be on a par with their counterparts in the eastern part of the country.  Additional moneys and incentives will be provided for farmers in areas with high rainfall.  I ask the Minister to clarify the criteria for these incentives.  Those of us who live in County Kerry are very aware of the adverse effects.  I refer to an interview on Radio Kerry a few years ago when the presenter asked a farmer what type of farming he did.  The farmer replied he was milking ten cows on 50 acres; ten acres for milking the cows and 40 acres of water.  The presenter was confused and he asked him to elaborate and the farmer said he had ten acres arable and 40 acres horrible.  This is the case for several people engaged in farming in the west and south west.  I am pleased to note the Minister will maintain his stance on equalisation in order to put these people on a solid footing.  They have been custodians of the land and of the farms all down the years and in very tough times.  It is crucial that we keep them on the family farm.It is appropriate that young farmers are being incentivised to take up farming as only 7% of farmers are in the younger age bracket, under 35 years, of the 128,000 engaged in farming, meaning a total of 14,000.  I am pleased to note that the agricultural colleges are full and there is a demand for places.  This demonstrates that young farmers foresee a future for themselves on the land.  I am confident they will maximise our full potential and growth levels so we will be a prime producer of agricultural products and world leaders in the field.I ask the Minister to clarify what will be the situation regarding land that is not farmed and has not been entered into the area aid scheme for this year or before 2011.  What will happen this land and will the entry of this land dilute the national allocations or any late applications for this year?
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I thank the Acting Chairman for her comments when she spoke on these proposals.  As many other Deputies said, there is a lot in them and it will take time to digest them.  On a first reading it seems a farmer's life is becoming fairly complicated in comparison to what it used to be.  There is some confusion among farmers as to what has happened since we joined the EEC as it was then.  If the Minister will excuse me using this analogy, it seems to be a case of "Simon Says".  In the 1970s, farmers were told to take out ditches and use as much land as possible and now they will be fined for doing the same thing but the proposal is for them to go back in that direction.  It is a little baffling at times as to what is EU policy and whether there will be a new policy in ten years time to take the ditches out again.I refer to the IFA and the ICMSA responses to the proposals which show they have serious concerns that farm incomes could be hit by up to 50%.  So far as I can understand it the aim of the EU is to guarantee food security but if this is its aim then it would want to consider increasing the funding.  I refer to the cuts in the suckler premium scheme and the AOS scheme over the past few years which show there are many challenges for farmers.  Even if the Minister does the best job possible, the challenges will remain.On the positive side, we live in a very fertile country and some of these proposals could be beneficial.  I refer in particular to capping.  Many people would not agree with this proposal and some farm organisations do not seem to agree but in my view it is ludicrous that some big farmers and people who are not even farmers are availing of hundreds of thousands of euro in subsidies per year.  If there is a limited global figure it would make far more sense to direct more of this money towards small farmers.  I note that under this mechanism the funds may be saved to remain in the member state concerned and may be transferred into a rural development envelope for use in innovation and investment by farmers.  This makes a lot of sense and where possible it is preferable to exporting the raw ingredient.  For instance, France does not export its grapes and subsequently buy the champagne or fine wine produced from them in another country.  France achieves maximum value from what is an excellent product.  We have excellent raw material here and much more could be done to make added-value products.I refer to the potential for rural development projects.  The proposal includes start-up grants of up to €70,000 and business start-up aid of €15,000 per small farm.  This has to be a good thing.  It is hoped it can be used in such a way to mean that local produce will be on sale in the streets of every small town in the country.  Farmers have only one route to market and the multiples make massive profits with very little margin for the farmer.  An investment in young farmers and small farmers could mean they could process their produce on site which would add significant value and profit.  A farmer could develop processing on site, adding value, sell locally and keep much of the profit other companies would get.  This would not alone boost local farm income, but also increase the attractiveness of areas for tourists and would return some of the originality that has been stripped from Irish towns to them.When we joined the EEC, my mother used to ask me what had happened to farmers, because she saw them buying potatoes, cabbages and all the things they could grow themselves.  There are downsides to these proposals and when I look at them in more detail, I will be able to explain my thoughts on them.  What sticks out as a positive is that there is increased potential for young people to get involved in farming and for small farmers to be part of a thriving industry.  There is no reason that should not be the case in my town.  The majority of our fruit and vegetables are brought in from outside the area and while we produce a significant amount of meat, much of our meat is brought in from outside areas.  There is more to be said on these proposals and when I have looked further into them, I will give my opinion.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The stated objective of the run-in to the CAP was to provide for a mechanism to ensure we could produce as much food as possible within the European Community, do it sustainably and support viable rural communities.  To that end, it succeeded within the Commission debate in keeping the fund, by and large, as it is.  From Ireland's point of view, thanks to being able to persuade people to use eligible areas as opposed to used agricultural land areas, we have more or less secured what will amount to a very small drop in our envelope.We must remember that the Commission's motivation is to see the three objectives being attained and it is quite clear that one of the key aims is to see a convergence — probably much quicker than we would like — of the single farm payment.  The greening measure, particularly at the proposed percentage, effectively puts 30% of the fund into the flattening of the rate straight away.  What we must ensure, if we are to have some convergence, is that we do this as slowly as possible.  If we are to ensure that we can produce as much food as possible within the European Union, the last thing we should do is create volatility.  For some people, the panacea is that everybody gets the same rate.  This is seen as the primary tool for upping the wealth of people who receive less currently and it is also thought it will increase production.  Both are a fallacy.There are ten stated objectives in this, one of which is competitiveness.  If we agree tomorrow to give the member states on far smaller single farm payments than us the same payment as us, what will happen is they will lose competitiveness.  Their disposable income and standard of living would not increase, because those with money and cheque-books would come in and buy up the land and rights.  The result would be consolidation, with small farms being bought up and people exiting farming at a rapid rate.Our job now is to unite behind our negotiators and our Ministers and persuade people of this reality.  Many issues will be raised here, such as reference years, and whether 2011 is an adequate trigger mechanism to ensure we do not have speculation, particularly in the conacre sector, where we could have people who will farm "on paper" and hope they make a killing and hold the young active farmers we are trying to promote to ransom come 2014 and 2015.  The greening measures are tailor made for us, particularly when, as Mr. Kiely said yesterday, we have a food security issue on the one hand and climate change issues on the other.  Part of our selling of ourselves to ensure we are allowed to up our production game and not be part of a regime that will stymie that is that we can deal with both.  We can produce food and do it in a way that is most beneficial to climate change mitigation.We have a lot of work to do.  I cannot disagree with some of the stated objectives, such as that research and innovation will be improved.  All farmers, young and old, will welcome that.  This is a positive aspect and is a result of the arguments put forward by Irish representatives and our previous and current Government.  Nobody could argue with simplification or with the provision to look after people in fragile, designated or less-favoured areas.  These provisions are all a recognition of the stated objective of creating viable rural communities.  However, let us not fool ourselves.  There is a long way to go.  We need to build up alliances with other nations and to persuade people that the simple flattening of the rate, here and across member states, will not improve the lot of people who think it will.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I welcome the release of the reform proposals yesterday.  It is good to see the legal proposals finally on the table.  There has been much speculation and anticipation over the past 12 months and people are glad to see the shadow-boxing over and know the real negotiations will now take place.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Coveney, well.  We have great faith in our fellow Cork colleague and as a former farmer, he is due great credit for how he has handled his Ministry to date.We have 16 months or so of long, tough negotiation ahead.  One issue we should touch on is that our changed position within Europe should confer on us a greater negotiation position.  I would not like to have seen any Minister go to conduct these negotiations 12 months ago.  I am going to Brussels on Monday to speak to a group of parliamentarians from the 27 member states on how Ireland as a country has been the shining example of how to manage its way out of the EU-IMF programme.  This demonstrates that, once again, Irish Ministers are going to Europe with the respect of our European colleagues.  We must emphasise the grave importance for our nation that agriculture and food production remain key parts of our economy.  That message should have a favourable ear.It is vital that we protect our budget allocation and I welcome the fact that the current proposals will only see a 1.5% reduction in that.  This is good news, but this must be maintained through the negotiations.  I support Deputy Doyle on the importance of the flexibility we will have in the future.  However, I have some concerns.  I am concerned by the idea of a flat-based payment.  Ireland should oppose this because the most productive farmers would lose out to those who are less efficient, which would be unwelcome.  I have spoken of another concern previously.  When I was studying economics in UCC in the 1990s, one of the units on my course was agricultural economics.  A concept that has stuck with me since then is the issue of food security within Europe and I remember my lecturer suggesting that this would be a major issue for Europeans within the lifetime of the students in that class.  Here we are, with the EU not coming to terms with the issue for all European citizens.  As a Continent and as a people, we must address this issue.Ireland is perhaps one of the best placed nations to look towards allowing a Continent that has focused on energy security and military security to consider its most fundamental and basic need, the ability to feed its own people.  I urge the Minister to allow for the potential to rebuild relationships with countries such as France.  Our relationship with France has been terse in recent times but I believe France shares many of our ambitions in this regard.We all welcome the positive measures for young farmers.  Young people across all walks of life are the future and the age profile of farmers is something we must correct.  Farming is a wonderful career with an optimistic future if we can secure a good deal over the next few years.  The proposals to support young farmers have been driven by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney, and are welcome.There is a requirement to wrap the green flag around ourselves in respect of these negotiations.  The Opposition Members who spoke were productive in their comments.  The Fine Gael committee met for seven hours over the past number of days and has done great work under the chairmanship of Deputy Martin Heydon.  The interest of the party and that of our colleagues in Government, the Labour Party, is to secure the best possible deal.  It is important that representative bodies continue to be as productive as they have been and that we work together to secure a deal in the best interests of our country and our farming and food production sector.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I propose to share time with Deputy Michael Kitt.Over the past 24 hours, since the announcement of the package, the Wexford farmers have been on the telephones outlining their opposition to the document before us.  They believe it will knock the heart out of productive farming and create uncertainty in farmers over the next two years.  This is at a time when farming is getting up off its knees after a number of difficult years and making a valuable contribution to the economy.The wheels of Europe move slowly and I ask the Minister to explain why it will take until 2014 to finalise the proposals.  Productive farmers want to produce and develop and they see great opportunities in the Food Harvest 2020 document that the Minister has embraced.  They see it as a way forward for farming.  The document before us will hinder productive farming in this country and this is a major concern to farmers.The creation of a new flat rate payment system is one of the major concerns.  This is one of the first major changes since the MacSharry reforms of 1992.  The year 2014 will be used as a reference year and the impact of this is still not clear.  The Minister must have further dialogue and negotiation over the coming months.  The fact that 800,000 ha of land, 20% of the total, is rented directly will have an impact on over 40,000 farmers and this leaves Ireland particularly vulnerable.  Their interests must be protected in redefining the reference year through future negotiations.What will happen to farmers who are not active this year but become active by 2014?  All sides of the House referred to young farmers and, given the employment levels across the country and the lack of employment opportunities, it is important to encourage as many farmers as possible to go back to farming and see opportunities there.  Perhaps the Minister can explain what happens if a person goes back to active farming before 2014.In my county and in IFA circles, the major concern is that the flat rate payment will hinder active farmers.  I have always been in favour of support for small farmers but we must also have productive farmers who create products for the processors in the interests of job creation.  This area is of major concern.  We must have a payment scheme that benefits active farmers, thus ensuring good security and the achievement of the Food Harvest 2020 targets set for production in this country.  It is important that this is one of the areas the Minister deals with.We already know that Irish farmers are producing with a green ethos.  Farmers have full environmental obligations, which some would say are overly stringent, but they are producing their product in an environmentally friendly way.  Reference to approximately 30% greening is of major concern to farmers.  In light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, which places Ireland on an environmentally sustainable agricultural path, there is no need for additional mandatory greening actions.The Minister will have a fight on his hands and the farmers want him to take off his gloves to fight the battle.  It will be a collective decision from all sides of the House to support the Minister.  It is important that the role of the productive farmer is enhanced, incentivised and protected in any negotiations between now and 2013.  Farmers who want to produce between now and 2013 tell me there is great uncertainty in this document.  Can we allay their fears in some shape or form sooner than that so that they can continue to produce and continue to be at the heart of productive farming in this country?  It is important for the Minister to take off the gloves and fight the cause on behalf of Irish farming.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I welcome the opportunity to debate the CAP reform proposals.  I welcome what the Minister said in his address.  I agree it is necessary to develop a more competitive and sustainable agriculture sector.I was interested in the Minister's point about progressive capping.  He said it may not have much impact in Ireland but it is the right direction to go.  For over 30 years, I have attended public meetings and I often hear that so much of the budget goes to so few farmers.  The idea of capping is interesting and the Minister will follow up on this.At the other end of the scale are the small farmers.  Many of the requests I receive concern minimum payments.  I do not refer to €500 or €1,000 small-scale payments but something more realistic.  This is something the Minister should examine when he considers capping and helping smaller farmers.There is an emphasis on a fair return for farmers.  Farmers want to produce and the idea of setting aside 7% of land for ecological purposes is neither feasible, practical or welcome.  The idea that payments were tied to production is always more positive.  We have had these schemes already, such as REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the disadvantaged area payments.  These were of great benefit to smaller producers and I appeal to the Minister to get the grants paid as quickly as possible.  If the Department of Social Protection can pay out so much money to its clients every week, we should be able to get these payments out.  We saw that frustration boiled over in Wexford because of the delays.Sorting out land parcels for the AEOS scheme, which is particularly a problem in the west of Ireland, is important.I would like to see a particular emphasis on the sheep industry.  My own county of Galway is famous for its sheep but there is a problem with support for the sheep industry and the wool industry, which is becoming more important.  Deputy Brendan Smith, when he was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, did find €8 million in grants for sheep fencing and mobile equipment, which was an important incentive for the sheep industry.With regard to the proposals on greening, someone said in the past few days that we have green tape as well as red tape.  I am disappointed we have not received more information on this.  With the REP and AEO schemes there is already great regard for the environment among farmers.  If I might make one criticism, I do not agree that there should be a specific type of fencing, which would take up much of the grant money on that scheme.I welcome the help and assistance for young farmers, including the top-up payments that were mentioned.  This should ensure the future of agricultural colleges throughout the country, which is positive news.  I have said to the Minister before that my local agricultural college in Mountbellew has so many applications it cannot take in all of the students on its courses.  That is a positive thing in one way, but it shows there is a need for more teachers and more places in the agricultural colleges.The Minister has talked about the case he is making with regard to the reference year for entitlements.  I welcome his statement that farmers who had one payment entitlement in 2011 would be encompassed in this proposal.  However, it is still of major concern.  We hear reports about the dangers of land-grabbing and all of the various behind the scenes efforts that might be made to distort the situation, which is worrying.  I wish the Minister well.  He has a big battle ahead but he will have our support.  We must be careful to ensure the continued livelihood of farmers, particularly smaller farmers, in this country.

Before I discuss yesterday's announcement, I would like to echo the point with which Deputy Kirk finished up his comments earlier about the superlevy.  It is not particularly related to the general discussion we are having, but I appeal to the Minister to act in that regard as soon as possible.  There are a number of dairy farmers who will face acute difficulties in the next few months if action is not taken in the immediate term.I would like to make a couple of points about the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy as announced yesterday by the Commission, without repeating everything that has been said by previous speakers.  It is good that the first phase of the shadow-boxing, at least, is over and that the Minister and his officials will be engaging in detailed negotiation, over the next year or more, about what form the review will take.  There are a couple of things I would like to point out which are of particular interest to me and to people who are involved in agriculture in my constituency.  I commend the Minister on his argument for reserving 2% of the funding for young farmers, which was something in which he took a personal interest.  Since the removal of installation aid and the changes made with regard to the pension scheme for early retirement for farmers, any significant step to encourage the transfer of land to younger farmers and encourage their activity in agriculture is to be welcomed, and I commend the Minister in that regard.Like most of the previous speakers, I am not a fan of the proposal for flat-rate payments.  I agree with Deputy John Browne that we must focus on those who are productive in agriculture.  Part of the basis of the new system of CAP, with decoupled payments, was the aim of moving funding towards not just those who were productive, but those who were producing a product that was wanted by the market.  There is a danger, with the move to a flat-rate payment system, that this may not necessarily be the case in the future.On the issue of caps, I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy Kitt, with regard to the maximum cap.  In fact, the proposed maximum cap might be a bit generous, to be honest.  This is something that, along with everything else, will be up for negotiation.  I support the idea of a minimum payment, but it will need to be based on the productivity of individual farmers.  It will not be easy to come up with a solution that is equitable.Like previous speakers, I feel the proposal to link 30% of payments to environmental measures is a bit excessive.  The proposals as announced yesterday, including a 5% limit on conversion from permanent pasture to arable crops, are a bit too rigid and will present a particular difficulty in this country, as will the 7% that is to be set aside for ecological purposes.  I know the Minister has particular views in this regard and I ask him to expound on them at the end of the discussion.  I wish him and his officials well in their continued negotiations at European level.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I am glad to speak on these proposals, which are close to my heart.  It was good to see the legal proposals on CAP that were published yesterday.  Significantly, Ireland will retain its EU allocation almost completely.  The EU is committed to maintaining CAP spending at 2013 levels into the future.  One small thing that is worth noting is the doubling of funding for research and innovation in food security, the bioeconomy and sustainable agriculture.  The proposed level of spending here is €5 billion, which is important, because research and development are key in achieving more productivity from the land we have.The legal proposal also recognises a number of challenges, and high on the list is food security.  This is something that has been spoken about a lot, but I do not think people realise what it really means.  Food security is something one only misses when one does not have it.  We have had cheap oil, cheap money and cheap food, but oil is no longer cheap and neither is money, and food will not always be cheap.  However, if we have a progressive attitude and make sure our lands are as productive as possible, we will keep it affordable.I also welcome the news that sugar quotas are to go in 2015.  This is something for which I have fought for a long time, as has the Minister, who has been there from the start.  The EU recognises that changes need to be made.  Sugar has become scarce and expensive and obviously it is prepared to consider the issue again.  I have spoken to the Minister, who has presented a clear plan and is very supportive.  I welcome the allocation of 2% of the direct payment envelope to young farmer schemes.  Such payments helped me when I went into farming.  There must always be new generations of young people entering farming.As a commercial tillage farmer, I recognise the possibility of a reduced single farm payment cheque.  We are fortunate that the Minister understands this and will seek flexibility, so that whatever the level of reduction, it will not be too harsh or too quick.  Ireland is expected to retain its share of pillar 2 funding.  While the proposals are out there, there is much talking to be done before we achieve a final settlement.  An inclusive approach is needed to bring everybody together.  I compliment the IFA on its engagement with the process and I look forward to future developments.

I also welcome the Minister's comments to me at Tuesday's meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture regarding his strong identification and attachment to small rural farmers and the disadvantaged payment issue.  The Minister has indicated his commitment to examine how we can secure maximum effect and benefit for rural economies.  Given the scarcity of available resources, we must ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the resources we have to rural areas.I also welcome the Minister's stated priorities with regard to Ireland's strategy for approaching CAP reform.  He will have the full support of the Labour Party in seeking to maximise resources for the CAP as far as possible, so that this country has a sustainable food production strategy in the interest of the broader economy.  We will support him as he seeks to secure flexibility from other member states in regard to the type of payment model he outlined at Tuesday's meeting.  We are all agreed on the need to ensure that single farm payment funds are protected and that any future adjustments are fair and equitable.I noted the Minister's clarification earlier this week on an issue I raised with him, namely, the necessity to ensure that whatever emerges from the reforms, we must have a simple and effective way of minimising unnecessary bureaucracy.  Farmers are currently faced with a minefield of compliance paperwork.  I support the Minister's position in regard to the incident in Wexford this week where direct action took place against the Minister and his officials.  We were led to believe this was the consequence of a failure to communicate certain issues.  It has been brought to my attention that compliance in regard to paperwork is a major issue for the Department.  This is an area urgently in need of reform in order to ensure the Department reaches its targets under the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's interdepartmental spending review.  One can only assume the Department is allocating significant resources for the purpose of correcting documentation, reviewing digitised maps and so on.  We must tackle this inefficiency within the Department in order to ensure prompt, efficient and secure payment for rural communities.I had a great deal more to say but the Acting Chairman has indicated my time is up.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The proposals contained in the CAP document published yesterday in Brussels, if accepted and implemented in full, will be hugely damaging to the agricultural sector in Ireland.  They will damage the viability of family farms and undermine the potential within the agricultural and farming community.  As such, I welcome the Minister's commitment that he will seek to ensure that no changes to the CAP budget or structures will impair the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 report.  I assure the Minister, on behalf of Sinn Féin, that we will fully support him in his efforts to ensure CAP benefits to Irish farmers are retained.The Minister must also ensure that any changes do not introduce further delays and red tape which would impede farmers in drawing down their entitlements.  That type of bureaucracy has been one of the most common causes for complaint from farmers in recent years, although it would seem the delays are often due to hold-ups within the Department rather than in Brussels.  I am interested in the Minister's reference to his proposal that individual members states should be allowed to shape their own payment models.  Will he clarify whether this implies a different method of payment in regard to the regularity of cheques or a more radical change in the administration of the single farm payment?My party has made several proposals regarding the overall structure of the single farm payment scheme in terms of modulation, which effectively amounts to a gradual decrease in payments, and in regard to a limit on the amount of money that can be received by any one recipient.  In many cases the largest payments go to agribusinesses rather than actual farmers.  The maintenance of active farming as a means of production is of great importance to our food security as well as to the broader economy.There is a great disparity in how the single farm payment is distributed.  In a report I produced some years ago for the former Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food, I pointed out that 68% of farmers were receiving less than €10,000 under the scheme, which accounted for 28% of the total payments made.  On average, the bottom 68% received a payment of €4,057 compared with an average of €22,170 for the top 32% of recipients.  The disparity in payments was even starker when one took into account that 55,312 farmers, representing more than 44% of all recipients, received less than €5,000, accounting for just 10.5% of the total.  By contrast, the 2,092,or 1.7%, of farmers who received more than €50,000 accounted for €154 million, an average payment of €73,500 and 12.6% of the total fund.  The largest single payment was of more than €500,000.While it can be argued that this disparity merely reflects the differences in farm scale and production, it also indicates that many farmers are at risk of being forced out of farming.  That undermines the whole basis of the CAP, which is to protect the European model of farming based on family farms.  The proposals being put forward will wipe out a huge section of the rural population, impacting in particular on small family farmers who are struggling to survive in current circumstances.  As I said, the Minister will have the full support of my party in seeking to protect these farmers.  I come from a small family farm background myself and am conscious of the contribution the family farm has made to our communities, society and economy.  Its survival into the future in a viable way is of great importance from a social, economic and community perspective.  I am a strong supporter of positive discrimination towards smaller, weaker farmers in order to ensure their survival and continued viability.  We must all put our shoulder to the wheel in an effort to secure the future prosperity of the sector.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The proposals published yesterday are of serious concern for farmers.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's assurances today in regard to his objectives.  I hope his key priority will be to ensure the Food Harvest 2020 targets are achieved.  Farming is a major enterprise in this country and a huge driver of the economy.  Some 60% of Irish manufactured exports were derived from agriculture with a value of approximately €8 billion in 2010.  The objective in Food Harvest 2020 is to increase that figure to approximately €12 billion by 2020.  That is a huge driver of our economy and in terms of retention of jobs and job creation.  The sector supports approximately 300,000 jobs and we want to see an increase in that number to ensure that this sector, which is key to the economy's recovery, prospers further.It is important to remember that even though the sector has increased considerably in recent years, farm incomes remain particularly low.  The 2010 figure is in the region of €18,000 which is half the average industrial wage.  This year there was an 11% increase in farm assist payments to farmers.  While farming has improved in the past two years, farm families continue to experience serious difficulties in terms of income derived from farming.Another area I hope the Minister will give priority to is the age profile of the farming community.  Approximately 25% of farmers are over 65 years of age and only about 7% are under 35.  That is the current position and it appears to be endemic in farming.  We must seriously consider how that can be changed because if farming is to prosper and contribute to the economy, and to the local economy, we have to have young people seriously involved in farming.  The current position has pertained for a number of years but it is an area we must focus on and if tax changes need to be made to ensure that farms are transferred at an earlier age to younger people that should be examined.Farming has contributed a great deal to job creation with 300,000 people currently depending on farming.  With the expansion of the world population there is a huge opportunity to create further jobs both directly in farming and in downstream employment.  I hope the Minister will prioritise that area.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I commend the Minister for his commitment to the agricultural sector which is clear to all, particularly those of us who sit on the agriculture committee.  I commend him also for having recently extended the deadline for spreading slurry until the end of the month to enable people take advantage of this bout of good weather.With regard to areas with natural constraints, I understand that one of the proposals in the CAP reform proposals is a top-up scheme proposed for least favoured areas under pillar I that would initially run alongside the existing disadvantaged areas scheme.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I understand the proposal is that the disadvantaged areas scheme would cease at some point during the period of reform considered.  As a representative of Clare, where a number of farmers farm under severe natural constraints in some cases, I am concerned that their top-up measures for disadvantaged areas be continued.  I would like to know the Minister's response to this reform proposal and if it is optional, which I understand is the case from media reports, if the Department or the Minister would be minded to introduce it in Ireland.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The first observation, which I should have made earlier in my contribution, is that this is a classic case of the devil being in the detail.  The teasing out of the detail of these proposals will be vitally important and before final judgment is passed on the document we will need to get some of that detail.  There has been much speculation in the media recently about the use of 2014 as a reference year for the establishment of entitlements.  Under the proposal, new payment entitlements will be allocated in 2014 to active farmers who used at least one payment entitlement in 2011.In terms of the reference year, the 2014 versus 2011 argument is fundamental and while I know the original proposal was 2014, the year 2011 was referred to in that unless the claims or payments were made in that year applications will not be considered.  It is clear this aspect requires clarity because the rental and leased land will be hugely problematic for farmers who depend on it to expand and keep their operations going.On the definition of an active farmer, we had definitions in previous CAP packages but will there be any change in the definition having regard to the fact that we are into an area based payments system?  On the greening measures, what is the position regarding a dairy farmer or a beef farmer who re-seeds his land on a fairly regular basis?  It is clear there will be a period of time in which the land will not be available for grazing because of the re-seeding process.On crop rotation, people in tillage who grow cereals rotate with potato growers and in many instances lease land to major potato growers, which I am sure happens in the Minister of State's constituency on a regular basis.  It suits individual farmers who have a tillage business to rotate with potato growers.  How will that work out?  Will it affect the area based payment arrangement?Also on the greening measures, if individual farmers happen to have suitable sites for wind turbines does the Minister envisage any way that payment or grant aid can be given to those farmers where it is expedient and wise to provide a wind turbine to reduce the cost of electricity and help reduce the carbon footprint in the process?  Also, regarding solar panelling on dairy farms and the milking parlour where it will be possible to install solar panels, does the Minister envisage any aid being available under those headings?While we are not concerned in this debate with the single farm payment, the digitisation and the delay in payments, it must be possible to make the payments——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	372	There is no delay in single farm payments at all.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I refer to the individual farmer where the farm visit has taken place but the report has come back stating that the farm has to be redigitised.  Clearly, there will be a delay in payments in that regard.  It is affecting cash flow of individual farmers at a time when it does not suit them.In the context of the developing agricultural industry, I am aware there are forces at play in the agriculture world who believe there is potential to regenerate the sugar beet industry but there is a need for the Minister and the Department to give some direction to the agricultural industry as a whole because it is relevant in the context of crops and the plans people will have for the future.The new area based payment and the question of where commonages fit in is relevant in my own constituency of Louth.  In a previous incarnation I tried to address difficulties for individual shareholders and commonages.  How will that fit into the framework for area based payments?Regarding horse training farms, such as large farms used for the training of race horses that clearly are not in the mainstream activity of farm production, how will they be treated in the context of the area based payment?  On the afforested areas, I ask the Minister to comment on the 7% eco-provision in the plans.  Is this set-aside by a different name?  Is it realistic to leave this aspect as part of what is termed the "end of the day product" and which will be part of the CAP policy going forward?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Our understanding is that the Commission is trying to give countries an option to use up to 5% of the single farm payment envelope to target payments at areas of natural constraint.  It has suggested, as an example, less favoured areas, LFAs, but it is not necessarily confined to those areas alone.  We potentially may have the capacity to make exceptional payments because of natural constraints, for example, because of designation, or the limitations that apply to areas of environmental or biodiversity significance of certain regions.  That is in addition to LFAs remaining under Pillar 2 funding.  There will be a requirement to have a definition of LFA lands to qualify.  We have worked hard to get an understanding in the Commission as to how to maximise the land that would qualify under the LFA definition.  We define less favoured areas by a measurement of the moisture in land; in other words, most LFAs and disadvantaged areas are disadvantaged because of the amount of water that is held in the earth.  They are boggy areas and areas without good drainage.  We have got acceptance in the Commission for a way of measuring LFAs on the basis of moisture retention in land, which is a major success from our point of view.  Otherwise, we would have stood to lose massive tracts of land that are currently regarded as less favoured areas.  We may still lose some, but we have a mechanism to make an argument for LFAs into the future.  There are two mechanisms for funding LFAs, the first of which is the current system under Pillar 2, which will change in terms of its criteria, and the second is that we can, if we want, set aside some single farm payment moneys to make extra payments to certain designated lands that are disadvantaged or have certain conditions applying to them that justify an extra payment.  There are more options open to us there.I want to clarify the position in respect of the 2014 versus the 2011 reference year.  Everyone has mentioned this issue.  To be clear to Deputy Fleming who commented earlier, and I thank him for his comments, 2014 still remains the reference year.  We are not that happy about that but it is the reference year in the document.  What has changed from previously leaked documents or our understanding of what is likely to come up in documents is that the EC has now added a requirement to have eligibility for a payment of some sort under the single farm payment scheme in 2011.  The European Commission is trying to prevent people who want to invest heavily between now and 2014 in order to build up single farm payment eligibility but who are not currently farmers, in other words, to prevent significant land speculation coming from outside the agricultural sector.  There has been a good deal of concern about that in recent weeks.  The Commission has solved a part of the problem but there are still concerns about 2014 as the basis for a reference year, even with the 2011 eligibility requirement.  That is the reason I am saying to farmers not to rush out and start making decisions on the basis of the current proposals on the reference year issue because that element of these proposals is likely to change and be amended in the next year or so.  It could be earlier than that, and I hope we get the clarity Deputies are requesting so that we do not impact unnecessarily on the leasing market.In relation to the crop rotation and crop diversity requirements under greening, I honestly do not think what is being proposed at present makes any sense.  The idea that one would be required to have a minimum of 5% of arable land, planted with three different crops is a bit of a nonsense.  I think what the Commission would have liked to do is put in place a measure that required farmers to have crop rotation plans on arable farms, but it was proving very difficult to write a policy that would be easily enforceable.  What we have is a measure that will be questioned, amended and changed under the greening measures.I am in the hands of the Chair.  I can respond to Deputy Kirk's questions in writing or I can answer the questions now.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	378	Let me deal with the payments issue, because there is some confusion as to whether my Department is getting out the payments on time.  Currently our payments to farmers are €45 million ahead of where we were at this time last year.  There are no delays in sending out the single farm payments.  Next week we will distribute €444 million of single farm payments to 85,000 farmers across the country.  This is 50% of their single farm payment.  By the end of next week we will be another €42 million ahead of where we were last year on top of where we currently are.  There are no delays with the two big packages, the disadvantaged area and the single farm payments.  There are some areas where farmers have not got their payments because of mapping problems and the need for clarification on certain points.  Where there are genuine problems is with AEOS payments.  The agri-environment options scheme is a complicated scheme that was introduced previously but it had a series of implications in terms of complexity of mapping, where maps had to be synchronised with maps that were submitted for single farm payment and in many cases they did not match up.  The reason we are obsessed with digitising maps is that in future we will not have delays as a result of mapping.  Having digitised maps allows one to make decisions much more quickly.  There are teething problems with AEOS.

Was it flagged that along the line farmers could potentially lose part of their single farm payment if they cut turf?  The turf cutters cannot establish definitively whether their single farm payment would be affected next year if they went out and cut turf in certain bogs.  From doing some paperwork we have established the potential for a cut of 10% to payments but we cannot ascertain the definitive position.  What is the situation under the current CAP?  More importantly, what will be done to avoid this problem in the future in order that farmers will know what they are signing up to?How will the greening proposals impact on turf cutting?  I am not saying it is the be-all and end-all for everyone but for a lot of farmers it is their main method of heating their houses and cooking food.  What does the Minister think of these proposals?  How will they affect people who use turf as fuel?  Will it affect people outside SACs or have knock-on effects on other designated areas?
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	388	Can the Minister tell us his negotiation position on caps on maximum payments and payments to agribusiness?  How does he propose to handle the negotiations on redistribution between small and large farmers?The document refers to regional flexibility.  To what extent can we anticipate flexibility in terms of allowing each member state to design schemes to meet their particular interests?  Does the Minister see any scope for a joint Twenty-six County and Six County approach to the Commission on the milk quota, even at this late stage, between now and 2015?  Perhaps a joint approach to the Commission might yield some positive results.Does the Minister consider that the State is in a position to maximise any EU funding which will become available under the research and innovation heading or do we need to do preparatory work to ensure we maximise potential?  There has been a lot of discussion about red tape and the need for simplicity.  Would the Minister consider setting up a small group of farmer representatives to examine forms, processes and advise the Minister?  What might appear very simple and straightforward to a person in the Department might seem like an administrative nightmare to a farmer sitting at a kitchen table with a biro.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	389	Deputy Healy referred to the sugar industry.  I took a lot of sugar into the former factory in Mallow and I have a reasonably good practical and theoretical understanding of the industry.  Nobody would like to see it re-emerge more than I would.  However, I will not act on emotion.  The industry needs to make sense commercially.  The price of sugar internationally needs to remain at approximately €500 per tonne or more for it to be viable to produce and process sugar in Ireland.  At the moment the price is well above €700 a tonne.  The industry is more than viable at current sugar price levels.There is a huge shortage of sugar because of a supply problem which is being exacerbated by a quota system in the EU.  Over the summer two professional feasibility studies on reviving the sugar industry and building a sugar factory at a cost of between €350 million and €400 million were presented to me.  A business plan was attached which outlined how those businesses could be successful, viable and commercial, based on growing sugar at a cost of approximately €40 per tonne.  A lot of work is taking place.  People have serious proposals and financial backing to try to make this happen.My role is to try to ensure I provide the political leadership and policy route to allow people to re-enter the industry if they deem it viable to do so.  We need to get rid of sugar quotas to allow Ireland to proceed on that basis because we currently have none.  We were compensated to leave the current EU sugar regime which comes to an end in 2015.  We will not get a quota before then.  If the sugar quota regime is to be continued in Europe we need a slice of it at some stage after 2015 or failing that, an absence of a sugar quota to rebuild the industry if we choose to do so.  The latter is the likely scenario.The Commission's proposals yesterday were news to us because we expected the date to be 2016 but it is now 2015.  There will be strong lobbying from member states which have large EU sugar quotas and are happy that prices are strong to keep sugar quotas in place in Europe until 2016 or, possibly, 2018.  It will be an ongoing political debate.  It is clear where I stand on the issue.  I will be trying to get rid of sugar quotas as soon as possible for this country, which will allow us to realistically consider the commercial options of rebuilding the industry, something which would excite a lot of farmers in the south and south east of the country.On the age profile of farmers, that only 7% of farmers are aged under 35 is totally unacceptable.  If we are serious about food science and production and continuing to build our reputation as the best country in the world to produce quality, safe and sustainable food and the sustainable intensification of food production, which is what we need to be doing, we need young, educated, bright and ambitious people to put their energies into this sector.  I will propose policies in the budget to try to promote and encourage the hand-over of land from one generation to a younger one for the reasons the Deputy outlined.  Unfortunately, from a financial point of view we are more limited than we may have been in the past.  One reason I have pushed the Commission hard on mandating countries to set 2% of their single farm payment moneys aside for young farmers is that I know we are limited in terms of the funds we can provide for that objective.  Therefore, we wanted to try to do it through European funds.  Most people would support that as a progressive step.In response to Deputy Flanagan, I understand there are no implications for single farm payments related to turf cutting.  I heard him raise the point before.  I will double-check the position.  My Department is not responsible for turf cutting; it is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  The current proposal is that 30% of a single farm payment will require a farmer to do certain things.  These include retaining permanent pasture on farms, in which there must be a 5% tolerance; having a crop diversification policy, for example if one is an arable farmer between 5% and 70% of the land needs to have three or more crops, something which will probably change over time; and having an ecological focus area, which means that 7% of land would have to be set aside to promote biodiversity.The current proposal is likely to change substantially by the time we get a final deal.  They are the only three greening proposals attached to the greening payment.  It is important that people know that.  There are a series of other sustainability, environmental and biodiversity issues which may factor into rural development funds, that is pillar 2 moneys, such as climate change.  I support many of those issues, many of which will provide farmers with more opportunities than threats.  The major concern for farmers in terms of single farm payments is the 30% figure which applies to greening and is far too large.  A lot of what is asked of Irish farmers suits them, such as the permanent pasture element, because 80% of our land is used for this.  There will be a lot of change in the greening proposals over the next year or so as we discuss them.  Deputy Colreavy asked how I felt about a cap on the maximum payments and to be honest I find it ridiculous that anyone would get more than €300,000 in a single farm payment; it is indefensible.  I agree with the principle of caps and the Commission is now proposing that once a person goes above €150,000, reductions will apply to the payment, starting at 20% and moving to 100%, meaning there will be no more payments after €300,000.  I would have no problem with that reducing slightly.  I am being told that cap will only affect between six and 12 people or companies in Ireland.While I agree with the remarks on caps, this is not a major political issue for Ireland because it affects so few people.  In principle, I support the Commission's stance but this is a potential bargaining chip for Ireland.  We have huge political issues surrounding flexibility on the redistribution of single farm payment fund within the country so we should use all of our bargaining power to ensure we get the best deal possible on the most important element of these proposals, the flexibility issue.  Rather than making a big stand on the cap issue, we will try to use it to secure the support of other countries on flexibility.On a joint approach between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties, I hope I will be able to speak in a way that many farmers will be comfortable with.  We share many of the same concerns with our colleagues in the North.  I have developed a good relationship with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Michelle O'Neill, and we will continue to discuss in detail how we can support each other as CAP negotiations move forward, and how we can help on milk quotas and the soft landing.  We have checked if it is possible to transfer quota between North and South and it is not a runner at present.  We will continue to examine all possibilities.One of the interesting things in CAP this time is that outside of the CAP funds, there is a considerable chunk of money for research and innovation available to the food sector that was not available before.  We can target research and development funds and innovation funds that are being made available by the Commission under a different category outside CAP that can be applied to the food sector and we should take advantage of it.

There have been two feasibility studies from a commercial angle but has any consideration been given to the Department carrying out an independent study?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	393	At present, no.  We have gone through both studies with a fine tooth comb in the Department.  The figures stand up but the key issue is the impact on sugar prices when and if we get rid of quotas in the European Union, when Germany, France, Poland and Britain dramatically increase the volume of sugar they are producing.  Personally I think it will not collapse, although there will be a reduction in prices.  Whether prices will fall by 40%, which would be needed to make it viable here, remains to be seen.It is important, however, to note that Ireland is not a competitive place, from a global or European perspective, to produce sugar.  Sugar yields and sugar content in sugar beet are not high in Ireland because of the climate.  Producing sugar from sugar beet as opposed to from South American sugar cane is not competitive.  Having said that, because of the extraordinary supply problems with sugar, the likely increase in demand for sugar in future, the importance of sugar security for the food industry, and the value of sugar beet as a rotation crop, which is grown on about 10,000 hectares of land at present when there is no sugar industry but because farmers like to grow it and feed it to cattle, there are many reasons why farmers might like to pursue this course of action.  The responsibility for me is to be up-front about the risks and opportunities and that is why I have said if we can predict a fall in sugar price below €500 per tonne of processed sugar, we are in dangerous territory but if we can make an educated guess that the price will remain about that, we are in an interesting position.

The Minister should try to bring that to a realistic level.  There is ongoing debate between the Department and the CSO on land declared on the single farm payment each year and how much the Department thinks is not claimed in any single farm payment application.  We have heard concerns from family farms that have built up substantial single farm payments but will see that drastically reduced.  Does he accept people will be drastically affected by the proposals as they are before the Commission at present?  Commonage areas are not covered by the single farm payment at present but I trust they will qualify under the new regime.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Going back to the Minister's earlier answer, under the current single farm payment system, can the Minister find out if part of the payment can be taken off farmers, no matter what other penalties are imposed, if they cut turf next year in one of the 55 SAC bogs?  The Minister will have to find that out because the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association is finding it very difficult to get a definitive answer on this.  We wrote to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food asking for a yes or no answer and we got every word in the English language bar yes or no in reply.  We must find this out for definite.What is the Government's policy on the capping of payments in negotiations?  How low could the cap apply below €300,000?  Could it go down to €200,000 or €100,000 maximum?  The less money goes into the rich person's hand, the more might potentially end up in the hands of younger farmers or those farming at a smaller level.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The 7% eco-focus areas include hedgerows.  There are more hedgerows in Ireland per square kilometre than in any other country in Europe and we can count hedgerows as part of the 7%.  In real terms, it is much easier for Irish farmers to set aside that level of land than for many farmers on mainland Europe.From my perspective, however, the idea of setting aside any land that could be used to produce food when there are issues surrounding food security and when Ireland can produce quality, safe food for which there is a strong demand in Europe and globally makes no sense.  If we need to protect areas for ecological reasons we should zone in on protecting those areas, as we do at present.  To require every farm in the country to set land aside, regardless of the conditions, environmental value or biodiversity on the farm seems to me to be a very blunt tool.  We should be more sophisticated than that.With regard to Deputy Kirk's question on farm land for which there has not been an eligibility trigger, I will come back to the Deputy with a more precise answer.  It is my understanding that there are about 500,000 ha that is called naked land.  It does not have the clothes of eligibility on it.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Commonage is eligible, because it is agricultural land.  I do not see an issue there.Cross-compliance is the terminology used when agricultural payments are lost because rules regarding respect for special areas of conservation, SACs, or biodiversity are broken.  I will come back to the Deputy with a proper answer on this, but it is my understanding that if a farm within an SAC blatantly breaks the rules there is probably a cross-compliance implication.  In other words, the farmer could, potentially, lose payments.  I will come back to the Deputy in writing with a more exact answer than that.The Deputy's final point requires a response.  The idea that we should take money from the rich to give it to the poor is a gross over-simplification of what the single farm payment is about.  The single farm payment supports the production of sustainable food producing systems on Irish farms.  We should recognise and reward the production of food, on a small scale on small farms and on a big scale on bigger farms.  We should not penalise large farms because they happen to be efficient at producing food.  The single farm payment recognises that producing food in Ireland and across Europe is more expensive than in other parts of the world, because of what our consumers demand of our farmers.  They demand traceability, safety, inspections and limitations on hormone use in beef.  They raise issues relating to climate change, sustainability, animal husbandry and all of the other things that are required of farmers in Ireland when they produce food.  The single farm payment recognises the fact that those requirements make it more expensive to produce food.  If we are to be competitive in terms of food pricing, consumers must pay something if they are going to demand those standards from food producers.We have, and will have, a series of other mechanisms,  under Pillar 2, to deal with issues related to the need to keep people on the land.  We must recognise that in NATURA 2000 areas or SACs people have limitations put on them and that there needs to be some compensation for that.  Deputy Kirk rightly raised those issues.  From an environmental point of view, that is why we have disadvantaged areas and less favoured areas, LFAs.  That is why we had REPS, which was a hugely successful scheme.  We now have the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, to follow on from that, because it is what we can afford at present.We should not lump all these issues into the single argument that we need to take money from rich people and give it to poor people or take money from big farmers and give it to small farmers. That is not what we are at.  The single farm payment supports an agricultural system and rewards people who are producing food responsibly and efficiently, as well as providing some support for people who are not able to do that because of the land they operate on.  In the Common Agricultural Policy, as a package, there is a series of other tools to deal with the necessary social supports in rural Ireland, particularly in disadvantaged areas.It is important that I make this point.  The primary importance of the single farm payment, which is Pillar 1 money, is in supporting the growth and expansion of the agrifood industry in Ireland, predominantly by supporting farmers to produce food and to expand and grow.  There will be some redistribution of money within Ireland from what has been referred to as the productive sector to what is referred to, I think unfairly, as the unproductive sector.  It is an insult to say anyone's farm is unproductive.We need to tailor a solution that suits Ireland best and allows us to do what we aspire to do in growing the agrifood industry.  What the Commission is currently proposing will not allow that.  That is why there is a flexibility issue in the distribution of single farm payment money.  We cannot simply maintain the exact status quo based on historical payments that have a base year going back to 2002.  We need to put in place a new system that works.  We will be working hard to do that and we have some ideas that are already semi-developed in that area.  We will be working with farm organisations, stakeholders and farmers, in discussion groups when and where appropriate, to get the balance right and ensure that we treat people fairly and allow the industry to continue to grow.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I call on the Minister to make his final statement in reply to the debate.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	402	In many ways, this is the most important debate of my period as Minister.  To discuss the Commission's proposals is of significant importance.  That is why I requested that we debate the proposals in the House rather than relying on press releases or PR spin.  This is also why, this morning, I sent every Deputy a detailed analysis of the Commission document.  I hope all Deputies received that and that it helped to inform their contributions.  I will continue to do this.  I do not want to manoeuvre party political advantage.  As I receive information and as we develop ideas I will try to be as open and transparent as I can be and to take people's ideas on board.We are talking about the future of 128,000 farm families, many of whom rely heavily on income from schemes supported by the European Union, particularly the single farm payment.  During the period of the next Common Agricultural Policy, payments of approximately €12 billion will come into Ireland.  This is a significant contribution to the Irish economy.  In reviewing the Common Agricultural Policy, we are trying to modernise farming and develop our thinking as to how farming should be done and how food should be produced in the European Union.Deputy Luke Flanagan and others said they thought the European Union has been inconsistent and that policy has changed.  This is true.  Policy has changed and it will change again in the future because food production and the food debate changes.  Seven or eight years ago, the European Union was trying to create an artificial market for food production, to keep supply down and demand up, to keep prices up and to import the excess food we needed cheaply from other parts of the world.  There is now an entirely different debate.  We are talking about food security and how we can ensure that Europe can feed itself and make a contribution to feeding people in other parts of the world who cannot feed themselves at present.  Countries we currently import from will not be able to export in five or ten years time when their own populations grow and they struggle to feed themselves, never mind export cheaply to Europe.  The food debate and food security debate change.  The environmental debate changes.  The climate change debate did not exist 15 years ago.  It is now becoming a huge, and potentially limiting, factor for food production in the European Union and further afield.As new challenges, obstacles and opportunities emerge policies must respond to them.  The Common Agricultural Policy is about responding to the food needs of consumers in the European Union and further afield and trying to support a farming and agricultural base that can meet those needs over the next seven years or so.   The European Commission has got it right in terms of its proposals to support young farmers, keeping in place the envelope rather than reducing it and in regard to capping and so on.  However, in some areas it has got it wrong and we will have to change that.  It is my job and that of Members to ensure we get a decision and conclusion to the CAP debate that makes sense for Ireland.The job of the EU is to put on the table a policy proposal that is based on a common agricultural policy review for half a billion people in 27 member states.  Members cannot expect that everything in that proposal will be tailor made for Ireland.  It will not.  However, it is a starting point.  The EU puts in place a policy across the Union following which countries must then lobby, negotiate, use their skills and influence and build alliances and understanding in discussions and debate on specific areas of concern.  Ireland has specific areas of concern.  We are unique in the EU in terms of the percentage of food we produce that needs to be exported.We are also unique in the EU in terms of our levels of ambition for the agri-food industry.  As I understand it, Ireland is the only country that has a comprehensive growth template, namely, Food Harvest 2020 which the entire industry, including farmers, processors, food companies and Government buy into.  We now need to tailor what is a broad based document, which seeks to provide a solution for CAP reform across the Union, for Irish farmers and Irish specific concerns.  The big issue is how we redistribute single farm payment funds within Ireland.  We need to have this debate in a way that does not cause huge division in rural Ireland.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick — safety concerns regarding delivery of bottom ash to a landfill site in Phillipstown, County Louth; (2) Deputy Derek Keating — Exchequer funding for the National Transport Authority, in particular the provision of bus services to west and south west Dublin; (3) Deputy Noel Harrington — the construction of the Bantry town bypass on the N71, in respect of which planning and design are complete; the land acquisition process is practically complete and for which funding has yet to be announced; the bypass is critical for Bantry owing to construction of a new secondary school due to be opened later this year and allied significant congestion; the project has been on the table since I was a member of Cork County Council in 1999 and for a long time before that and I understand it qualifies as a shovel ready project having completed the planning and land acquisition process; (4) Deputy Dessie Ellis — the need to address housing conditions at Balgaddy estate, Lucan, County Dublin; (5) Deputy Brendan Griffin — the need for a new school building at Milltown Presentation secondary school, Milltown, County Kerry; (6) Deputy Patrick O'Donovan — the need for the Government to prioritise a national dental campaign that involves the appointment of a chief dental officer; (7) Deputy Paschal Donohoe — the regulation of the mortgage broker sector; (8) Deputy Michael McNamara — revenue loss to the Exchequer arising from increases in off-licence sales and decrease in on-premise consumption; (9) Deputy Thomas P. Broughan — to ask the Minister for Health if critical funding for St. Michael's House, Ballymun Road, Dublin 9 will be maintained under budget 2012 given the series of budget cuts the organisation has already experienced over the past three years and the impressive range of services that it and its dedicated staff continue to provide for citizens with an intellectual disability across the northside and beyond; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (10) Deputy Dan Neville — the increase by 4% to 11,966 in presentations to hospital nationally due to deliberate self harm; (11) Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin — the imminent construction of flood defences on the Clontarf promenade, Dublin; (12) Deputy Michael Colreavy — concern regarding the future viability of Galway Airport; (13) Deputy Billy Kelleher — to ask the Minister for Health, given the number of patients waiting on trolleys is set to reach 500, to outline his plans to deal with overcrowding in accident and emergency departments during the winter months and if he will make a statement on the matter; and (14) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett — the escalating crisis in hospital accident and emergency departments and local hospital downgrades.The matters raised by Deputies Paschal Donohoe, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Dessie Ellis and Derek Keating have been selected for discussion.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, for attending the House to respond to it.I was prompted to raise this issue as a result of a desperately sad case in which I became involved last week — which has received some coverage in The Irish Examiner — having visited a family who have been touched by the unbelievable tragedy of losing a family member through suicide.  The financial circumstances of the family at the time of this sad event are likely to have contributed to what happened.  At the very least, they created an environment where pressure became acute and unbearable for someone.  I have looked at the chain of events leading up to this sad event and at the financial transactions which led to the creation of that environment.  There is no doubt but that mistakes were made by many parties along the way, including, tragically, the family involved.I want to focus on a particular part of that chain, namely, the general role played by mortgage brokers and financial intermediaries.  Much of what I learned in terms of regulation, if any exists, in this sector caused me concern.  The family concerned received a mortgage, the application form for which contained no evidence of a bank account.  Also, the person granted the mortgage did not have life assurance, was not able to produce evidence of income and had already built up mortgage arrears from a previous mortgage.  Despite this, a mortgage many times the amount of the original mortgage was granted.A particular link in this transaction is the role of the mortgage broker-intermediary who received information from the family and used that information to apply for a mortgage which the family had no ability to repay.  As I stated earlier, responsibility rests everywhere.   However, money was loaned to people who had no ability to repay it.  The money should never have been given to them.From my review of this sector since then, a number of things have become clear.  We need to move quickly from a system of registration to regulation.  That is essential.  Whatever regulation exists needs to be strengthened and a number of new features need to be added.  First, we need to have at the core of this sector protection of the borrower, in particular a borrower who could become vulnerable in the future.  Second, we must have in place a system of cross-referencing.  As I understand it, a person in this sector against whom there is a ruling from the financial ombudsman can continue to practise, including under a different name or different company.  I would appreciate clarification on that point from the Minister.Money is being transferred from clients to brokers to banks.  There must be in place a system that ensures there is a verifiable paper trail of money transferred and that this is done by people who should be doing so.  My final point relates to insurance, in particular run-off insurance.  For example, where a solicitor who is no longer in operation is sued because of something he or she did when in operation and the person taking the action is successful he or she will be paid from the solicitor's insurance.  As I understand it, no such policy exists in respect of mortgage brokers who are now becoming debt intermediaries.The Central Bank is currently investigating the case in which I am involved.  I believe these matters need to be urgently brought to public attention.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could clarify in his response what regulation currently exists in this sector and if the general thrust of what I have outlined in terms of the need for a strengthened regime can be acted upon.  It needs to be.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I apologise for my delay in coming to the House.  I thank Deputy Donohoe for raising this important case, the particulars of which I am aware.  It has a much wider application because of the number of people who used this option to obtain financing and mortgage deals when there was a flood of opportunities to do so in the past.Mortgage intermediaries that intend to provide services to consumers must be authorised by the Central Bank in accordance with section 116 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  A mortgage intermediary is defined as a person, other than a mortgage lender or a credit institution, who, in return for commission or some other form of consideration, arranges or offers to arrange for a mortgage lender to provide a consumer with a housing loan, or introduces a consumer to an intermediary who arranges or offers to arrange for a mortgage lender to provide the consumer with such a loan.  It is an offence for a person to engage in being a mortgage intermediary unless he or she is the holder of an authorisation granted for that purpose by the Central Bank and holds a letter of appointment in writing from each undertaking for which he or she is an intermediary.The Central Bank is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of over 2,000 mortgage intermediaries.  I have no indication from the Central Bank of a lacuna in the law in this regard.The points raised by Deputy Donohoe about a particular case have a wide application.  It would be important, therefore, that his statement in the House would be transmitted immediately to the Central Bank.  He has informed the House that a complaint is now before the Central Bank concerning the case.  It is not the Minister for Finance's position to comment on this complaint and it is better to await the deliberations of the Central Bank.Deputy Donohoe has also raised the fundamental issue of the supervision of the granting of authorisation to mortgage intermediaries.  Is there a proper supervision regime in place?  Is the complaints system adequate to allow for the removal of a negligent mortgage intermediary?  If the Central Bank believes the law needs to be changed to provide additional consumer protection, as outlined by Deputy Donohoe, the Government would be open to suggestions.  However, the authority in the first instance rests with the Central Bank to determine if such a change is necessary and what further policy changes may need to be considered by the Government.  It is important the Central Bank makes its determination on the particular case raised by the Deputy known soon as it has wider implications across financial services supervision.

I am not suggesting the entire industry is performing in the way I described in the case that came to my attention.  However, other individuals in this sector have also come across such difficulties but, thankfully, have not resulted in the tragedy I encountered.I suspect there is an effective process in place for registration but not for regulation.  A change is occurring where parts of the sector in question are morphing into debt intermediaries, a business which takes on people's debt, restructures it and then charges them for doing so.  The point I am making would then have greater applicability because one would be dealing with people who would be far more vulnerable than people who are applying to take on a mortgage or debt in the first place.I will return to this matter in the future.  I appreciate the Minister of State's reply.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I agree with Deputy Donohoe that the issue is one of regulation and supervision.  There is little point in handing out authorisations unless the actual work is properly supervised and regulated.  The Government is minded across a pan-European level to see how we can strengthen the law in this regard.  This is also a key issue of the Polish EU Presidency and one which could get further direction from the European Union.People who believe the advice they received from a mortgage intermediary is defective, or even bordering on criminal, can take the matter up with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  People must not feel they have nowhere to go, as there is much advice on such matters.The important issues raised by Deputy Donohoe need to be teased out further with the Central Bank.  Much more work needs to be done in the area of financial services regulation and supervision.

No public representatives, residents' groups or business groups were represented on this committee.  However, the environmental impact statement, EIS, states the main stakeholders were present.  The minutes of the meeting indicate that council officials realised, even at that point, the need to provide clear images and drawings for the public consultation process.  This recommendation was not pursued, however.A consultation evening was held in St. Anthony's Parish Church in Clontarf on 12 June 2006 to deal with the scope of the information to be included in the EIS.  Residents' groups were invited to the meeting.  According to a council e-mail of Tuesday, 11 October 2006, the public consultation process on the flood defences-arterial water mains did not commence until 3 December 2007.  Accordingly, this meeting cannot be considered to have been part of that process.  Indeed, the EIS had not even been completed at that stage.In November 2007, all residents' groups were written to informing them that Dublin City Council was about to apply to An Bord Pleanála for planning permission through the submission of an EIS, as yet unseen by residents, businesses or local representatives.  The letter also informed them a period of public consultation would take place and that full details of the project would be on public display for eight weeks in Dublin City Council's civic office, Marino Library, none of which are in the Clontarf area itself, and on the council's website.  On 3 December 2007, this submission and public consultation was further advertised in the Irish Independent and this date was the commencement of the public consultation period.One day later, on 4 December 2007, Dublin City Council applied to An Bord Pleanála for permission for the works as outlined in the EIS and first advertised to the public one day previously.  Subsequently, in July 2008 planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála.There is no evidence of any involvement of either public representatives, residents or local businesses, prior to a decision being made in September 2005, that the preferred option for the works was for bunds-walls rather than four other options under consideration.  Although the council has accepted the height recommendation changed after plans were first presented to local councillors in 2006, this was not communicated and no supplemental presentation was made detailing the alterations or the reasons held by the council for departing from the original proposal.  Prior to the planning application being made to An Bord Pleanála in December 2007, no public representatives or residents groups had sight of a completed environmental impact statement, EIS, or had an opportunity to provide feedback or comment on it.  The EIS was made available on 3 December — the application was made to An Bord Pleanála on 4 December.  As a result, the only opportunity these stakeholders had to make an input into the process was that afforded them by the An Bord Pleanála system at a cost of €50.  Although the EIS was made available after the application had been made to An Bord Pleanála, it was never available at any public location in Clontarf.  My point is that the process was deficient from the beginning.I wish to bring the Minister of State's attention to another matter.  The development is in close proximity to a number of special protection areas and a special area of conservation, namely, north Dublin Bay.  I direct the Minister of State to Article 6(3) of the habitats directive and the guidance provided by the Commission, those being, EC (2000), EC (2002) and EC (2006).  Any plan or project that may have a significant effect on a special area of conservation shall be subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives.  This appropriate assessment should include, where appropriate, obtaining the opinion of the general public and must comply with the requirements as set forth by the directive and clarified by the Commission's guidance notes and the European Court of Justice, ECJ, cases C-127/02 and C-418/04.The EIS on the works in question does not comply with the requirements of the directive and relevant explanatory documents, since no appropriate assessment was undertaken.  In taking the decision under An Bord Pleanála reference 29N.JA0008, the competent authority — Dublin City Council — has failed to take account of the appropriate assessment of the implications of the development for the designated Natura 2000 site in light of the site's conservation objectives and has not made certain that the development will not affect the integrity of the site.Like the council, will the Minister of State accept that the consultation process was deficient?  Will he accept the documentation that I will provide him for his officials to examine?  Will his officials examine the relevant European legislation and the ECJ cases I have outlined?  I will be as quick as possible in the four minutes allowed to me.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I know the area well, having played there as a young boy before going to the west side of the city.  I also know of people's concerns, but I must point out that this is a Dublin City Council scheme.  The objective of the Office of Public Works, OPW, which has national responsibility for providing policy and funding, is to work with local authorities in the delivery of such schemes.I will set out the facts.  The Clontarf sea front area was identified as one of the areas most at risk of flooding in the Dublin coastal flood protection project study, which was completed in 2005 by international expert consultants Royal Haskoning and commissioned by Dublin City Council with funding from the OPW.  Following the study's completion, Dublin City Council appointed Royal Haskoning to design a flood relief scheme for the area.  The scheme was designed to the normal standards required for coastal flood protection, including protection against a flood with an annual exceedance probability of 0.5%, typically known as a 200-year flood event, with an allowance for climate change.The OPW understands that Dublin City Council made available full details of the flood defence project to residents, local businesses and elected representatives at the various informal and formal public consultations in 2006 and 2007 leading up to the submission of a full EIS to An Bord Pleanála in 2007.  The submission was also advertised in the national press, site notices were erected and the project details and EIS report were put on public display in the council's civic offices and in Marino Library.  The EIS took full account of all aspects of the project, including the visual impact of the flood defence structures.  The EIS and the project were subsequently approved by An Bord Pleanála in 2008.Dublin City Council has since advanced the scheme as part of the north city water main project.  The procurement process for the overall scheme, which includes the north city water supply scheme phases 1 and 2 and the flood defence works, has been progressed as one contract for reasons of efficiency and economies of cost.  The OPW has agreed in principle to provide the funding to undertake the flood defence aspects of the works, amounting to approximately 46% of the overall costs.  This is Dublin City Council's scheme, not the Government's.  We provide the money for schemes and set national policy frameworks.This scheme incorporates the use of landscaping rather than extensive wall construction.  This is designed to minimise the impact and, in so far as it is possible, retain the character of the Clontarf sea front.  The council accepts that there will be a loss of visual amenity.  Without this project, however, the area will continue to flood, which the Deputy knows it has done frequently.I understand that, in response to concerns raised by residents and members of the business community in recent weeks, Dublin City Council made a presentation to a special meeting of councillors of the north central area committee yesterday afternoon.  At that meeting, the council agreed to arrange meetings with the residents for next week with a further area committee to take place on 7 November.  The OPW had a member of staff at the meeting who explained that the rationale for the OPW providing funding for the scheme was based on the scheme being cost beneficial and that it would conform to the normal standards applying to such coastal schemes.  The OPW awaits the outcome of the further consultation process.

Will he accept the documentation?  If I forward it to his Department, will he ask his officials to investigate under section 21 of the Planning and Development Act on An Bord Pleanála whether every statutory box was ticked in respect of the consultation process?  Will his office also take into consideration the European legislation to which I referred?  I will forward it to his office and to other Ministers with responsibility in this regard.  Will the Minister of State take into consideration the insurance implications of these works going ahead or not going ahead and engage with the IIF?  If his office commits to doing so, it would provide solace to the residents and wider community affected.  These are three simple suggestions and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The suggestions are good, but they will not make any difference.  The key issue is that this is a Dublin City Council scheme.  The council is looking for money from us.  To obtain that, it must show that the State will get value for the money we spend.  We are prepared to consider any alternative arising from the consultation with local councillors last night and with residents next week.  If the council makes an alternative proposal, we are prepared to consider it.The only criterion we have when an application is made is whether it is worth spending money.  There is no point in spending money if it has no value when an event occurs.  All of the EU legislation in the world will not make a difference.  This is a question of getting value for the State's money.  If an alternative proposal is brought to our attention by the council, we will consider it.We have set money aside for the scheme.  If it is not spent this year, I cannot guarantee the people of Clontarf that it will be spent next year.  If a flooding event occurs, I ask people to realise that the houses, businesses and communities along the long Clontarf Road will suffer the brunt of it.The only way to stop the floods is to build a wall or a variety of other schemes that may help.  We are open to considering all alternatives, but time is of the essence.  Given the fact that we are not the party conducting this process, our task is to fund something if it has value and will stop a flood.  Otherwise, the money will not be provided.  The next time a flood occurs, Deputies will ask me why we did not do something.Dublin City Council must sort this issue out with the local community and local councillors in the first instance.  Assuming it does, I will consider any alternative proposal.  We have a clear model on which we determine cost-benefit analyses.  If an alternative delivers value for the State's investment, we will consider it and progress the scheme.  I hope I have been fair, honest and forthcoming in responding to the Deputy.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Recently, I visited the Balgaddy estate with my colleague, Eoin Ó Broin, where I met residents and had a tour of the general area.  Balgaddy estate is a 400 unit social housing estate comprising three developments, namely, Meile An Rí, Buirg An Rí and Tor An Rí.  It was built between 2004 and 2007 on the border of Lucan and Clondalkin.  The design of the estate won awards from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in 2004.  It was to be a model urban village with community facilities, employment opportunities and social and affordable housing.  Today, for many of its residents Balgaddy is a nightmare.From the very start, residents complained of damp, structural cracks inside and outside the houses, faulty heating systems and leaks from badly constructed roofs.  The promised community facilities were never provided and units held over for this purpose remain vacant.  So much for the social dividend that was promised.  To date, the only facility provided is a children's play area which was completed recently, seven years after the residents moved in.From the very beginning, Balgaddy residents raised their concerns with South Dublin County Council.  When no adequate response from the council was forthcoming they formed the Balgaddy Working Together group in an attempt to force the council to meet its obligations.  Seven years later, the residents are angry and frustrated at the false promises and neglect of the council, and rightly so.In response to the inaction of the council, the group in conjunction with the Clondalkin Lucan area partnership commissioned independent engineers to carry out a survey of 40 properties in the estate.  The report by Buckeridge Forristal Partnership Consulting Engineers was published in June and found significant damp and mould in many of the homes caused by roof leaks, faulty heating and plumbing and defective windows.  The report recommended details of action on each of the issues concerned.  The extent of the problems confirm without any doubt that these issues are structural and in need of a systematic and proactive response.While primary responsibility for resolving the problems in Balgaddy rests with South Dublin County Council, the scale of the problem requires the involvement of the Minister of State and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Residents in Balgaddy have a right to live in decent and comfortable homes.  The council has a legal responsibility to ensure its tenants live in adequate housing.  Where a local authority is failing in this regard the Department has an obligation to intervene.  Health and safety factors alone dictate that the Minister of State's intervention is necessary.  Will he outline to the House today what he knows about the problems in Balgaddy and what action he and the Department can take to address the very real problems which blight the lives of hundreds of families in Balgaddy?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Balgaddy was designed as an urban village scheme to include a mix of social, voluntary and private affordable dwellings.  Five phases of construction were proposed in the Balgaddy scheme, for which a masterplan was prepared in the year 2000.  A total of 400 units have been completed by Gama Construction Limited, the main contractor appointed by South Dublin County Council.My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, understands from the housing authority that issues have arisen which require remedial works on window sashes, roof flashings and external plaster cracks.  There is also an issue with condensation and mould growth which arose as a result of increased insulation linked to ventilation levels required by the building regulations.  In some cases condensation is a result of building fabric failure and in others by the pattern of tenant use.In the past year, a considerable amount of work has been carried out by council staff, and contractors working on their behalf, to address all the issues arising.  A dedicated team under the direction of the county architect is now systematically inspecting and evaluating the condition of all housing stock which has been subject of complaints and carrying out any necessary remedial works on a house by house basis.  This process will continue until all affected units are addressed.  Considerable progress has been made to date and is continuing.  A pilot contract to replace window sashes in 14 units has been put in place.A building survey was commissioned and carried out some months ago by BFP Consulting Engineers, a draft of which was received by the council in July.  This is being reviewed against the council programme and any fresh information supplied is being factored into the ongoing work schedule.  The contents of the report were broadly in line with the surveys carried out by council technical staff and already being addressed by on-site teams.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Representatives of the Balgaddy group are in the Gallery and what the Minister of State has described is not what they tell me is happening.  In light of the serious concerns, supported by an independent report, will the Minister of State consider following up requests from me on behalf of the residents?  Will he meet a delegation of the Balgaddy residents, preferably in Balgaddy, to discuss their concerns and to explore possible courses of action available to him to assist them in having their concerns addressed?  Will he meet the South Dublin County Council director of housing, Billy Coman, and the county manager, Joe Horan, to discuss the situation and to ensure the concerns of the residents are adequately addressed?  Will he ask his officials to prepare a report on the contents of the Buckeridge Forristal Partnership Consulting Engineers report, and an earlier report as yet unpublished commissioned by Cara Housing Association, into housing problems at Meile An Rí Drive and to make these reports available to the House?  Will he organise an inspection of the houses in case an issue arises with regard to pyrite?  I flag this just in case it needs to be addressed.  Will he outline what powers and resources are available to him to intervene in this matter and assist South Dublin County Council and the residents of Balgaddy to address the many structural problems in their homes?  A very high percentage of children and residents with disabilities live in the estate.  The number is more than the national average.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board these concerns and address them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and I recognise the presence in the Gallery of the residents concerned.  I will make the Deputy's request known to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, who has responsibility for housing and planning, with regard to a meeting between him and the residents concerned.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that on Monday I will meet Joe Horan and the staff of South Dublin County Council and I will raise the matter.  Although I have no responsibility for this matter, it arises in the functional area in which I live and I have no difficulty in raising the matter with South Dublin County Council.  I will send Joe Horan a copy of the Deputy's remarks and ask that the issue be addressed at our Monday meeting.I presume the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is willing to examine any report.  It should be published and does not need to be put in the library of the House.  This is a housing authority function, and ultimately a matter for South Dublin County Council's housing department as the housing authority responsible.  If it requests additional support from the Department I am sure the Department will consider it given all of the circumstances.It is also fair to state that work has taken place.  I am sure residents are of the view that not enough has happened but under the circumstances we must ensure the work continues and that the project work is mapped out in terms of time and resources so local people can see the mistakes, appalling and all as they are, can be resolved for the community so it is an area in which people want to live and of which they are proud.  I will ensure the Minister of State is aware of the Deputy's comments.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion under Topical Issues today.  I wish to raise a serious issue affecting the lives of many thousands of people, the local and national economy in the greater Dublin area and the personal lives of many people.The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport recently announced the cancellation for the time being at least of the metro west project, due to the previous Government's mismanagement of the economy and given the situation inherited by the current Government.  Although this was bad news for commuters and for the economy in general, it is now compounded by what I consider to be the carry-on in Dublin Bus.I have learned in recent weeks of the impact of changes imposed by Dublin Bus on the citizens of the greater western area, including areas within my own constituency such as Lucan, Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle and many other areas outside my constituency.Dublin Bus has introduced a new No. 13 bus service with little or no meaningful consultation with the citizens of Clondalkin.  The No. 51 service was discontinued and this has caused considerable confusion and disruption.  I spoke to some people who informed me that they waited for the No. 51 bus, saw the No. 13 bus pass by and only later realised that this was the replacement service.  This is an example of the confusion which can cause great difficulties in people's lives.In the coming weeks, Dublin Bus is planning to remove the No. 78 and No. 79 bus services to be replaced with a new No. 40 service, which will follow a new route. There has not been any adequate, meaningful consultation, notice or discussion.  If mismanagement were an Olympic sport, Dublin Bus would be in line for a gold medal.In my own constituency, the No. 26 bus route has changed without adequate meaningful consultation or discussion.  The Nos. 25, 25A and 25B services have been reduced and the No. 26, when it arrives in Lucan, is generally three-quarters or completely full.  The No. 66X is a wonderful service but because of its express nature it bypasses Lucan village and many of the highly developed populated areas in Lucan.  When these buses arrive in Palmerstown, with 3,000 homes and more than 7,000 people, the bus service is not adequate between the hours of 7.45 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. and is often non-existent.The Government provides approximately €25 million to €30 million a year in funding to Dublin Bus.  In the circumstances, the National Transport Authority has shown little evidence of value for money when such chaos looms.  Every morning, many hundreds of people from Rathcoole to Maynooth are stranded as a result of the changes in the bus services and the bus routes.  Their grievance — which I support — is that there is very little meaningful or worthwhile consultation.  If consultation is to be meaningful, it must involve the user of the service who is the most important person.  The consultation process should also include traders' associations, the local school communities, local residents' associations and public representatives.People are suffering more stress in the daily circumstances of their lives.  The priority for the Government is to bring about a recovery in the economy and the transport needs of the people must be met.  I am very unhappy at the way in which these needs are being affected.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I thank the Deputy for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House and to my attention.  As the Deputy will be aware, I do not have an operational role in Dublin Bus and nor do I make decisions as regards individual bus routes.  These are matters for the company in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, which is the regulator.  The funding of public service obligation services is governed by a public transport contract between the NTA and Dublin Bus.The Deloitte cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann was published in January 2009.  The review found Bus Éireann to be largely efficient.  However, it identified some scope for greater efficiencies in Dublin Bus.  Following the publication of that report, Dublin Bus undertook an extensive review of its bus network and subsequently announced its plans for the reorganisation of routes and timetables.  The objective of the redesign is to provide current and future bus customers with a service that will be modern, accessible, integrated, easy to understand, punctual and frequent.The redesign is delivering real and tangible benefits to the vast majority of bus users.  For example, when completed later this year, there will be a doubling in routes with frequency of ten minutes or better.  A total of 60% of customers will be carried on high frequency routes whereas this stood at 23% previously.  There will also be increased interchange opportunities with heavy and light rail services.  The redesign will reduce the lay-over of buses in the city centre and improve traffic flows, thereby leading to an improved city centre environment.I understand that Dublin Bus has held over 30 public meetings and 250 meetings with key stakeholders as part of its consultation programme.  All changes are advertised in advance through social, national and local media as well as leaflet drops to houses in areas serviced by the bus routes where changes occur.  Dublin Bus is continuing to ensure best practice is achieved in the delivery of the service and that the new network enhances this efficiency as part of the network review progresses.  All schedules reflect the new traffic levels.I support the efforts of Dublin Bus to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness under the network direct programme and significant efficiencies and savings have already been achieved.  Given the losses recorded by Dublin Bus in 2010 and further reductions in the PSO subvention due over the coming years, it is important that the Deloitte report and the network direct programme are fully delivered upon to ensure the viability of the service.With regard to some of the specific routes referred to by the Deputy, route No. 13 was recently introduced offering Clondalkin and Ballymun a new travel option.  A full consultation was held in the areas with a public road show held at Clondalkin library on 2 February and at the Ballymun civic centre on 3 February.  Revisions were made to services and these were made available on the website prior to the changes.  On Friday 23 September, details on the proposals were published on the Dublin Bus website, Twitter page and Facebook page and e-mails were sent to Deputies and councillors.  From 26 to 30 September, a door-to-door leaflet drop was carried out and 21,900 leaflets were delivered.  In the week beginning 26 September, notices appeared in the Northside People and the Southside People; on Wednesday 28 September, notices appeared in the Irish Independent; on Friday 30 September, notices appeared in the Evening Herald and information brochures were delivered to the local public libraries and credit unions.I am informed there are no plans to change the Nos. 78 and 79 bus routes on Monday as has been suggested by some parties.  A consultation was held in the Ballyfermot area throughout October with a road show in the Ballyfermot civic centre on 21 October 2010, with consultations taking at least four weeks.  There will be no change to the service without advance notice of at least nine days to customers, including the distribution of leaflets to homes in the vicinity of the route.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	422	My response is that it is not working.  If all of this consultation process was meaningful why are there so many complaints and why are so many people stranded?  I have attended many consultation meetings and my abiding memory is how the issues raised by people are not addressed in this consultation process.  I was very careful in my use of the words, "meaningful consultation".  If consultation is to be meaningful it has to take into account what people are saying and hence the confusion that has arisen.I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I ask that he agree to convene a meeting with the National Transport Authority to review some of these exercises, given the impact on people's lives, the inconvenience and the grievances expressed.  They have difficulties in getting to schools, colleges, places of work.  This is not working.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	423	Consultation has to be meaningful but it can only be meaningful to a certain point.  This is an efficiency operation as much as anything and no matter what happens, savings have to be made and savings are best made now by straightening out bus routes and having fewer and more frequent bus services rather than having less frequency on existing bus routes.  My experience in Dublin 15, where we also have Network Direct, is that there have been complaints from people who have been discommoded and who are suffering with a worse bus service.  Most people have a better bus service, but they do not complain nor tell us they think the bus service is better.  It is interesting to note that despite the economy being flat, the numbers using Dublin Bus this year have stabilised and have even increased slightly.  This is a good sign that more people are using the bus this year than last year.On the National Transport Authority, it is conducting a network review of the Lucan area and is doing a look-back exercise to assess the impact the changes have had in the area.  I support that.  I do not want to get involved in a meeting about individual bus routes; it is just not possible for me to micro-manage at that level.  If the Deputy would find it useful, I could arrange for him to meet with the NTA on the issue or to meet directly with senior management of Dublin Bus.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department, which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  However, it is important to recognise that the majority of people receive the entitlement due to them.In terms of control work, in 2009 nearly 751,000 cases were reviewed by the Department and some €484 million was recorded as savings achieved.  In 2010, more than 929,000 cases were recorded as reviews and some €483 million was recorded as being achieved in control savings.  However, due to industrial action, the total 2010 control savings and reviews were not fully recorded.  In the period January to August 2011, nearly 401,000 cases were reviewed and some €388 million control savings have been recorded.  The savings achieved to date this year are substantially ahead of the €281 million achieved in the same period last year.  Under the fraud initiative 2011-13, there is a provisional target of achieving €625 million in control savings in 2012.  This is an increase of €85 million on the 2011 target.Control savings are an estimate of savings from various control activities across the schemes in payment, but are not actual moneys recovered by the Department.  If this control work did not take place, social welfare expenditure would increase by this level over time.Control activity is also focused on the prevention of fraud and error at new claim stage.  This is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes.  Savings made from the prevention of fraud and error at application stage cannot be estimated as the claims in question will not go into payment.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThere are some 620 staff whose work includes control activities.  This figure includes staff involved in the processing and payment of new claims, including staff in investigation units who work at local, regional and headquarters levels.  Some 200 of those staff work full-time on control work, while the other 420 staff are responsible both for routine investigations in relation to new claims on the various schemes and for reviews of customers' claims.  Of the 200 inspectors, 89 are in the special investigation unit, SIU, whose exclusive function is fraud prevention, detection and deterrence.I recently launched a new fraud initiative 2011-13, which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure public confidence and trust in the system.  There are a number of themes and approaches in this plan as follows: greater inter-agency co-operation among public bodies at national and local level to combat fraud and abuse; greater presence of social welfare inspectors on the ground; the targeting of sectors where fraud is more likely to occur; new ways to recover overpayments to be examined; increased penalties for those operating in the hidden economy to be examined; greater liaison at national and, in particular, at local level with employers, their representative organisations and businesses generally to ensure good information exchange on emerging fraudulent trends in the labour market and to maintain a fair and level playing pitch for all enterprises; the roll-out of the new public service card; and the enhancement of the technical and auditing capacity of the Department through modern data matching and data interrogation techniques.I consider that the combination of these elements of the plan will lead to more focused and efficient activity and to more trust in and credibility of the social protection system.  This fraud initiative is a work in progress and covers the period 2011 to 2013.  It will be reviewed periodically and updated, as required, given emerging trends.Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments, businesses run on a legitimate basis and taxpayers.  As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I thank the Minister for her response.  Am I correct in saying there has been no major dividend in savings this year?  Was the target inherited by the Minister not €540 million for this year?  Last year's target was €550 million and €483 million was recorded as achieved, up to the time industrial action curtailed the activities.  Has that industrial action continued this year and is that the reason this year's target may not be achieved?There seems to be no major increase in the number of cases under review.  In 2009, there were approximately 750,000 cases reviewed and to August this year, 401,000 have been reviewed.  In March of this year there were 89 inspectors targeting this area.  Are there more now considering what the Minister has been saying in recent months with regard to the plan she has brought forward to target this area specifically and to make savings which might allow her to retain the rates of payment?  Will she elaborate on this?  While the Minister intends the targeted review to be a success, based on these figures and the comparison with recent years, is it as successful as she thought it would be?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	426	We have figures up to August, as the year is not complete yet.  There were 401,000 reviews up to that date and these resulted in some €388 million in control savings.  This compares with €281 million achieved in the same period last year.  Therefore, the staff of the Department are doing very well on this.  The reviews are yielding more control savings.  We will know the total outturn by the end of the year, but the review is yielding significant savings.With regard to the inspectors and fraud, the work of approximately 620 staff includes control activity.  This includes staff involved in the processing and payment of new claims, including staff in investigations who work at local and regional headquarters level.  Some 200 of those staff work full-time on control work while the other 420 staff are responsible for both routine investigations relating to new claims and the reviews of customer claims.  Of the 200 inspectors, 89 are in the special investigation unit, the exclusive function of which is fraud prevention, detection and deterrence.  The Deputy will recall that in the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill before the summer recess, I sought and got from the Dáil additional powers relating to multi-agency investigations and co-operation.  We want to have a greater presence of social welfare inspectors on the street, as it were.  For example, next year we propose to increase significantly the number of visits to employers for the purpose of deterring black economy activity, where people in employment are not recorded as working.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Despite the apparent effort by the Department to beef-up the sector and to tackle this issue, the numbers do not seem to support this effort.  The number of staff, 620, is little different from the 600 in 2009 and the number of inspectors remains the same as it was in March.  The yield in savings is very similar to last year and we wonder if we will meet the target.  The Minister said that industrial action last year had curtailed the figure, but that has not been the case this year.  The review is not yielding the results we hoped it would.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	428	What is different is that we are targeting the use of the investigators.  In other words, they are targeting areas where there may be evidence to suggest there are problems.  This has been a particular feature of the work of the Department recently and I have stressed that this is important.  We have continued to conduct a huge number of reviews, which involves writing to people to check whether they are living at the address given and so on.  Most people are honest and, therefore, modern audits target the areas where there is reason to suspect there may be abuse.  That is where I would like to see the emphasis.  We are targeting for next year a significant increase in control savings, but we also want to target specifically areas where we have reason to believe there may be fraud.  Up to September, some 12,000 members of the public had made contact with the Department pointing out areas of abuse of the system.  They are not always right but it is interesting information.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	429	JobBridge, the national internship scheme, is part of the Government's job initiative and was launched on 1 July 2011.  As of last Friday, a total of 2,477 internship opportunities with host organisations were available on the website.  To date 1,769 interns have commenced an internship under the JobBridge scheme.  Of these, 625 individuals have converted their work placement programme placement into a JobBridge internship to avail of the €50 top-up.  In other words, some 1,100 people on internships had not been doing any other job placement or internship beforehand.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  JobBridge aims to offer individuals of all skill levels, ranging from those who left school early to highly qualified graduates and postgraduates, a unique opportunity to develop new skills and earn valuable experience.  JobBridge can offer a diverse range of jobseekers a chance that will at the very least improve their prospects of securing employment in future.Feedback on the scheme has revealed that there have been many excellent internships for non-graduates in the retail, catering and services sectors where participants are learning new skills, staying in touch with the labour market and putting themselves in a better position to get a full-time job.  Measures to minimise displacement include the following: all host organisations must declare in their application that they are not displacing an employee and that they have no vacancy in the specific area; the JobBridge team, part of the FÁS team in County Offaly, checks all applications against recent vacancies advertised on the FÁS Jobs Ireland website; and if the JobBridge team suspects that displacement may be an issue, it can liaise with regional FÁS management to find out more information on the company.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn order for all applications from host organisations to be approved they must also meet a number of criteria so as to ensure the potential internships are of sufficient quality.  These include the following: that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised; and that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.  In order for an internship to commence a standard internship agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation.  This agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.To ensure compliance with the scheme, my Department and the JobBridge team are monitoring internships to ensure that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and rules of the scheme.This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports which the host organisation uses to verify that the internship is proceeding as set out in the standard internship agreement.  In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns including random site visits will begin shortly as part of this process.The scheme also has a whistle blowing feature, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the national call centre.  All such claims will be investigated.  Where it is proven that displacement has occurred in a host organisation their internship opportunities will be removed and they will not be allowed to participate in JobBridge.

Has the Minister looked at the website?  She will see internships that clearly displace what should be real jobs and wages and exploit people.  Some of the internships include posts as retail assistants, car valets, catering assistants and general maintenance assistants.  The posts are dressed up in fancy language to give the impression they are meaningful internships but cursory research dispels that myth.  A retail assistant post based in Waterford city claims the intern "will also be trained in the use of highly specialized Microsoft RMS software, used for point of sale".  According to the Microsoft website, the RMS software package enables employees "to learn POS procedures in minutes", not 30 hours a week over nine months.Does the Minister agree she has failed to prevent displacement and exploitation that was an inevitable outworking of the scheme?  Does she agree that some employers are using the JobBridge scheme to avoid employing people on proper terms and conditions to undertake standard functions on which their businesses and profits to date depended?  Does she agree the design of the scheme facilitates this outrageous exploitation?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Over 4,000 employers have offered to host internships.  JobBridge is an internship and work experience programme, not a job.  Of those 4,000 employers, only 2,500 have had the request to host an internship accepted.  In some cases, more must be done because the specifications do not meet the requirements.  It is important to avoid displacement.  In the hotel and catering industry, Fáilte Ireland has done a detailed and valuable amount of work for the hospitality sector to identify good internships and what they do.Regarding what the Deputy describes as low-level jobs, someone who left school without many qualifications may be interested in a different kind of job and experience to someone who is a postgraduate archaeologist.  The Department and I made a decision to make JobBridge open to different levels and not to make it an internship open only to graduates and postgraduates.  It is open to a wide range of people.  Over 1,100 people have started internships and 625 people have transferred from the work placement programme.  Feedback is positive but that does not mean there are no problems and that we do not need constant vigilance.  I am sure it is providing a valuable experience to a significant number of people.

The practice to date seems to be that this is used as cheap or free labour.  Does the Minister agree the scheme is a giant disincentive to job creation?  Why would an employer create a real job when he or she can exploit free labour courtesy of this Government?  What steps will the Minister take to ensure the experience on JobBridge is meaningful and that the employee gets full training, not three hours in nine months?  This means training could be carried over to the next employment the employee will hopefully find.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	433	There are a series of monitoring processes, including the steering committee chaired by Mr. Martin Murphy, CEO of HP, which meets on a regular basis.  There is also a stakeholders' group and we take into account the advice of stakeholders, including employers' organisations and trade unions.  Internationally, there is recognition that a good quality internship is an opportunity for people who cannot get a job when there are very few jobs available.  They cannot get a job because they do not have experience and they cannot get experience because they cannot get a job.  The JobBridge was set up to get out of that catch-22.  The variety of internships on offer, bearing in mind that Deputy Ó Snodaigh may have thought this applied only to graduates——

The feedback is quite positive.  Many people are voluntarily monitoring for us.  There is a risk of displacement but the FÁS workers in the centre in Edenderry are doing work to make sure this aspect is dealt with at the beginning.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I am very aware of the very difficult financial position of some self-employed people.  However, there must be a balance between contributions made and benefits received.  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State contributory pension and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  Ordinary employees, who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker's benefit, pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full rate PRSI class A.  For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%.In this context, it may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money from social insurance compared to employees.  The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found that a self-employed contributor can expect to receive over ten times what he contributes, compared to an employee, who on average receives only three times what he and his employer contribute, despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.The contributory State pension increased at a greater rate than inflation or earnings growth in the period up to 2010, while annuities offer CPI-linked increases.  The market cost of an inflation-linked annuity with €12,000 a year in initial benefits is greater than €300,000, without any associated survivors' benefits.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAny changes to the PRSI system in order to provide access to short-term benefits such as jobseeker's benefit would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.I established the advisory group on tax and social welfare earlier this year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.  The group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  I look forward to receiving its report.The Deputy should be aware that self-employed persons may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments, including jobseeker's allowance.  In general, in assessing means, account will be taken of the level of earnings in the last 12 months in determining expected income for the following year.  In the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank the Minister for her response.  While it may be true that class S contributors receive more than ordinary employees, that is after they reach the age of 66 and retire.  There are a large number of self-employed people who, through no fault of their own in this recession, have ended up without work and dependent on social welfare and have been unable to avail of jobseeker's benefit.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to increasing the class S contribution rate to ensure there is a safety net.  This would be a labour activation measure as well as a way of encouraging people to set up their own businesses.  They can do so in the knowledge that there is a type of safety net they can avail of after an appropriate qualification period.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The Deputy's proposal that self-employed people be allowed to make full contributions at class A level is worth examining.  The advisory group on social welfare and taxation, which is currently examining the issue of family supports and child payments in the social welfare system, will next consider the issue of social welfare for the self-employed.  We are all aware that during the boom, the last thing on the minds of many people, particularly young men in the construction industry, was making large social insurance contributions, because it felt as though the boom would never end.  I am aware of what the Deputy is saying; many of those people have ended up in difficult circumstances.  If we want to have a proper welfare system, we must start designing the system so that the self-employed are included as well.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I ask all Deputies to keep their questions brief.  Deputy Pringle is not the worst offender, but we have to make some progress.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I welcome the fact that the Minister has asked for this to be examined and I look forward to seeing the outcome.  However, I ask the Minister to ensure, if she is agreeable to some sort of system being established, that it will not be voluntary.  There is a voluntary scheme under class P for share fishermen, but over the last ten years only 15 fishermen per year on average have availed of it.  Thus, it will have to be a compulsory scheme.  Overall, it would be for the greater good.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	441	If we want to build a modern welfare state for the 21st century, there are things we must take into account.  People who are leaving school today or leaving college this year or next year will spend some of their time as employees and some of their time as contractors or self-employed.  In some cases they will set up companies and become directors.  Our welfare system needs to make provision in the future for all those people.Obviously, people need to contribute so that the system is self-funding.  This year, there is a deficit in the social insurance fund of the order of €1.9 million, that is, the contributions have been less than what is being paid out because of the high level of unemployment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Rent supplement expenditure increased from €369 million in 2005 to €516 million in 2010.  The number of people claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 in 2005 to 95,700 as at October 2011, that is, by nearly 60%.  There are no plans to expand the scheme by relaxing the eligibility rules, thereby increasing the number of people in receipt of rent supplement.  The main strategic emphasis of policy initiatives undertaken by the Department over the last number of years is to return rent supplement to its original incarnation as a short-term income support for people who are renting and have lost their jobs but, in a better labour market, would probably find jobs within a year or so.Two main initiatives are currently being pursued by the Department to transfer long-term rent supplement recipients to housing solutions supported by local authorities.  These are the rental accommodation scheme, popularly known in Dublin as the RAS, and the new housing policy initiative launched in June of this year.The RAS, which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people who receive rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.  In June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing published a new housing policy framework statement.  The object, in terms of reform, is the transfer of the rent supplement scheme to local authorities.  One other feature of the rent supplement scheme is that it constitutes a welfare trap in certain cases, acting as a disincentive for people to return to work.  A multi-agency steering group involving my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is considering the implementation of this transfer.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThis will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment, while at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support payment for those who are temporarily unemployed.In line with commitments in the programme for Government, the Department is also working closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board to ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards. The Department is also working with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that landlords are tax-compliant.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I agree that the concept of transferring responsibility to the local authorities is to be welcomed, and I agree that the emphasis should be on the RAS, as has been the case in recent years.  There are 100,000 people on our housing waiting lists, which means there are almost 100,000 people on rent allowance.  The number on the housing list has risen to 56,000 since 2008.  The Minister mentioned some schemes announced by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  However, there is a dilemma with regard to social protection and the pressure to maintain social welfare rates as per the programme for Government, to which the Government re-committed  after 100 days in office.  Should the Government not seek to create schemes that would benefit the greatest number of people at a lesser cost to the taxpayer?  In this instance, such goals cannot be achieved through a large budget for rent allowance, but could be achieved through utilisation of the social dividend that NAMA owes to the taxpayers of this State.  Has there been some co-operation on this between the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing?  Has the Minister sought to advance the prospect of co-opting NAMA in order for the State to capitalise on what was promised initially as a social dividend?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	444	My colleague Deputy Penrose, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, has continual contact with NAMA with a view to obtaining this social dividend for citizens and taxpayers, who are paying the cost of NAMA, through the use of properties in the NAMA portfolio which may be suitable for housing.  The Minister of State has been active in pursuing this.One of the reasons the numbers on local authority housing lists have risen is that a person must register with the housing authority in order to receive rent supplement.  However, many of those receiving rent supplement are young and single.  There is a great deal of work to be done in terms of examining how the system of rent supplement has developed and expanded.  Some 95,000 people are currently in receipt of the supplement, amounting to a cost to the State of €500 million per year.  My Department is the largest purchaser of housing services from private landlords in the State.  As such, I agree that we could obtain better value for money.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	445	That is precisely why this issue should be pursued more vigorously than heretofore.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government today produced figures indicating that 19,000 houses are vacant and a further 17,000 are at various stages of construction.  That oversupply must be tackled vigorously and immediately in order to seek the dividend which could be demanded of NAMA for the State.  Such an approach would afford the Minister the leverage she needs to honour the commitments she and her party have given.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	446	Another priority in terms of saving money is for the Department to secure better deals from landlords in regard to rents.  That is best handled by the local authorities, which is why I am anxious to see the rent supplement scheme transferred to them.  Community welfare officers, who are experts in this area, joined my Department's staff on 1 October.  There is a committee of officials and people with expertise in the area between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  They are working closely together with a view to effecting the transfer of the scheme to the local authorities and initiating the new system in the new year.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I am very conscious of the needs of people on social welfare and fully understand that a wide range of groups depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  In the context of a very tough budgetary environment, I will do my utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society, including retired and older people in receipt of social welfare pensions and the free travel scheme.  My Department will spend more than €77 million in 2011 on the free travel scheme.  This will benefit more than 700,000 people, some 520,000 of whom are aged over 66.Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for maintaining an adequate system of social protection as well as for achieving future economic stability and growth.  For these reasons, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure and prioritise resources in my Department and all other Departments in 2012 and in later years.  In this regard, my Department has completed a comprehensive review of expenditure, the purpose of which is to assess the effectiveness and value for money of spending programmes across all Departments and agencies.  All spending lines are being examined without exception, and possible ways of reducing spending are being considered in every area of expenditure.  The fact that particular ways have been identified in which spending could potentially be reduced does not mean all of these approaches will be implemented.The intention behind the methodology being followed is to provide the Government with a set of decision options to enable it to meet three objectives.  These objectives are, first, to achieve overall fiscal consolidation outcomes, both as regards spending and numbers reduction targets; second, to re-align spending with programme for Government priorities; and, third, to consider new ways of implementing Government policy in the context of public sector reform.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn my discussions with my colleagues in Government I will have regard to any views expressed by the UN and by welfare representative organisations.  In this regard, I held a pre-budget forum on 16 September which was attended by 34 organisations.  I and my officials had the opportunity to listen carefully to their proposals relating to the next budget.  I stress that no decisions have been made to date in regard to welfare expenditure next year.  Those decisions will be made in due course after full consideration by the Government and will be announced on budget day.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	448	There can be no doubt that the Government's austerity measures have had the greatest impact on the more vulnerable members of society, including the elderly.  A new report published by researchers at UCD and St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, shows that more than 10,000 elderly people per year are subjected to some type of abuse, of which the most common is financial abuse.  Funding must be ring-fenced to protect the vulnerable members of society.  Such people, who include many of our older citizens, are already in extreme difficulty even before the inevitable further cutbacks are introduced.  We discussed the challenges facing the community and voluntary sector during Private Members' business this week.  Older people must be protected in the context of cutbacks in State spending and support for community initiatives.Will the Minister indicate whether there are there any plans to implement a fuel poverty strategy, as indicated in the programme for Government?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	449	The most effective means of ensuring people's homes are adequately heated is to install adequate insulation.  The Deputy will be aware that older people tend to live in older houses which may be poorly insulated.  It is important that we seek to have an active programme for insulating houses.  In the case of local authority houses built in the 1970s, for example, the insulation standards are very low.The Deputy should bear in mind that in the case of a pensioner couple where both people are aged over 66, the combined State contributory pension is €436, a significant increase since 2004.  In addition, the couple are entitled to household benefits and free travel.  That level of provision is the reason the ESRI found that elderly persons have for some years been at a lower risk of poverty, whether measured simply in terms of income or using measures of deprivation.  We should also bear in mind that the pensions and other payments older people receive are spent largely in this country.  It is important from an economic point of view that they should continue to have that level of purchasing power.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I agree that many older people have difficulty keeping their homes heated to a safe level.  I recently received information from a company called Wexford Viking Glass which installs glass in window frames without taking the frames out, offering an increase in insulation levels of 60%.  The company has proposed that the Government consider abolishing the VAT on its services in order to assist its business and promote efforts to improve insulation in older homes.  Taking out the entire window involves a great deal of labour in terms of re-plastering, re-painting and so on.  Replacing the glass only is a tidier job and much more cost effective.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The Deputy might send me a note with the details of the company's proposal.  A great deal of work is ongoing  in terms of insulation initiatives, many of which are carried out under community programmes in different areas throughout the State and have been very successful.  There is a challenge in that in the case of council houses built in the 1970s, for instance, some long-standing tenants still have their original windows.  I would be very interested in any proposals similar to that to which the Deputy referred, as would my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12 and 27 together.My Department will spend over €530 million in 2011 on the fuel scheme and the telephone, gas and electricity elements of the household benefits package which will benefit some 390,000 people on household benefits and 375,000 on the fuel allowance.  In 2005 there were 325,000 people on household benefits and 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of €280 million.  The costs have almost doubled in six years while the number of customers has risen by more than 20%.The fuel allowance is paid for 32 weeks, beginning on 26 September.  All customers will receive the standard rate of €20 per week, the rate previously received by the majority of customers, with no additional allowance for living in a smokeless area.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance were reduced from 2,400 to 1,800 with a view to generating savings of €17 million in 2011 and €65 million annually.The House should be aware that my Department will cover the cost of the price increases in electricity which came into effect from 1 October and maintain the value of these allowances at 1,800 units.  In other words, the price increases will not have an impact on the customers who benefit from this support.  The electricity allowance, which was €35.80 per month, will increase to €39.40.  The price increases recently announced will cost the Department over €4 million in 2011 and €17.3 million in a full year.I am aware that some of the reductions may affect some people but it is important to remember that with the plus 20% increase in energy prices the Department will fully cover people who have the fuel allowance for all of those price increases.  I am anxious that elderly people in particular would not be worried that the increases in fuel costs will not be covered by their allowance.  It will be absorbed by the Department at a cost of up to €17 million per year.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I thank the Minister for her detailed answer.  We know these cuts will start impinging greatly on the elderly.  The cuts in the benefits package for fuel allowance will reduce payments to pensioners and other social welfare recipients by €20 a month and up to €35 in the winter months.I welcome the Minister's comment that the price increase in electricity is to be absorbed by the Department and will not affect the household benefits package.  However, she also stated that the cost of that in the past five years alone has doubled which means the benefit to the providers has also doubled; the suppliers' incomes and profits have doubled.When these cuts came into effect some months ago we spoke about the Department's continued negotiations with the providers to get a discount and while that might be clouded by virtue of the increase not being passed on it should go even further.  There should be a discount to this State for the amount of funding being put into that sector and it is only right and proper that they come back to us with a recommendation in that regard.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I thank the Deputy for his support on this because the Department is a major purchaser of fuel in the sense of paying for people's fuel, electricity and gas bills but we do not get discounts.  The view was taken quite a long time ago by the Competition Authority that the Department did not have status in regard to negotiation.  We are currently negotiating it.  However, it may be necessary to put it out to tender and in that way achieve a reduction because given all of the reductions other businesses have made, it is more than appropriate that the big utility companies should recognise the difficulty of the economic position the country finds itself in, step up to the plate and offer saving measures to the Department.  It must be remembered that when we pay the fuel allowances, ESB bills and so on there is no bad debt experience.  The big utility companies are in the newspapers every other week regarding their difficulty with bad debts.  They do not experience that with the Department.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Three questions were tabled.  I will come back to Deputy Cowen.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Is it not the case that the cuts to the fuel allowance the Minister is proposing and the cuts she has already indicated to the household benefits package are the sharp edge of an obscene attack on the most vulnerable sectors of our society and that despite soothing words about covering the cost of electricity and gas price increases the reality of these cuts is a matter of life and death for people?  Is the Minister aware — I am sure she is — that there were 2,000 winter related deaths among elderly people, most of them pneumonia, colds and other winter related ailments?  Is it not a fact that these cuts mean more people will die?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	457	Thank you, Deputy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	458	How can that be justified when Ministers are earning €140,000 a year, gas company executives are earning €400,000 a year and ESB executives are earning €650,00 a year when we are talking about equality of pain?  None of them will die because of any increased taxes but elderly people may die as a result of these cuts.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Thank you, Deputy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I urge the Minister to reverse these cuts and any thought of imposing cuts on fuel allowance.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Other Deputies wish to ask questions.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The Deputy would be aware that in addition to the household benefits package and the fuel allowance, we have 1,000 community welfare officers employed whose job is to assist people who may have exceptional needs in regard to fuel payments.  We employ 1,000 people to do that at very significant cost to the taxpayer and it surprises me that the Deputy would not acknowledge the work the community welfare officers do to assist very vulnerable people who may have exceptional needs.If an elderly person has an illness such as pneumonia and is hospitalised I would seriously hope that a Deputy like Deputy Boyd Barrett would be aware of the work of the community welfare officers at local level because in the event of anybody who is dependent on social welfare becoming very ill it might be that they would need additional assistance in respect of fuel.  As I stated earlier, however, the best way we can all help older people is to ensure that their houses are better insulated because many older people's houses suffer extreme heat loss.  In addition, the utility companies should be giving us a discount.  Eircom did that in that it no longer charges for the rental of the telephone.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	463	A Cheann Comhairle——
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	464	No, Deputy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Come on.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Deputy Ó Snodaigh tabled a question.  He is perfectly entitled to ask a question.  We have very limited time.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I wish to ask two brief questions.  First, given that this is a life and death issue — nearly 2,000 people died from cold last year — would the Minister not agree that before any cut was contemplated in the fuel allowance and the household benefits package the discount route should have been rigorously pursued?  Second, is the Minister aware that a realisable discount of only 14% is all that is needed to cover the cost?  That is realisable and it should have been the first route before any cut came in or was even contemplated.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I very much share the Deputy's sentiments.  I was in a particular difficulty in that a number of measures or savings in 2011 and future years were specified as part of budget 2011 but were not announced by the then Fianna Fáil Government at the time.  They were specified and laid down when I came into office.  They included a saving of €30 million in the energy and telephone elements of the household benefits package in 2011 and subsequent years.  The specific way in which the saving was to be made was not specified.  They also included the abolition of the smokeless fuel allowance with a saving of €7.7 million in 2011 and €17.5 million in subsequent years.The numbers receiving fuel allowances are greater this year than was foreseen by Fianna Fáil when in Government last year.  In addition, fuel prices have risen by 22%.  I believe the discount route is the appropriate route to take.  We may have to take other action because of legal difficulties but I have been working continuously on this issue.  Eircom has given us some discount, by no longer charging the Department €2 per month in perpetuity for the rent of the telephone.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Will the Minister reverse the cuts if the Department gets the discount?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I am running out of time.  I want three brief questions from Deputies Cowen, Boyd Barrett and Ó Snodaigh.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Minister said that the Competition Authority had problems with the issue of discounting.  She repeated that there were legal difficulties in pursuing it.  What had the Competition Authority to say about Eircom's acquiescence to the State's request?  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, and I said it earlier, we asked the Minister to pursue this line some months ago and we want to see results in order to alleviate the threats that elderly people experience by virtue of these cuts.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	472	How can the Minister use the work of community welfare officers as a smokescreen for the substantial question that is being asked of her?  If we have already had 2,000 winter related deaths, is it because the funds to procure fuel and electricity to provide warmth for elderly and vulnerable citizens are inadequate?  Many of them would not have the confidence, knowledge or ability to contact a community welfare officer.  The reality is that an unacceptable situation is now going to be made worse because of cuts to fuel allowance and household benefits package.  More elderly and vulnerable people will die if we continue to cut the fuel allowance and other vital allowance for electricity and gas.  That is not acceptable and I do not know how the Minister can justify it.  Surely we can look to the well paid and the wealthy to bear this burden instead of putting it on the most vulnerable and elderly sections of our society where it will result in deaths.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I welcome the Minister's answer.  Will she  reverse the cuts if she achieves the discount?  Will she change the law if there is a problem from the Competition Authority to allow the discount route to be pursued?  We on this side of the House will support any measure that ensures that Government spending is effective and efficient and that the Department can gain the same benefits that other purchasers gain.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	474	On the energy side, the negotiations with the ESB are continuing.  There were difficulties with the Competition Authority for a number of years.  The core of the difficulty is that the Department is not recognised as a bulk purchaser.  The contract for fuel supplies is deemed to be between the individual social welfare client, the pensioner or whoever, and the energy company.  If a view is taken that we are bulk purchasers and that we pay in bulk, there is the possibility of a discount.  In regard to the charge for the telephone, it is a charge for an actual appliance but I am very grateful that Eircom recognised our argument.  The legal route to avail of a discount may be to put the benefits out to tender and have a tender price that is negotiated downwards.  If there is a benefit from that, it will be reflected ultimately in a better quality of service.I wish to stress to Deputy Boyd Barrett that throughout the country, particularly in older local authority housing estates, insulating older houses and farm properties saves money and improves the quality of life.  That is the reason that in the Jobs Initiative, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte has emphasised this.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	475	We all agree with that idea but it does not justify the cuts.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	476	It is the most important thing that we should do but it will take time.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	477	Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for maintaining an adequate system of social protection as well as achieving future economic stability and growth.  For these reasons, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in my Department and in all other Departments, in 2012 and in later years.  All Departments are aware that the Government has to bring forward major savings across the full range of public expenditure and to prioritise resources very carefully.  The purpose of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure is to assess the effectiveness and value for money of spending programmes across all Departments and agencies.The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department in the years ahead will be considered in the context of budget 2012 and subsequent budgets.  All considerations will be informed by the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates and by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  My Department has forwarded preliminary savings options to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  My officials continue to engage with the Department on the options outlined in the review, with a view to preparing material for the Economic Management Council and the Government.All decisions arising from the review will be decided in the final instance by Government.  As is the norm during the initial stage of the budgetary process, details will not be released in advance of Government decisions.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Howlin, has already indicated that he intends to publish the reports submitted as part of the review process following the finalisation of the budgetary process later this year.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I thank the Minister for her reply.  I am glad to see that she remains consistent in this regard, in spite of repeated questions from myself and others throughout the course of the year.  The problem is that the Tánaiste is also consistent.One hears members of the Government refer to the Memorandum of Understanding.  Some are set in stone and some are not.  The agreement was made against the background of the necessary austerity that was required because of the interest rate that was struck at that time, but subsequently the interest rate has been reduced, not necessarily by design, by accident.  The savings the State will make on foot of the interest rate reduction have been bandied about as €1 billion per annum.  In the discussions of our finance spokesperson with the troika, it was stated that any austerity measures should not impinge on the less well off or those most in need.Meetings are taking place this week with the relevant authorities and the troika.  Could the Minister have asked those who are negotiating on our behalf to secure a condition from the troika that due to the savings, there is wriggle room for the Minister to honour the commitments that she and her partners in Government made?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The most effective way of reducing the cost of social welfare expenditure is to get people back to work.  The difficulty that the budget labours under is that when the then Government made the forecasts this time last year and signed off on the Memorandum of Understanding, it estimated a higher growth rate but more importantly from the point of view of the Department, that only 405000 people would be unemployed, whereas unemployment figures are higher and are running at 45,000 ahead of what was estimated.  To try to reduce expenditure we have to focus on getting people back to work, something I have emphasised.The IMF, because of its experience in other countries, is very conscious of the role played by social expenditure and social welfare expenditure in demand in domestic economies.  Therefore, it has emphasised its understanding of that.  The ECB, as part of the troika, is very interested in seeing moneys it has set aside for Ireland being secured as quickly as possible.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The Department of Social Protection offers every alternative option and support system to people to get them back to work, the area which is relevant.  There were outlandish predictions made by the Minister's partners in government allied to the NewERA project and the number of jobs it was going to create.  It has become more realistic in recent months.  Funding for it is up in the air.  If the proposed sale of assets is to yield funds will they be used for NewERA or to pay the debt?  I ask the same question in regard to rate reduction.  This week's negotiations could yield a dividend for the State of by virtue of job creation and the rates which the Minister and Government have continuously asked to supplement.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	481	In the regard to the memorandum of understanding and the deal with the troika we have to balance two concerns.  We have been doing well.  We were told renegotiation of the interest rate was impossible by Fianna Fáil when it was in government.  I predicted it could be done and it has been done.  We now need to negotiate the structure of the promissory note to Anglo Irish Bank which totals €3 billion a year plus interest of, I understand, 8%.  It is very expensive for us as a country.The troika, in particular the IMF, was conscious that the best way of meeting targets is to have growth and job creation in the economy.  Every person who returns to work comes off social welfare and starts to pay income tax, as well as beginning to spend money.  It is probably worth between €15,000 and €20,000 to the economy.  It is important that we pursue a twin track strategy and deal with the debt and deficit, as well as getting people back to work.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I presume, based on the Minister's comments, rent supplement and RAS have been identified as part of her Department's budget cuts under the spending review.  Would the Minister agree transferring people from the rent supplement scheme to RAS is like moving the deck chairs on the Titanic?Has any consideration being given to front-loading rent supplement to local authorities, along with asking the Minister for Finance or NAMA to transfer properties?  Such a change would allow local authorities to get people off rent supplement and the RAS scheme, which would result in longer term savings.  It would be a more sustainable review of spending than an overnight cut which has been contemplated.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I gave my view earlier.  Rent supplement should be transferred to local authorities.  It was meant as a temporary housing support for people in rented accommodation who lost their jobs.  It has become a permanent feature of the system, encompassing 95,000 people and costing approximately €500 million this year.  The other major problem with rent supplement is that it can constitute a severe employment trap, particularly for a couple with two or more children.  To rent a house for such a family in many Dublin areas would cost €1,000.  Somebody moving to work from rent supplement could lose €12,000 a year, whereas if he or she was on a local authority differential rent he or she would be able to predict roughly the level of rent proportional to his or her income.  It is an important reason to reform the system and move it from social welfare to local authorities.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The back to education allowance, BTEA, scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.The number of participants engaged with BTEA has grown steadily in recent years.  In the 2010-11 academic year there were 25,032 participants, an increase of 20.3% on the previous year, which comprised 20,808 participants.  The 2009-10 academic year saw a dramatic increase of 79% on the previous year.  As of 30 September 2011, there were 18,440 participants availing of the scheme.  Final figures for the current academic year are not yet available as claims are still being processed.  However, it is expected that participation levels will increase this year.  Significant resources have been devoted to BTEA.  Some €519 million has been allocated over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2007-13.  The budget for BTEA in 2011 is €198.8 million, which represents over 10% of an increase on 2010 expenditure.A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy certain conditions, such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications, among others.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn general, a BTEA applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age or 24 years for postgraduate courses, prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of jobseeker's payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least two years.  An age criterion is necessary as BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the education system.A waiting period prior to entitlement is considered essential to enable people to engage in job search and consider options available to them.  BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an extended period and a waiting period avoids establishing a pull factor to the live register for the purpose of accessing schemes of this nature.  The qualifying period for the second level option is three months in recognition of the need for more urgent intervention for this cohort, while the qualifying period for third level courses is nine months having been reduced from 12 months only last year.  A person awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established.State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one and BTEA mirrors this fundamental principle which is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur.  With effect from 19th July 2010, changes were introduced to the qualifying conditions of the scheme to reflect a deteriorating economic situation which built on other enhancements made to the scheme in recent years.  Changes included allowing BTEA in cases where applicants were resuming studies having previously dropped out, had been granted exemptions for previous studies and allowing courses started on a part time basis to be completed full time under BTEA.The BTEA is an administrative scheme and scheme guidelines are evaluated on a continuous basis to ensure scarce resources remain focused on those with the greatest need who are furthest from the labour market.  The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure it continues to meet its objectives.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I thank the Minister for the detailed response.  I acknowledge an increase was given this year by the previous Government.  There has been an increase in applications which is to be welcomed and expected, given the predicament in which we find ourselves.  It is something we have to promote and improve.Education is one of the primary ways out of the situation in which those whom we represent find themselves.  I ask the Minister to be open to suggestions from all Deputies on gaps in the current scheme.  Some people cannot access it through no fault of their own.  Some people have returned from abroad and wish to avail of opportunities to further their education in order to make themselves more accessible to the employment market.There is a grey area in the adjudication system on one moving a grade above what one has already achieved.  I ask the Minister to allow us to make suggestions in that regard.  I know of a woman who has a primary degree, a higher diploma and a masters degree.  She wished to study a further higher diploma to avail of a teaching opportunity but unfortunately could not access a grant.  If she wants to pursue further study it will be at great cost to her.  In these times such people are the very ones we have to congratulate and help.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The short answer is that it is a fundamental rule that educational progression is upwards.  As the Deputy probably knows, many people availing of the BTEA are returning to second level education because they did not complete it.  If somebody has already completed a high level of education such as a masters degree it is difficult to deprive someone in second level who is completing his or her education of funding.  A number of Deputies have raised this issue.  In the current financial situation it is difficult to find extra resources to allow people to step back in terms of qualification.  I am certainly open to a more detailed discussion on this with the committee or to bringing in some people who are qualified to comment on this.  The back to education allowance, which we are spending €200 million on, is money that is well worth spending.  The best chance of getting a job as the recession starts to lift is to have appropriate qualifications.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I thank the Minister and take on board her suggestion about bringing this to the attention of the relevant committee.  We must recognise, and many young people do recognise, that despite the level of qualifications they may have achieved in these straitened times, there is a need to go beyond that.  They must be complimented on that and rewarded in whatever way we can.  To that end, I expect we will bring this to the attention of the committee and seek ways and means to support everyone who wishes to improve their education, be it at second or third level or beyond even a primary degree.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I have had a lot of calls about this.  A simple criterion should apply; if someone wants to go back to education or to further their education, he should not be put in a position where he must stay on the dole for another six months before qualifying.  It is an extraordinary situation.  One young woman approached me recently.  She decided not to sign on after having been away because she did not want to be a drain on the State.  She was forced to sign on somewhat later and was subsequently refused the back to education allowance because she had not signed on earlier.  When she put it to the social welfare office that she had not signed on because she did not want to do so unnecessarily and be a drain on the State, she was told she should have signed on, been a drain on the State and she would then have qualified.  It is crazy.  If people show the energy and dynamism of wanting to improve their education and not be forced into dependency on social welfare, we must deal with the anomalies that would people in that position and I would urge the Minister to do that.

That is a problem because we are then asking those people to spend another 12 months on the dole.  Can that nine month figure be reduced to five months or can the criteria be totally changed so a full assessment is done?Many people have achieved level 8, the highest a person can go, and were previously employed but now need to do another level 8 course but they are not allowed to do an equivalent.  They are not going higher, they are changing tack, particularly those who have been in employment for a long time.  Those aged 40 or 50, or even younger, who wish to transfer to a totally different career should be able to achieve the equivalent level.

The qualifying period for the second level option is three months.  Those who become unemployed in February face a problem but it takes people a while to identify the courses they want to do.  It is a principle of the scheme that there should be upward progression, although I recognise that where someone wants to change career, there may be a reason to look at it.  We should bear in mind, however, that the previous period for third level courses was 12 months but has now been reduced to nine.  I will gladly keep the matter under review but being honest, the financial leeway I have in a budgetary context is limited and I must ensure we keep within spending limits.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.In 2010, total overpayments amounted to €83.4 million representing 0.41% of total Departmental expenditure. Overpayments arising from suspected fraudulent activity amounted to less than 0.1% of total Departmental expenditure in 2010.   It is important to emphasise, therefore, that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them each week, a point that tends to be lost in some of the media reports around this issue.There are essentially 3 elements to the work of the Department namely income support payments, activation support and services, and control of fraud and abuse.  It is vital that a balance is maintained between these 3 elements and that any initiatives in the control area take full account of income poverty.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the Department processes in excess of 2 million applications each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people each week.  I want to emphasise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.  I therefore agree with the Deputy that issues in relation to fraud and abuse should always be reported in a fair and balanced way.The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  As the Deputies may be aware, I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure that public confidence in the system is improved.Those customers who are aware that they are being, or have been, overpaid by the Department should contact their local social welfare office without delay.  An overpayment recovery plan, acceptable both to the customer and to the Department, will then be agreed.  I therefore have no plans to introduce an amnesty for customers as suggested by the Deputy as I do not consider this to be an appropriate response.  The Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments arising as a result of suspected fraud or error. Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.Most social welfare customers fully declare their means and circumstances and, therefore, do not receive more than their entitlements. From an equity perspective, it is also important that the Department seeks to recover overpayments where they occur. An overpayment debt will remain on the customer's records until fully recovered. This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension. Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining.

The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general.Significant achievements over the last couple of years include:procurement of a complete managed service for the production, maintenance and distribution of the card,construction of a secure card personalisation and distribution centre in Bray Co. Wicklow. A specimen card was personalised on this site on 8th December, 2010,finalisation of card design and technical specifications anddevelopment of structures and processes and a technical infrastructure within the Department to support client registration as well as the management and administration of the cards.The phased introduction of the Public Services Card started this month.  The registration process is currently being piloted in a number of local offices in the Department, including Tullamore, Sligo and King's Inn in Dublin.  It is anticipated that up to 4,000 people will be issued with cards by end of year. Roll out of the card will be done as securely and speedily as possible but it will take a number of years to complete. The initial focus will be on roll out to Department clients of working age.The front of the card shows a person's name, photograph and signature, along with the card expiry date.  The back of the card shows the person's PPS Number and a card number.  It also has a magnetic stripe for compatibility with existing Social Services Cards.  The card will electronically hold a person's name, PPS Number, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality, all former surnames, all former surnames of their mother, a photograph and a signature.  The principle is that the card only holds identifying data and that any other sensitive data relating to a particular use would be held on a secure server in the relevant agency.  Each card will also hold data relating to its own issue (e.g. card number) and security (e.g. to check it is being read by an authorised device).

Overall, appeals increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010.  However, at 30 September 2011 the number of appeals received since the beginning of the year is 2,172 less than the numbers received in the same period in 2010.  In April of this year the Department appointed 9 additional Appeals Officers who augmented the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010 and brought the total number of appeals officers serving in the Office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired appeals officers, equating to a further 3 full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.  In that regard  some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring-fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced appeals officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.   This project commenced on July 1st.  Also, some 70% of appeals cases are now decided by way of summary decision which because of the logistics involved in organizing oral hearings, greatly reduces the overall processing times.As a result of the various initiatives taken, 18,236 decisions were made by appeals officers in the first nine months of 2011, in comparison to 12,692 for the same period in 2010 and the backlog of cases awaiting determination has reduced from 20,274 at the beginning of the year to 17,651 at 30th September 2011.YearAppeals20083,73320098,13020106,4692011*—2,172*Figures as at 30 September 2011 as compared to the position at September 2010

The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.As previously indicated to the House, since May 2008, some 900 staff have been assigned across the Department to fill critical vacancies and additional posts allocated to deal with the increased volume of claims.  Processing times vary across schemes because of the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria. For example, means assessments are required for all social assistance schemes, medical examinations are required for some of the illness related schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence conditions. In the case of insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.With regard to the particular schemes referenced by the Deputy, I would advise that the Department is involved in a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications for its carer's allowance, invalidity and disability pensions, amongst other schemes.  The project involves the development of new IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.The invalidity pension scheme is fully operational on the new system since May 2011 with most claims now being desk assessed by medical assessors to determine medical suitability.  All new carer's allowance claims are being processed on the new IT system since August 2011.  The next phase of the project involves the migration of the existing claims, and this is currently planned for the second quarter of 2012.In relation to the disability allowance scheme there has been a significant increase in the number of claims being desk assessed thus reducing the number of cases being referred for investigation by social welfare inspectors.  In addition, since August 2009 all claims for disability allowance are being desk assessed by the medical assessors thus obviating the need to call claimants for in-person medical examinations. Since November 2010, all medical reports for new disability allowance claims are being scanned which facilitates easier access by more medical assessors.  A project was commenced in July 2011 to provide for the processing of disability allowance claims on the new IT system.  It is expected that the first batch of new claims will be dealt with in the first quarter of 2012.The modernisation project is being given high priority and requires a significant level of time and commitment from staff in the scheme areas involved in the project.  This necessary diversion of resources has resulted in a negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue in the short-term until the projects are fully implemented and the backlogs can be cleared.  As an interim measure overtime and additional temporary staff have been deployed to assist with clearing the backlogs.   Also, resources from within the Carer's Allowance section have been deployed to deal with the backlog of appeals cases on hands for submission to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.While every effort is made to decide on entitlement in a timely manner, there are cases where delays will necessarily be experienced.  In situations where customers find themselves suffering financial hardship while awaiting the outcome of a claim, the facility to receive supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) is provided for.  More than 95% of basic SWA applications are decided and paid within a week.  I am very pleased to inform the House that the Community Welfare Service (CWS) transferred from the HSE to my Department on 1st October 2011.  The integration of the service will bring about further enhanced, more streamlined service delivery to our customers.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Carer's benefit is a payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and are planning to leave or have recently left the workforce to care for somebody who needs full-time care and attention. It  is paid for two years for each person cared for and can be claimed in a single continuous period or in separate periods adding up to a total of two years. The scheme operates in conjunction with the Carer's Leave Act, 2001 which ensures the protection of the person's employment rights during an absence on Carer's Leave.The scheme is particularly targeted at those people who have to leave paid employment to care. In addition to the conditions regarding full-time care, there are two main qualifying conditions in relation to employment and PRSI contributions which must be satisfied in order to qualify for the scheme. These qualifying conditions are in place to ensure that recipients of the scheme have a reasonable recent attachment to the workforce.The first condition is that the person must have been employed for at least 16 hours per week for 8 weeks in the 26 week period immediately before claiming carer's benefit. Persons who have been on maternity, annual, adoptive, parental or term-time leave immediately prior to becoming a carer are eligible for carer's benefit.  The leave period is disregarded so that the 26 week period to be assessed (to find 8 weeks of remunerative full-time insurable employment, whether consecutive or not) is the period prior to that leave.Secondly the person must satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions. For carer's benefit only paid contributions are counted when determining eligibility for the scheme. The carer must have 156 PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and either 39 contributions in the relevant tax year or 39 contributions paid in the 12 months immediately before the commencement of the carer's benefit claim or 26 contributions paid in the ‘relevant tax year' and 26 contributions paid in the tax year prior to that. The ‘relevant tax year' is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the benefit is claimed; for claims made in 2011, the relevant tax year is 2009.While it is the case that credited contributions accrued on maternity leave do not count towards the PRSI contribution condition for carer's benefit, the period of this leave is disregarded for the purposes of the employment condition.  A person will be awarded credits while in receipt of carer's benefit in order to protect their social insurance record and these credits may help them to qualify for future social welfare payments.A person who is not entitled to carer's benefit can apply for carer's allowance which is a means-tested payment for people looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. A person caring on a full-time basis can also apply for a respite care grant which is an annual payment of €1,700 made regardless of the carer's means.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The elimination of poverty is a key objective of Government and the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPSincl) includes a target to reduce the number of people experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. Consistent poverty is the Government's official measure of poverty. People are in consistent poverty if their household income is below 60% of median income (at-risk-of poverty) and they are living in a household experiencing two or more items of basic deprivation, out of an 11 item list.The NAPSincl target is reiterated in the National Reform Programme 2010, which sets out Ireland's commitments to achieving the poverty target in the Europe 2020 Strategy.    The Department has overall responsibility in relation to monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the NAPSincl. This involves monitoring poverty trends based on the annual CSO Survey of Income and Living Standards (SILC), a periodic progress report on the detailed actions in the plan and the report on stakeholders' views articulated at the annual Social Inclusion Forum.The most recently published SILC data in this area relates to 2009 and it is expected that 2010 SILC data will be available later this year. The 2009 data shows that the challenge to meet the national poverty target in the present economic situation is considerable, as indicated by the rise in the consistent poverty rate from 4.2 per cent in 2008 to 5.5 per cent in 2009. Analysis of the SILC 2009 data suggests that the increase in consistent poverty appears to be driven by an increase in the deprivation element of the measure while the relative income element appears to be largely unchanged.Arising out of the deliberations in drawing up the National Reform Programme, the Government decided to undertake a comprehensive review of the national poverty target, as proposed in the Memorandum for Government on Ireland's National Reform Programme under the Europe 2020 Strategy. The purpose of the review is to enable the Government to adopt appropriate and achievable national poverty targets to meet Ireland's contribution to Europe 2020 and the commitments in the Programme for Government. The review is to be completed by November 2011.Notwithstanding this review, the overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment and build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. The Government Programme sets out the framework to achieve these aims. Employment opportunities will be increased through labour market activation, skills training and education measures. The Government is committed to ensuring that the social protection system remains an important stabiliser for people against the impact of the economic and fiscal downturn.Tackling child poverty is a priority for the Government and a key goal of NAPSincl. Four-fifths of those in consistent poverty are found in households with children and 8.7 per cent of children (96,000 in absolute numbers) were in consistent poverty in 2009.  Factors contributing to childhood poverty include living in lone parent households, labour market inactivity, low educational attainment and living in households dependent on income support.Government targets in the area of financial support for low-income families continue to be met. One of the high level goals relating to children in NAPsincl is to maintain the combined value of child income support measures at 33-35 per cent of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate over the course of the plan. The value of the combined child income supports measures (child benefit plus qualified child increases) in both Budget 2010 and Budget 2011 was equivalent to 33 per cent of the main working age payment rates.

Those who qualify are normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.    Examples of the main types of needs that are met under this provision are:assistance towards the purchase of household appliances, bedding, clothing & child related items such as cots and prams,household repair and maintenance,rent deposits,funeral & burial expenses,travel costs,financial hardship such as lost/stolen money.The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be ‘exceptional'. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice. The use of ENPs and every such decision must be based on the careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP).  In certain circumstances, this payment can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA. Examples of situations where such assistance may be provided would be in the aftermath of flooding or a domestic fire where the immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter, of the people affected may be met by a UNP in cash or in kind.A working group in the Department is currently undertaking a complete review of the exceptional needs and urgent needs payments which should be completed shortly. Arising from this review the Department expects to produce and publish guidelines for staff dealing with such payments.

However, during their JobBridge internship, interns will not receive additional benefits, such as fuel allowance, if they were previously not entitled to this benefit before they began their internship.  This means that by participating in JobBridge, an individual will not lose an existing entitlement, such as fuel allowance, provided they were already entitled to it before commencing their internship.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	500	In order to be eligible to participate in JobBridge the National Internship Scheme, an individual must:currently be in receipt of a live claim (Jobseeker's Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/Signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits) on the Live Register;have been in receipt of Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance or signing for Social Insurance Contribution Credits for a total of 78 days or more in the last 6 months.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, one of the key objectives of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent their drift into long-term unemployment.  For these reasons, the eligibility for the JobBridge scheme is confined to those on the Live Register.The policy objective for this scheme is to concentrate on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in exchequer costs over time.  Individuals in receipt of One Parent Family Payment may access a wide range of activation supports including the FÁS Work Placement Programme, which is designed to provide participants with valuable work experience, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.  Part-time fire-fighters are entitled to a jobseeker's payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  In this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat them differently to any other jobseeker's benefit or allowance claimant.In applying the legislation, Deciding Officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, as well as the age, educational qualifications and family circumstances of the particular claimant.  Regard is also had to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities in their locality.The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified.  It is a principle of the availability for work condition that a person's unemployment must be involuntary and it is not possible for an unemployed person to hold herself or himself available exclusively for employment that is within a restricted distance from a fire station where he or she is employed as a part-time fireperson.  Such action would be taken as placing an unreasonable restriction on his or her availability to secure full-time employment.While the importance of retained fire brigade personnel is fully recognised, the introduction of special arrangements exempting them from the requirement to fulfil the statutory conditions for entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or allowance would raise equity issues vis-a-vis other claimants to jobseeker's payments.  However, taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise our jobseeker schemes, a group has been established in the Department to examine the position of part-time fire-fighters.  This group will report to me over the coming period.

These include the following:that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised; andthat the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.In order for an internship to commence a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.  To ensure compliance with the scheme, my Department and the JobBridge team are monitoring internships to ensure that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports which the host organisation uses to verify that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement.  In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns including random site visits will begin shortly as part of this process.The scheme also has a ‘whistle blowing' feature, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the National Call Centre.  All such claims will be investigated.  Where it is proven that displacement has occurred in a Host Organisation their internship opportunities will be removed and they will not be allowed to participate in JobBridge.

This is a prerequisite to maintaining an adequate system of social protection as well as achieving future economic stability and growth.Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure and prioritise resources in my Department and in all other Departments, in 2012 and in later years.  However, I am very conscious of the needs of people who currently rely on Social Welfare, including those avail, or may in the future avail, of the back to work and back to education schemes.

I met representatives of the partnership when they made a submission on its work at my Department's pre-budget forum on 16th September.  In addition, my Department and the partnership jointly participated in an EU peer review on the use of minimum essential budgets for drawing up the requirements of a minimum income scheme and assessing adequacy in 2010, a report on which is available on the EU peer review website.I understand that the partnership will in due course update its analysis of minimum essential budgets to take account of budgetary changes and adjustments in the cost of living.  I look forward to receiving this updated analysis.My department undertook an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts on families of the Budget 2011 tax and welfare package, in conjunction with the Department of Finance.  I arranged for this to be published on the department's website in March 2011.  It is my intention that a similar analysis of Budget 2012 will be published early next year.As part of the deliberative process for Budget 2012, my department will analyse, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes prior to the finalisation of the Budget.  Due to the requirements of the budgetary process, it will not be possible to publish this material prior to the finalisation of the Budget and the associated Dáil votes.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 30 and 31 together.There are several commitments contained in the Programme for Government in relation to the rent supplement scheme including removing barriers to employment.  The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of people claiming rent supplement.  In this regard the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing & Planning on the 16th June 2011 announced a new housing policy framework statement reflecting the content of the Programme for Government (Government for National Recovery 2011-2016) and setting out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term.  This policy framework statement contained an announcement in relation to the transfer of responsibility for providing for the housing needs of long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis.This transfer of tenants from rent supplement to the local authorities will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and return rent supplement to its original intention of a short-term income support payment.  A steering group has been established by Minister Penrose to oversee the development of the project and a number of working groups have been established to address the wide range of complex issues arising.  Subject to the successful conclusion of the work of the steering group, it is the intention to bring proposals to Government later in 2011.  A date to begin implementing the new arrangements can then be formally agreed.  There are no plans to transfer staff from the Department to the local authorities.No discussions have taken place between the Department and the National Assets Management Agency on using their properties to reduce expenditure on rent supplement.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs and the Department does not source/rent properties on behalf of tenants.  If the Department were to rent properties directly from the National Assets Management Agency or any other major landlord then it would significantly change the administration and operation of the rent supplement scheme.  A change such as this would incur additional obligations and responsibilities on the Department and would lead to rent supplement becoming a housing solution rather than an income support payment as it is currently intended.However, I understand that discussions have taken place with NAMA and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to utilising NAMA properties to provide such housing solutions.  I can confirm that where a claimant's safety and well-being are at risk, staff in the Department have been provided with special discretionary powers to make a payment to meet the person's accommodation need.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The focus of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.  The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people in receipt of certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.Progression has always been a fundamental condition of BTEA.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  It should be noted that, in the 2010/2011 academic year, of the 25,032 participants supported through BTEA, 43% pursued second level courses.  Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseeker's payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.On May 10th, as part of the Government's Jobs Initiative, 20,900 new and additional places were announced in training, education and work experience programmes.  As part of this initiative, a new fund, entitled Springboard, which is being managed by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provides education and training opportunities to support unemployed people.  The primary objective of Springboard is to help unemployed people to remain as close as possible to the labour market by accessing part-time flexible higher education and training opportunities to upskill or reskill in areas where sustainable employment opportunities may arise as the economy recovers.The target group for this programme of over 200 courses includes unemployed people with a previous history of employment who already hold a higher level qualification at NFQ Levels 6 to 9, who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling in order to re-enter employment.  By way of the part-time education option, unemployed people on jobseekers' payments will be facilitated in retaining their payment, subject to continuing entitlement, within the broader back to education framework.FÁS, as the National Training Authority, anticipates the needs of, and responds to, a constantly changing labour market.  It strives to do this through the provision of tailored training programmes that suit various needs.  Access to many training programmes is not determined by a person's welfare status.  Through a regional network of 66 offices and 20 training centres, FÁS operates these training programmes including some in co-operation with community, voluntary and statutory organisations.  Further information is available locally at these FÁS offices.  The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

I have made inquiries with the Registrar General and he has informed me that the general review of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004 is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  The intention is to bring forward legislative proposals in 2012 based on this review.There are a range of issues to be considered in relation to the scope and implementation of any proposed changes to the provisions of the Act and some of these issues have cross-departmental implications, which need to be considered also.  One of the main priorities of the review is to examine possible legislative solutions to the issue of marriages of convenience and consultations with other departments in relation to this and other issues are ongoing.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I am aware of the proposals made by Social Justice Ireland and the key features that would underpin the operation of such an initiative.  I have some concerns about this proposal relating to the displacement effects and other distortions that might be caused to an already difficult labour market, including the longer term sustainability of the sector and volunteering.  In addition, based on experience with the operation of a number of community and work placements initiatives, my Department is not convinced that the capacity exists to provide meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities within the sectors referred to in the proposal.The Department currently operates a number of initiatives that use a similar model to that proposed.  These include community employment, the rural social scheme, job initiative, Tús and the community services programme.  Together, these initiatives will support over 35,000 people in work placements under various initiatives by the end of 2011.  These are in addition to the JobBridge initiative which launched during the summer as part of the Government's Jobs Initiative and which aims to supports 5,000 people in internships.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	510	My Government remains highly concerned about the situation in Bahrain, and the recent sentencing of 20 medical professionals, a number of whom were either trained by or have worked with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), to sentences ranging from five to fifteen years.  Ireland raised the situation in Bahrain at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 10 October where we made clear our concerns and urged continued attention on the part of the EU to persuade the Bahrain authorities to rescind these harsh sentences and engage in meaningful national dialogue and reform. We also expressed appreciation for HR Ashton's efforts and for her strong statement of 30 September criticising the sentencing which she had made in response to requests from a number of Member States, including Ireland. Ireland's concerns were shared by HR Ashton and a number of other partners and there was broad agreement that the EU should remain actively engaged on this issue and the general human rights situation in Bahrain.At the bilateral level, I have already requested our Ambassador in Saudi Arabia, accredited to Bahrain, to convey our concerns directly to the Bahraini authorities. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the US Administration have also issued critical statements on the sentencing which I believe have been influential and timely.There is some evidence that the concerted international pressure is having an impact, not least in the decision on 5 October to order retrials in civilian courts of the 20 medical professionals, a step in the right direction which I obviously welcome. I also believe that the situation in Bahrain can be positively impacted by the work of the Independent International Commission into last Spring's events whose final report should issue in the coming weeks. I hope that this report, once issued, can act as a positive catalyst for change in Bahrain.I have met representatives of the RCSI and officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also maintain regular contact regarding the situation in Bahrain, about which the RCSI is very concerned. It is my understanding that the RCSI has at all times sought to use its influence in a positive way, by encouraging the Bahraini authorities to embark upon a process of reconciliation and pointing out the damage that current actions are having on Bahrain's international reputation.I have already placed on record my views on the RCSI on a number of occasions and would again emphasise that it is necessary to distinguish between the involvement of the Royal College of Surgeons in the training of Bahraini medical personnel, which is entirely positive, and the detention of medical personnel by the Bahraini authorities, about which the Government is very concerned. I would further add that I regard the activities of the RCSI in assisting with the training of foreign medical personnel overseas as a highly worthwhile activity through which the College makes a significant contribution to the quality of life of millions of people around the world.  The RCSI, as an educational provider, also has a responsibility to all of its students and ensuring they are able to complete their medical training.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will remain vigilant and continue to exert pressure bilaterally and through the EU regarding Bahrain.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	512	Marked gas oil, commonly known as green diesel, is subject to Mineral Oil Tax at the rate of €88.66 per 1,000 litres, while the rate for auto-diesel is €465.70 per 1,000 litres. In addition, marked gas oil is subject to a lower VAT rate of 13.5 per cent. The resulting total tax differential is around 50 cent a litre. Marked kerosene is subject to a rate of Mineral Oil Tax, €38.02 per 1,000 litres, which is also considerably lower than that for auto-diesel.  This difference in rates offers a considerable incentive for oil laundering. The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for collection of Mineral Oil Tax and the control of mineral oils, are very aware of the threat posed by laundered fuel, and undertake a multi-faceted programme of enforcement action to counter it (see details below).It is assumed that the Deputy's question envisages a movement away from the current system of marking of oil to which a reduced rate of tax applies, to one in which certain users would be given refunds of part of the Mineral Oil Tax paid on oil consumed by them. This would, however, involve the establishment of an extensive repayments system, which would give rise to a considerable administrative burden and costs for oil traders, users and Revenue. It is important to note that marked gas oil has a number of uses such as agricultural diesel, home heating oil among others.  Moreover, repayment systems are vulnerable to abuse and likely to be exploited by criminal elements, such as those currently involved in oil laundering. In addition, as oil can also be laundered from UK marked gas oil, a move away from marking would not eliminate the problem of oil laundering unless the UK were to do likewise. For these reasons, the intention is to ensure that controls relating to the sale and distribution of oils, and enforcement action in combating illegal oil laundering activity are as effective as possible.Mineral Oil EnforcementRevenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils. These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.In 2010, Revenue enforcement staff detected four oil-laundering plants in this jurisdiction and seized 228,000 litres of laundered oil. In addition, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil and eight haulage companies were detected using it in their vehicles. There were four Court convictions last year for laundered oil offences. So far this year, nine oil laundries and 327,000 litres of laundered fuel have been seized, together with nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles. Thirteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of two of the cases.  Revenue will maintain its programme of stringent action against this illegal trade, and will continue to work closely with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in Northern Ireland to address the problem on an all-island basis.Legal changes have been introduced over recent years to support Revenue's work in this area, including a power to raise assessments on companies and individuals in respect of evaded excise duty. As well as this, the Finance Act 2010 provided for a substantial increase in the fine that may be imposed where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence relating to mineral oils: the previous fine of €12,695 was replaced by a fine not exceeding €126,970.  Other possible changes to the law, in particular from the point of view of control of the supply of oil, will be considering in the forthcoming Finance Bill process and in addition, the potential development of an enhanced fuel marker is being considered.

The NTMA has the necessary specialist skills to manage NewERA and its business model provides it with the flexibility to compete in the market to recruit additional specialist staff as required.  The policy objective behind NewERA is to modernise the manner in which Government manages its shareholding in the semi-state companies and it will oversee the corporate governance from a shareholder perspective of the ESB, Bord Gáis, EirGrid, Bord na Mona and Coillte.In this capacity, NewERA will have responsibility for reviewing the capital investment plans of these commercial semi-state companies and will identify possible synergies between the investment programmes of the different companies. Where requested by Government, it will also advise on, and if appropriate oversee, any restructuring or disposal of State companies. It will also work with Departments to develop and implement proposals for investment in line with NewERA Programme for Government commitments in energy, water and next-generation telecommunications.Regarding publication of details of remuneration, the NTMA complies with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and publishes details of the remuneration of the Chief Executives of the NTMA, the NDFA and NAMA in the relevant annual reports.  In addition, I have supplied information on salary bands and performance-related payments in the NTMA in response to Parliamentary Questions.Furthermore, I have stated that the approach to remuneration in the NTMA will be examined in more detail in the coming months following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As part of this process, the views of the NTMA and the NTMA Advisory Committee will be taken into account. Following detailed examination of this matter, I will then see what changes, if any, might be appropriate in relation to the remuneration of all staff in the NTMA, having regard to the changing economic circumstances of the State and the need for transparency in public expenditure.

It is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate or comment in advance of the Budget what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from that practice. The Deputy may wish to note that in relation to potential Budgetary measures such as this that cross-border issues are taken into consideration.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Part 5 of the Credit Institution (Stabilisation) Act 2010 ("CIS Act") provides the Minister with the power to transfer assets and/or liabilities of a "relevant institution" — i.e. an institution within the scope of the CIS Act — to another institution, subject to the approval of the Court. Part 5 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill ("the Bill") provides the Central Bank with similar powers to transfer the assets and/or liabilities of an "authorised credit institution" — i.e. an institution within the scope of the Bill — to another institution subject to the approval of the Court.  To address any overlaps between the scope of the CIS Act and the Bill following its enactment, section 3 of the Bill provides that where an institution is a relevant institution within the scope of the CIS Act, it does not fall within the scope of the Bill.The CIS Act ceases to have effect on 31 December 2012, or a later date substituted by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and from that point on all relevant institutions will be considered authorised credit institutions and will fall within the scope of the Bill.  In addition under section 55 of the CIS Act the Minister can, after consulting with the Governor of the Central Bank, make an order to declare that a relevant institution shall be taken not to be a relevant institution for the period specified in the order. In this event, section 3 of the Bill provides that the institution will fall under the scope of the Bill and not the CISA for that specified period.Section 61 of the CIS Act does not confer on the Minister for Finance a power as described in the Deputy’s question. Section 61 of the CIS Act 2010 deals with instruments to which relevant institutions or their subsidiaries or holding companies are a party. Commercial instruments frequently provide for their termination or other consequences where the ownership in or control of one of the contracting parties changes, where particular orders are made against the parties or where certain events happen. The section specifies that certain consequences for such instruments, such as termination, or triggering of payments due, shall not have effect as a result of the Act or the announcement by the Minister of the intention to enact this legislation, or any statement made by the Minister or the Governor of the Central Bank in relation to this Act or the use of any powers in the Act. Neither shall these consequences arise as a result of the making of an order or requirement for the making of an order or any act taken or omitted by any person in compliance with the order. A similar provision is made in the Bill in section 99 of the Bill as amended in the Select Sub-Committee on Finance.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of audits carried out in relation to Medical Practice activities in each of the Years 2007 to 2011 (to August), and the related yield across all tax heads, business and personal, is as follows:YearNo. of Audits€m2007992.69m [62 yielding/63%]200889€2.54m [65 yielding/75%]200987€3.59m [66 yielding/75%]*2010156€3.30m [113 yielding/72%]*2011 (to August)146€3.24m. [104 yielding/71%]**yielding cases in 2009 to 2011 includes cases where there was no cash yield but reliefs and losses were restricted.The increased activity in 2011 reflects Revenue's focus on self-assessed taxpayers in the cash economy.These statistics are compiled based on cases with a NACE Code of 8512. NACE Code 8512 is a classification that encompasses a broad range of practitioners and businesses in the medical sphere including doctors, consultants such as eye specialists, homoeopaths, physiologists etc.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that General Practitioners are controlled and monitored for tax compliance purposes in the same way as taxpayers in all other sectors. General Practitioners, like all taxpayers, are obliged to make accurate returns under the self-assessment system and are liable to Revenue audit in the normal way. I am assured by Revenue that the audit of General Practitioners is an ongoing aspect of their work.The main focus of Revenue continues to be on selecting cases for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted intervention that gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future. The targeted approach is greatly enhanced by the computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) developed by Revenue. This system categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria. The system allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for checks or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers are risk assessed a number of times a year. REAP contains considerable information on all self-assessed taxpayers, including General Practitioners.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	519	There are a number of measures in place to assist people who are having genuine difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments.  The Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.   The Code came into effect on 1 January 2011.  With effect from 30 June 2011, lenders must have in place the required systems and trained staff necessary to support the implementation of the Code. The Code sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears or are in pre-arrears.  For the purposes of the Code a "pre-arrears" case arises when the borrower contacts the lender stating that he or she is in danger of getting into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about getting into mortgage arrears.  The Code can be accessed at www.centralbank.ie. The Central Bank has produced, with input from the National Consumer Agency, a consumer guide to assist consumers in understanding the new process under the revised Code.  Financial assistance is available to eligible claimants under the Department of Social Protection's Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme.  People in debt or in danger of getting into debt can avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  This is a national, free, confidential, and independent service.The Government, however, also recognises that more needs to be done in this area and prior to the Summer recess the Economic Management Council asked an Inter-Departmental Group to consider further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-debtedness. The Group's report was published yesterday and is available on my Department's website.  The Government are proposing that the Dail be given an opportunity to debate the findings and recommendations of the report and will make time for a debate next week. This will give all sides of the House the opportunity to contribute in a constructive and realistic manner to the deliberations on this important issue. The Minister for Justice and Equality and myself will formulate an implementation strategy to be set out at the conclusion of the Dail debate. This implementation strategy will set out the necessary steps to put into effect all the measures that are deemed feasible.In the meantime work is already underway to implement some of the key recommendations of the report:-The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for Housing and Planning will launch two mortgage-to-rent schemes in line with the report's recommendations. These will operate on a pilot basis initially subject to prompt review ahead of wider roll-out. Under each scheme households in extreme mortgage distress who are eligible for social housing will be able to remain in their homes as social housing tenants with either their lending institution or a housing association taking ownership of the property.The Minister for Justice and Equality has already undertaken extensive work on the Heads of a Personal Insolvency Bill as set out in the report and these will be published shortly.I have instructed the Banking Division of my Department to begin discussions with the banks to ensure speedy implementation of the measures set out in the report.

The EFSF Amendments are currently the subject of ratification by all Euro Area Member States. The parliamentary procedures are completed in sixteen out of the seventeen countries at this stage. Slovakia has yet to complete its parliamentary procedures. It is understood that Slovakia is endeavouring to complete these procedures by the end of this week.The amendment EFSF Framework Agreement, which enables the interest rate reductions, will take legal effect when all Euro Area  Member States have completed the ratification of the amendments. It will be applied to our EFSF loans once a revised loan agreement has been signed.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	523	During 2009 it was determined that Anglo and INBS required additional capital. A commitment was provided by the Minister to Anglo and separately to INBS to provide capital of €8.3 billion and €2.7 billion, respectively. This capital was provided on 31 March 2010.  In relation to Anglo, this €8.3 billion of capital was injected by way of a capital contribution. This capital contribution is treated as equity capital for regulatory capital purposes. In relation to INBS, a special investment share was acquired for €100 million in cash and a further €2.6 billion was subsequently injected by way of a capital contribution.The Government did not pay for these capital contributions in Anglo and INBS with cash. The Government effectively issued an IOU, in the form of promissory notes, to Anglo and INBS for €8.3 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively.  As the State had a debt to the institutions, it also had an associated interest charge. This interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue on 31 March 2010.  Subsequently, it was determined that Anglo and INBS needed additional capital, which was again provided by increasing the 31 March 2010 promissory notes. The final promissory note increase was on 31 December 2010 bringing the total promissory notes in Anglo and INBS to €30.6 billion. See table below for the increases:DateAngloINBSTotal (IBRC)€ billion€ billion€ billion31 March 20108.302.6010.9028 May 20102.00—2.0023 August 20108.58—8.5831 December 20106.422.709.1225.305.3030.60When the final capital contribution was made on 31 December 2011 an interest holiday was inserted into each of the promissory notes which meant that between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 no interest was payable. Absent the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate on these promissory notes would have been 5.8%. However, as a result of the insertion of the interest holiday the weighted average interest rate from 1 January 2013 is 8.2%.While there was an interest holiday this does not affect the promissory note repayments of the principal amount. The cash flows on the promissory notes are 10% (€3.06billion) of the original amount per annum until the full amount is repaid. Set out below is a detailed aggregated schedule of capital repayments and interest payments on the promissory notes:DateTotal interest  Paid: ATotal Capital Reduction: BRepayments: A + B€bn€bn€bn31/0320110.552.513.0631/032012—3.063.0631/0320130.492.573.0631/0320141.841.223.0631/0320151.751.313.0631/0320161.651.413.0631/0320171.551.513.0631/0320181.441.623.0631/0320191.321.743.0631/0320201.191.873.0631/0320211.062.003.0631/0320220.912.153.0631/0320230.752.313.0631/0320240.571.522.0931/0320250.450.470.9131/0320260.390.520.9131/0320270.330.580.9131/0320280.260.650.9131/0320290.190.730.9131/0320300.100.810.9131/0320310.010.050.0516.830.647.4*These numbers may not tot exactly as a result of roundingAs set out above, the total interest cost for the State for all tranches of the Anglo and Irish Nationwide promissory notes is €16.8 billion with annual repayments of €3.06 billion per annum until 2023, reducing thereafter until 2031 when the final repayment is made. These annual repayments reduce over time as the various tranches of the promissory notes are repaid. The final payment on the promissory notes of circa €0.1 billion will be made on 31 March 2031. The total cost of the promissory notes including the principle amount and interest will be €47.4 billion over the life of the promissory notes.The Deputy will be aware that the funds which become available to the State as a result of borrowing undertaken by the Exchequer are not generally assigned to one particular area of expenditure. Rather they are available, along with the funds sourced from revenues such as tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts, to fund overall expenditure. Accordingly, there was no one tranche of borrowing that was undertaken solely for the purpose of funding the Promissory Note payments to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.The draw downs of funds so far under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been used for a range of different purposes including of course the general running of the day-to-day operations of the State. It is difficult therefore to isolate precisely the exact cost of the interest payments on the borrowing undertaken to fund the Promissory Note payments. However, for illustrative purposes, on the basis of the original 5.8% blended average interest rate which applied to borrowing under the Programme, the interest costs on borrowing of €3,060 million would be just under €180 million per annum. In light of the recently agreed reduction in interest rates on funding available under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support however, the estimated interest cost on such borrowing reduces to approximately €115 million per annum.While the State has budgeted to meet both the interest and cash requirements I am eager to have the Promissory Notes examined to see if they can be re-engineered in a better way for the State, for example, by lengthening their maturity and reducing their interest rate on them. This examination, which has commenced, will have to be completed in a manner which does not impact on the capital position of Anglo.  In addition to the Promissory Notes issued to Anglo and INBS a Promissory Note was also issued to EBS. For completeness, the following is the detail of this Note.DateTotal interest Paid: ATotal capital reduction: BRepayments: A + B€bn€bn€bn17/06/20110.0140.0110.02517/06/20120.0130.0120.02517/06/20130.0120.0130.02517/06/20140.0120.0130.02517/06/20150.0110.0140.02517/06/20160.0100.0150.02517/06/20170.0090.0160.02517/06/20180.0090.0160.02517/06/20190.0080.0170.02517/06/20200.0070.0180.02517/06/20210.0060.0190.02517/06/20220.0050.0200.02517/06/20230.0040.0210.02517/06/20240.0020.0230.02517/06/20250.0010.0200.0220.120.250.37The Promissory Note carries an interest rate of 5.5% with annual repayments of €25mn on 17 June.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	524	Earlier this year, the Economic Management Council, of which I am a member, requested an Inter-Departmental Group to consider further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness. The Group's report was published yesterday and is available on my Department's website.The Government are proposing that the Dáil be given an opportunity to debate the findings and recommendations of the report and will make time for a debate next week. This will give all sides of the House the opportunity to contribute in a constructive and realistic manner to the deliberations on this important issue. The Minister for Justice and Equality and myself will formulate an implementation strategy to be set out at the conclusion of the Dail debate. This implementation strategy will set out the necessary steps to put into effect all the measures that are deemed feasible.   In the meantime work is already underway to implement some of the key recommendations of the report:—The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for Housing and Planning will launch two mortgage-to-rent schemes in line with the report's recommendations. These will operate on a pilot basis initially subject to prompt review ahead of wider roll-out. Under each scheme households in extreme mortgage distress who are eligible for social housing will be able to remain in their homes as social housing tenants with either their lending institution or a housing association taking ownership of the property.The Minister for Justice and Equality has already undertaken extensive work on the Heads of a Personal Insolvency Bill as set out in the report and these will be published shortly.I have instructed the Banking Division of my Department to begin discussions with the banks to ensure speedy implementation of the measures set out in the report.

The figure for Exceptional Liquidity Assistance (ELA) is contained within the other assets of the Financial Statement of the Central Bank of Ireland. As at the 26th of August the figure for other assets was €55.949bn. This figure is predominantly made up of ELA.A key component of the Financial Measures Programme is the establishment of transparent plans to reduce the Irish banking system to a manageable size and to stabilise its funding base. The Central Bank has agreed with the External Partners that a sustainable Loan to Deposit Ratio for the aggregate domestic banking system is 122.5%. Banks will implement deleveraging plans agreed with the Central Bank in order to transition to smaller balance sheets and a more stable funding base, which includes reduced reliance on ECB and ELA funding.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	526	As the Deputy is aware, the Government is considering burden sharing with senior bondholders in both Anglo and INBS in consultation with our EU partners. In the current circumstances, the State is not in a position or minded to act unilaterally in this regard.  I had the opportunity to meet with President Trichet on the margins of the Ecofin meeting in Poland on Saturday, 17th September. I raised with him the issue of the burden sharing with the senior unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo (including INBS). This was unresolved business and I pressed the case for such burden sharing. However, President Trichet was of the strong view that such action was not in the interests of Ireland or the Euro Area, particularly given the challenges facing the euro area at this time and the contagion that we witnessed recently that has affected Italy and Spain. Commissioner Rehn also made the same point on this issue when I met him at a separate meeting.President Trichet was very complimentary of the progress being made by Ireland and he noted the narrowing of bond spreads that had taken place, which he would not wish to see put at risk. I noted the points he made and I said I would report back to Government on the discussion.I also mentioned to President Trichet, and in the separate meeting with Commissioner Rehn, the situation in relation to the Promissory Notes. These Promissory Notes are amounts due from the State to Anglo Irish Bank as consideration for the capital provided in 2010. While the State has budgeted to meet both the interest and cash requirements I am eager to have the Promissory Notes examined to see if they can be re-engineered in a better way for the State, for example, by lengthening their maturity and reducing their interest rate. This re-engineering, which is under consideration, would have to be completed in a manner which does not impact on the capital position of Anglo.The Deputy will be aware that as bonds are usually issued in bearer form the purchasers of the bonds are unknown to the issuing bank.  When a bank issues a bond, whether by private placement or public issue, it would be usual practice for a securities depository company, such as Clearstream and Euroclear, to hold the bond on behalf of their customers and the banks would not necessarily know the actual owner of the bond.  Securities depository companies such as Clearstream and Euroclear usually manage, safekeep and administer the securities that it holds on behalf of the purchasers of the bonds and the identity of the purchasers of the bonds is not disclosed in the public domain or to the issuer.

Clearly the ECB has given very large amounts of liquidity assistance to Irish banks and it maintains a keen interest in the Irish banking sector.  In this regard, I would point to the statement of the ECB on 31 March last to the effect that against the background of the recapitalisation of the banks "the Eurosystem will continue to provide liquidity to banks in Ireland".  Together with other decisions announced on this date, the ECB was and is clear about its support for Irish banks, and I am not aware of anything to suggest otherwise.

The level and timeframe of any increases in the standard VAT rate will be determined in the context of the annual Budget cycle.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.  One of the changes announced included an increase to ten in the minimum number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to establish or retain an individual school transport service.Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that in this case, the number of applications from eligible pupils did not match the above requirement and consequently the service was withdrawn from the beginning of the current school year. This minimum number requirement has been applied to all individual school transport services nationally from the commencement of the 2011/12 school year.As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for a remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.  It is essential to stress that the wider context within which this change is taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and this measure is an integral part of this.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I have no plans to introduce driver education, in the form of driving lessons in schools, and this is not the norm within the EU. Research available internationally is inconclusive on the benefits of teaching young people to drive at school. Particular issues highlighted include the gap arising between the time practical skills are learned initially and put into regular practice, and the risks arising from more young people taking up driving at an earlier age.However, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year, has been developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Professional Development Service for Teachers and has been offered nationally as an option since September 2008, following a successful pilot in 2007/8. The programme is available in twenty hour and forty-five hour units. It features inputs from agencies such as the ambulance service, fire service and An Garda Síochána, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies.The programme provides for an introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seatbelts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink/drug driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation. The programme is also supported by digital resources, including DVD support and access to international websites on road safety issues. Relevant Driver Theory Test learning is included at the end of each module. The programme does not include driving lessons.In addition, the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way. Road safety programmes have been developed by the Road Safety Authority at primary and junior cycle level for this purpose.

However, Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and in non EU countries. This information may be useful to the student to which the Deputy refers.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I refer the Deputy to the decision of the previous Government to increase the pupil/teacher ratio in schools and to remove certain funding from Protestant fee-charging schools in the Budget of October 2008.There are currently 55 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 20 are Protestant, two Inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remaining 32 Catholic.It is estimated that the withdrawal, with effect from 1 January 2009, of the ancillary grant to fee-charging schools with a Protestant ethos has realised an annual saving of €2.8m to the Exchequer. The grant was withdrawn due to concerns about the constitutionality of making it available to fee-charging schools of one ethos and not to those of another.  Fee-charging schools do not receive capitation or related supports and since becoming Minister, I have prioritised the limited funding available for Summer Works Schemes to non fee-paying schools on the grounds of equity.The previous Government also decided in October 2008 to make changes to how fee-charging schools should be treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated. Teachers in fee-charging schools are now allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20 to 1, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools. Teachers in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State; this arrangement pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements and has existed since the foundation of the state. The estimated cost of these posts in 2011 is in the order of €100m and the estimated saving for a one point increase in the pupil/teacher ratio is €3 million. I am already on record as saying that this is not a simple matter as these arrangements, which are historic and of long standing, impact upon a substantial number of schools which cater for religious minorities.I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos. My Department provides funds for the Protestant Block grant, which currently amounts to €6.5 million per year.  The block grant is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee, established by the Protestant churches involved in the provision of education. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.In this regard, I wish to advise the Deputy that students who board at a Protestant school which does not charge fees may also apply for a grant from the Secondary Education Committee to assist with boarding costs.   I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.

While the terms of office for these appointments are for a five year period the NQAI is to be merged with both the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) to form a new body to be known as the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI) in the coming months. No remuneration applicable.Mr. Micheál Ó Fiannachta, a Departmental official,  was appointed to the Board of Skillnets Ltd with effect from June 2011. No remuneration applicable.Dr Maria Hinfelaar and Mr Aengus Ó Maoláin were appointed to the Higher Education and Awards Council (HETAC) in June 2011. No remuneration applicable. Like the NQAI, this body is to be merged into the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland in the coming months. It is customary for the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) to have one representative on the board of HETAC. Mr Ó Maoláin was nominated by the USI.Ms. Maureen Costello was appointed to the National Council for Special Education Board in September 2011. No remuneration applicable. Ms. Costello is the Director of the National Educational Psychological Service and her appointment was made because of the close interactions between the two agencies concerned.Mr. Michael Moriarty was appointed to the FÁS Board in July 2011. Remuneration fee of €11,790 per annum applicable. The vacancy on the FÁS Board arose in July 2011 following the resignation of Mr. Sean Gallagher. Mr. Moriarty, who is General Secretary of the IVEA, was appointed because of his expertise in the Vocational Education Committees which will be availed of particularly when FÁS is transformed into SOLAS, the new further education and training authority.Mr. Gary Redmond was re-appointed to the Higher Education Authority in July 2011. Remuneration fee of €7,695 per annum applicable. It is customary for the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) to have one representative on the board of the Higher Education Authority. Mr. Redmond was nominated by the USI.None of the appointments above were to the position of Chairperson in the bodies concerned.  My Department's officials are currently considering options to effect the government decision regarding direct Ministerial appointments to Boards and issues regarding the public advertising of future vacancies will be considered in this context.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.The NCSE has recently published statistical information in relation to the allocation of Special Needs Assistant posts and resource teaching hours to Primary Special and Post Primary Schools. The information is provided on a county by county and school by school basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.  The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 4 SNA posts and 55.8 Resource Teaching Hours.  It is considered that, with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	538	On 7 October 2011 the European Commission approved co-financing of €35.7m under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of three applications for assistance submitted in June 2010 for almost 9,000 former workers made redundant in the construction NACE 41, 43 and 71 subsectors between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010. These applications still require to be approved by the other EU budgetary authorities of the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. In total, including national co-financing, the three applications will total €55m to provide guidance, training, education and enterprise supports to eligible beneficiaries.A number of national measures, for which EGF co-financing has been sought, are already being provided by the relevant service providers and funded from national sources. These measures include career guidance, full, part-time and evening further education and training courses, apprenticeship on- and off-the-job training, full and part-time third level education programmes and related training and education allowances where appropriate.The main service providers delivering these supports are FÁS, Vocational Education Committees and publicly funded higher education institutes. Training is also being provided through contracted private providers and the technical employment support grant mechanism administered by FÁS.  As data is being collated from a number of service providers at present, it is not possible to provide a breakdown by county of expenditure and participation rates to date. It is estimated nationally that at least 4,500 interventions for this cohort have been commenced in the areas of guidance, training and third level education.All eligible individual beneficiaries will be contacted in due course and be made aware of the specific interventions available to them under the relevant EGF programmes. I will make a further announcement on how those interventions will be made available and on how eligible persons will be informed in the next couple of weeks.

The 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 contains a number of actions relating to improving the quality of Irish teaching.  A working group has recently been established, under the auspices of the Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht, to scope out and agree the steps required to implement the strategy over the 20 year period. Implementation will also have to take account of the availability of resources.This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and will deliver on the achievable goals and targets proposed.  There are already a range of supports through the teaching support services and the education centre network in all subject and programme areas. If there are specific needs identified, the support services endeavour to respond within the resources at their disposal.  Should my Department wish to commission work by an external provider, there is an obligation to undergo a public competitive process.

As I announced publicly this week, my Department is now satisfied, after detailed investigation and on the basis of subsequent information received, that a sustainable  application can be made in due course to the European Commission.In order to ensure that a reasoned and detailed case satisfying the stringent EGF eligibility conditions can be advanced with the greatest prospect of success, the next step is the technical application preparation process involving the collection, verification and analysis of supporting data and the development of a tailored package of support for each individual redundant worker. This process has duly commenced in the Department. It will take a period of some weeks at least to complete.  In the meantime, my Department will continue to work with all relevant stakeholders who are currently providing services to the workers and to seek to develop any additional measures for implementation as quickly as possible. I would also propose to meet with the workers as soon as possible to explain the EGF process and to set out our plans to provide supports to help them get back to work.

When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA).  In the conduct of elections under the Election Acts, Returning Officers and their staff will be indemnified by the State from all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of injury to any person or loss or damage of any kind.The State, its servants and/or agents, will indemnify the owner of the third party premises in respect of any claims for personal injury and third party property damage, arising from the negligence of the State, its servants and/or agents in respect of the use of the third party premises by the State for polling station purposes.  This indemnity extends to cover only the negligence of the State, its servants and/or agents, and does not extend to indemnify any third party, its servants and/or agents concerning any negligent act or omission by the latter by reference to Statute or at Common Law.  It would be expected that third parties would have adequate public liability insurance in place to cover potential losses associated with their negligence.

In recent times, the Government's financial position is of course particularly difficult, and a moratorium on the filling of vacancies arising in all Departments, Offices and agencies has been in operation since early 2009.Against this background, the Government is however determined to facilitate the delivery of the industrial employment and other targets in the current IDA Strategy.  To achieve this, IDA is amongst those who have been approved, in recent times,through consultation with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to fill mission-critical vacancies that would otherwise have remained vacant under the moratorium.  I am glad to say that one of these posts has been that of North West Regional Manager based in Sligo.  I have been informed by IDA that a competitive process in underway to fill this post.

The reform proposals deal with recommendations made and issues raised in the Independent Report on the JLC/REA systems (Duffy-Walsh report) as well as the outcome of the recent High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken constitutional challenge.The proposed measures will provide for the retention of the JLC and REA systems, subject to the reforms that are required to place them on a more secure legal and constitutional footing.  They will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling.The report of the Independent Review does not recommend, nor have I proposed, specific adjustments in wage rates for the sectors covered by JLCs and REAs.  Heads of a Bill to give effect to the reform proposals have been prepared by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, agreed by Government, and communicated to the Attorney General, who has agreed to give the highest priority to drafting this legislation.  It is my intention is to have a Bill ready to introduce to the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity this term.

Following further correspondence received by the appeals office on behalf of the person the appeal was re-opened and an oral hearing was heard in the case.The appeal was allowed, with assessable means derived from the capital value of a property plus rental income, entitling the person to a reduced weekly rate of disability allowance.  The person's disability allowance was awarded on 9 August 2011 with effect from 12 August 2009.  The person's claim will now be forwarded to a Social Welfare Investigator in order to review his weekly means.

The person must be a certain age, be in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, and be pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college.In addition, the approved course must lead to a higher qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications than that already held by the person.  Progression has always been a feature of the BTEA.  Graduates do not have an entitlement to the BTEA to pursue a further full time course at a similar qualification level to that already held by the person, as this could, inter alia, lead to displacement of other persons seeking such qualifications for the first time.The person concerned applied for a BTEA.  The application was not approved as the person already holds a qualification at a higher level than the one in respect of which the application was made.  I have reviewed the application, but, under the circumstances, it is not possible to approve the BTEA.Springboard is part of the Government's Jobs Initiative.  It offers people the opportunity to study on a part-time basis for higher education qualifications in areas where more employment opportunities are expected to arise as the economy recovers.  The course that the person concerned is pursuing is a full-time course and, therefore, does not come within the scope of the Springboard Initiative.Other forms of support to persons who wish to further their qualifications include the option of retaining a jobseeker's payment while pursuing a part-time education course.  The person must apply to the social welfare local office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce availability for work.  In the case of jobseeker's benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period in respect of which the benefit is paid.  It is also open to persons to apply to their local authority for a student grant.

PRSI paid under Class S contributes to building entitlement to long-term benefits such as the State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  If self-employed people are on low incomes as a result of a downturn in demand for their services, they may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments including payments such as jobseeker's allowance.For the purposes of establishing their entitlement to assistance-based payments, the individual's means will take account of the level of earnings in the last 12 months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  An individual who continues to be self-employed while in receipt of a social assistance payment such as jobseeker's allowance may continue to pay Class S contributions as long as his or her income from self-employment exceeds the €5,000 insurability threshold.  This would assist towards establishing their entitlement to long-term social insurance pensions.

In this context, it should be noted that only PRSI paid at class A, E, H, or P counts towards this benefit.  According to the Department's records, the person concerned has no reckonable contributions paid in the relevant years so neither they nor their spouse qualify for this benefit.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case.  There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer having fully considered all the available evidence disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.  Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer agreed to review the case.   The Appeal Officer concluded that there were insufficient grounds for a revision of his earlier decision.Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  The legislation also provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence. This course of action was taken in this case as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 99 together.At the end of August 2011 there were 7,901 disability allowance claims pending decision. The statistics requested are shown in the tabular statement.  The average number of weeks taken to decide a disability allowance claim for the period January to August 2011 was just over 16 weeks.The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the department, including disability allowance section, to ensure that claims are processed and decided in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.Measures being taken to improve processing times for disability allowance applicants include an increase in the number of claims being desk assessed thus reducing the number of cases being referred for investigation by social welfare inspectors.  Since August 2009 all claims are being desk assessed by the medical assessors thus obviating the need to call claimants for in-person medical examinations. Since November 2010, all medical reports for new disability allowance claims are being scanned which facilitates easier access by more medical assessors.  Additional temporary staff has been deployed to assist with backlog clearance and will be in place until December 2011.As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation the disability allowance scheme will be moved onto a new IT administration platform.  This work commenced in July of this year and it is expected that the first batch of new claims will be dealt with on the new system in the first quarter of 2012.   It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to customers.YearNo. of Applications ReceivedNo. of Applications ApprovedNo. of Applications Disallowed200821,35813,1768,046200920,79410,1799,677201021,4098,30610,3162011 (To 31/08/11)15,4516,0517,909
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	570	I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 1,524 Carers Allowance appeals in progress in the Office. This compares to 594 at the end of 2008, 1,339 at the end of 2009 and 2,145 at the end of 2010.In April of this year the Department appointed 9 additional Appeals Officers who, together with the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, brought the total number of appeals officers serving in the Office to 29.   In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired appeals officers, equating to a further 3 full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.In that regard  some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring-fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced appeals officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.   This project commenced on July 1st.  Also, some 70% of appeals cases are now decided by way of summary decision which. because of the logistics involved in organizing oral hearings, greatly reduces the overall processing times.As a result of the various initiatives taken,18,236  decisions were made by appeals officers in the first nine months of 2011, in comparison to 12,692 for the same period in 2010 and the backlog of cases awaiting determination has reduced from 20,274 at the beginning of the year to 17,651 at 30th September 2011.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	573	The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection.  The objective is to integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit which will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and, or, advice about their training options.  A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is to prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.As part of this reform agenda, on 1st October 2011, the Community Welfare Service transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The transfer of the Community Welfare Service to my Department is an important element in the establishment of the new National Employment and Entitlements Service.  The development of this new service is the start of a major and comprehensive programme of change management entailing the integration of services previously, or currently, provided by other agencies — including both the Community Welfare Services of the HSE and the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of FÁS. A key principle of the new service will be that proactive engagement on the part of the individual in seeking employment and improving employability will be a precondition of benefits payments.In July 2011, the Government decided to create a new further education and training authority called SOLAS under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  SOLAS will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors both to the National Skills Strategy objectives and to the significant increase in demand due to the current employment situation. It will facilitate the further education sector in playing a significant role in the work of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.

In the 2010/2011 academic year there were 25,032 participants which represented an increase of 20.3% on the previous academic year. The 2009/2010 academic year saw an increase of 79% on the previous year.  The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

The obligation to notify such changes is provided for in social welfare legislation.  The specific changes of circumstance which must be reported are listed in the IQA award letter and in a range of related information publications.Under the Department's Control Strategy, scheme administrations are obliged to carry out annual and periodic reviews of IQA entitlement.  Review projects for State pension (contributory) and Invalidity pension recipients are currently being undertaken.  It is the Departments policy to pursue the full recovery of all overpayments identified in these control activities in accordance with its debt recovery guidelines, and to put in place a debt recovery plan by agreement with the person concerned at a rate of repayment which does not cause them undue financial hardship.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I am aware of the call from the Union of Students of Ireland to reduce the JobBridge qualifying period from three months to four weeks.  However, it should be noted one of the policy objectives of the JobBridge scheme is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.It should also be noted that approximately 60% of individuals who first sign onto the Live Register actually sign off within the first three months.  Reducing the three month eligibility period would have implications for this factor and consequently increase the Live Register cost to the Exchequer.  The optimum time for interventions of this nature is set therefore at three months which represents a reasonable timeframe within which graduates and others who have become unemployed can seek employment.  It is not therefore intended to change eligibility criterion.

The funding position for the programme in 2012 will be determined in the context of the forthcoming budget.  I have no immediate proposals to alter the operation of the programme which currently supports some 2,800 people in full and part time employment.

These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 4th August 2011 and the appeal was assigned to an Appeals Officer on 14 September 2011 who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 to 116, inclusive, together.The community welfare service (CWS), and the community welfare officers providing it, transferred formally to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) from 1 October 2011.  The service and the staff are now part of the DSP.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.Current legislation provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's written request and subject to the consent of the Department.  Where a tenant wishes to have the rent supplement paid directly to the landlord, the tenant is requested to sign an indemnity form authorising payment of the supplement directly to the landlord. The form does not have to be signed in the presence of the Department's representative.  Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.Under the current arrangements, even with direct payment, landlords still have to collect the tenant contribution towards their rent (a minimum of €104 per month). The amount of rent supplement payable depends on the tenant's income; in some cases tenants pay only the minimum contribution while for others the tenant makes an additional contribution to their rent based on their financial circumstances.  For example, where a person is in part-time income and receives just 10% of his or her rent directly from the State, the landlord would receive the 10% directly whilst still having to collect the 90% from the tenant.It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant.Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to have the dispute resolved through the Board's dispute resolution process.

Under Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts, the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction by other means of vegetation growing on uncultivated land or in hedges or ditches is prohibited during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife, from 1 March to 31 August. This is subject to certain exceptions, which address practical issues in the ordinary course of agriculture and forestry, as well as fisheries development works; destruction of noxious weeds; road construction and other building works; and the extinguishing or prevention of a fire.Burning of upland areas, in patches and in a suitable rotation, can be a useful tool in preventing large, wild fires and can be compatible with sustainable ecological management and is allowed in the six months outside the prohibited period.  However, my Department's consent may be required for any burning in some Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas.  Local staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service will provide advice on this matter. Consent will be given where the activity has no negative impact on the habitats and species of conservation interest in the site in question, and where it is clear that there are adequate precautions in place to ensure that the fire can be controlled.

To that end, I have requested the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct research and advise on the environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing as a means of extracting natural gas from underground reserves.  However, I would point out that my Department has not received applications for, nor licensed the use of hydraulic fracturing in the Irish onshore at this time.The three onshore petroleum licensing options awarded earlier this year are preliminary authorisations and are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data.  Exploration drilling, including drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing is specifically excluded under these licensing options.In the event that any of the companies involved decide to apply for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing, the application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.  The application would then be the subject of an environmental impact assessment which would include a public consultation phase.  In assessing the application, my Department would also consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the EPA and the National Parks and Wildlife Service before reaching any decision.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I can confirm that my Department has had informal contact with the Northern Ireland Authorities in relation to onshore petroleum authorisations in the North West Carboniferous Basin.  The petroleum authorisations granted in both jurisdictions are at a very early stage and engagement will continue should these authorisations proceed to the drilling stage.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Issues relating to television coverage in specific areas of the country are an operational matter for RTÉ.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTÉ to roll-out a digital TV network to the same extent as the analogue TV network.  RTÉ has informed my Department that the current analogue TV network covers 98% of the population and that its new digital TV network called Saorview will also cover 98% of the population.  RTÉ has developed a website providing information on the Saorview service including coverage information and this is available on its website www.saorview.ie.In addition, RTÉ is planning to launch a new ‘free-to-air' satellite service to cover the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  It is my understanding that, once the satellite service has launched, it will mean that Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.  RTÉ is currently testing the satellite service to check, inter alia, coverage and other issues and to ensure the availability of satellite receivers, once it launches.  RTÉ considers that the service will be ready to launch in early 2012.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I am aware of the increased incidence of metal theft, which is a matter for the Garda in the first instance.  Waste disposal and recovery activities in Ireland are required to hold an authorisation in accordance with the Waste Management Act 1996.  Depending on the authorisation required, these activities are controlled either by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the case of higher risk facilities and larger scale activities, or by local authorities, and a variety of regulations exist including waste stream specific regulations for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and End of Life Vehicles (ELVs).The problem of large numbers of unauthorised ELV sites is high on the list of enforcement priorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement — through its Enforcement Network of local authorities and other key agencies — is coordinating actions to deal with this problem.  This has resulted in a significant decline in unauthorised facilities from over 300 in December 2008 to less than 50 currently, and I expect that a continued concerted multi-agency approach to enforcement will see this number decline further over the coming months.  I am satisfied that all possible steps are being taken to address the issue and that existing powers in that regard are adequate to deal with the problem.I am also aware of increased instances of unauthorised Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and End of Life Vehicles (ELVs) collections. Inadequately treated e-waste poses very significant environmental and health risks.  Under the WEEE Regulations, retailers are obliged to take back WEEE from householders free of charge on a one-for-one like-for-like basis and members of the public can deposit household WEEE free of charge at local authority civic amenity facilities.  All household WEEE deposited at retailers and civic amenity facilities is collected and recycled by two approved collective compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and the European Recycling Platform (ERP), and is treated in the appropriate manner.Where the registered owner of a specified vehicle intends to discard that vehicle as waste, the End of Life Vehicle Regulations place an obligation on the owner to deposit that vehicle at an authorised treatment facility for appropriate treatment and recovery. This service is free of charge to members of the public and only authorised treatment facilities can issue a Certificate of Destruction. The Regulations also impose improved environmental standards to ensure that when a vehicle is scrapped, as much material as possible is recovered and recycled and that it takes place in a way that does not harm the environment.In addition, in a drive to boost recycling markets, the European Union has adopted quality criteria for iron, steel and aluminium scrap, with similar rules in the pipeline for other materials such as copper. Council Regulation (EU) No 333/2011, which came into operation on 9 October 2011, sets out conditions to be fulfilled for each scrap material before it can be freely traded within the EU's internal market.  Iron, steel and aluminium scrap should be sufficiently pure and meet the relevant scrap standards or specifications required by the metal producing industry. The new regulation is expected to create legal certainty and a level playing field for the recycling industry, and remove administrative burdens for the recycling sector by releasing safe and clean secondary raw materials from the scope of waste legislation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	595	The Nitrates Directive and Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme are given legal effect by the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010. The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season, in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water. In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations provide for periods when the application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited. In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.The Irish Farmers Association has requested a deferral of the start of the closed period by 2 weeks, given the abnormally high rain fall during the month of September.  I have considered this application in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We recognise that the adverse weather conditions experienced in Ireland during September, in particular, have caused significant hardship for farmers and have made it extremely difficult to carry out regular farming activity.  Consequently, I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to grant a two week extension to the period during which slurry may be spread, up to 31 October 2011.

The position of Chair is advertised publicly. A new Chairperson, Dr. Mary Kelly, appointed by the Government in accordance with section 105 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011, commenced her seven year term on 29 August 2011. The Chairperson of An Bord Pleanála holds office on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance and in accordance with section 106(14) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011. While the pay of the Chairperson of the Board of An Bord Pleanála is currently linked to the pay of a judge of the High Court (€206,616), it will be adjusted downwards to not more than a new entrant Secretary General Level 3 on enactment of legislation scheduled for later this year.The two appointments to the Building Regulations Advisory Board (BRAB) preceded the Government decision on advertising vacancies on State Boards.In July 2011 my Department placed a notice on its website seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced persons for consideration for appointments to State Bodies under its remit.  Initially there were only vacancies in Irish Water Safety to be filled, but the notice pointed out that any expressions of interest would be kept on file and considered once a vacancy arises.All appointments will be made in accordance with the legislation governing appointments to each body.  The Minister will not be restricted to considering only those who have responded to this invitation.  In considering applications due regard will be given to Government policy on gender balance on State Boards.The website has been updated recently to include a specific call for expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced persons for appointments to a number of positions and other vacancies will be advertised as they arise.  It is the Government's position that those proposed for appointment as Chairs of State Boards would make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas Committee.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 138, inclusive, together.There are no specific regulations governing crematoria in Ireland.  My Department is not aware of any EU Directive on crematoria, nor are there specific provisions in the Air Pollution Act 1987 that apply to crematoria. However, the establishment and operation of a crematorium would be subject, where applicable, to the provisions of certain other legislation dealing with planning and development, environmental protection and air pollution.   The provisions of the legislation on planning and environmental issues are sufficient to deal with the establishment of crematoria and I have no evidence to suggest that the matter warrants further regulation.Under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 2001, local authorities are deemed to be burial boards for their respective functional areas. Acting in their capacity as burial boards, local authorities are responsible for the management, regulation and control of burial grounds in their functional area. With the coming into effect of the Local Government Act 1994 Ministerial consent for the use of land as a burial ground is no longer required. Therefore, ensuring the adequate provision of burial facilities, in their functional areas, is entirely a matter for the relevant local authority.

Notwithstanding this, my Department is aware that debtors and financial institutions, including NAMA, are considering the best long term solutions for their sites and in some cases this may include the removal of partially constructed or vacant buildings.  This is a matter for those developers, receivers and financial institutions.

The Bill provides for a new complaints procedure whereby complaints of misconduct against solicitors and barristers will be considered and determined within an independent and transparent framework by the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal and the High Court. Where there is a finding of misconduct, provision is made under section 66(3) and (4) of the Bill for publication of determinations of the Tribunal and Orders of the High Court. The Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be able to publish such determinations and orders on a publicly accessible website.As matters stand the Law Society of Ireland provides on its website a publicly searchable database of the disciplinary records of solicitors. The database contains all findings of misconduct made by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal on or after 1 January 2004. Where the finding of misconduct is sent to the High Court for a decision on sanction the details of the High Court Order are also included in the database.The Disciplinary Code for the Bar of Ireland provides that decisions of the Barristers Professional Conduct Tribunal and the Barristers Professional Conduct Appeals Board imposing on a barrister one or more of the disciplinary measures provided for in the Code shall be published on the Bar Council website and in such other manner as it may think fit.  The General Rules of King's Inns provide that all adverse disciplinary findings where a barrister is disbarred or suspended shall be published in a transparent and searchable manner on a website maintained by the Society or other suitable publication.

His application was refused following detailed consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 12th January, 2010, that it was proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations setting out reasons why he should not be deported.  He was also advised of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.

The person concerned failed to attend as directed and was therefore classified as a person evading his deportation.On 19th April, 2005, the person concerned applied for asylum in the United Kingdom.  Once it was established by the UK immigration authorities that the person concerned had an immigration history in this State, arrangements were made to have the person concerned returned to this State.

The relevant legal representative was also advised that any such application would need to be supported by evidence of new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned or to his country of origin which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made.By letter dated 7th December, 2007, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application under Regulation 4(2) of the Subsidiary Protection Regulations.  This application was carefully considered before a decision was taken to refuse the application.  The person concerned, and his legal representative, were advised of this decision by letter dated 13th March, 2008.

Three of her children were included in her application.  Her asylum application was successful and the person concerned was issued with a formal declaration of refugee status by letter dated 27th October, 2005 with this status applying equally to her three children. This communication also advised the person concerned of the rights and entitlements accompanying refugee status in the State, one of which was that she would be permitted to reside in the State on Stamp 4 conditions.Information came to light which suggested that the grant of refugee status may have been founded on false information and as a result the person concerned was notified by letter dated 3rd July, 2009 that the then Minister was proposing to revoke her refugee status in accordance with the provisions of Section 21(1)(h) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) as it appeared that she had given false and misleading information during the course of her asylum application.  She was informed that she had 15 working days from the date of that letter to make representations to the Minister in this regard.  The person concerned made representations to the Minister within the specified period.Following the review of the case of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, the then Minister decided to revoke her status as a refugee. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 4th December, 2009.  This letter also informed her of her entitlement to appeal this decision to the High Court under Section 21(5) of the  Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  Arising from the revocation of her refugee status, the person concerned no longer enjoys the benefits accruing from refugee status in the State and therefore her permission to reside in the State, and that of her three children, under Stamp 4 conditions was withdrawn.The person concerned was notified by letter dated 15th January, 2010 that as she no longer had an entitlement to remain in the State, the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her three children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and her three children.

His asylum claim was investigated by the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  Against this background, I am satisfied that the asylum claim of the person concerned was fairly and comprehensively examined before a decision to refuse it was arrived at.  I am equally satisfied that the representations submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned, for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), were given the fullest consideration under all the relevant headings before a decision was taken to make a Deportation Order in respect of him, on 2nd December, 2005.  Overall, I am satisfied that the decision taken to deport the person concerned is justified.The person concerned remains the subject of a Deportation Order.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

The position is unchanged since then.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 16th March, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.On 2nd August, 2006, a formal "take back" request was received from the United Kingdom in respect of the person concerned in accordance with Article 16(1)(e) of Council Regulation (EC) 343 of 2003.  This request was made because the person concerned had made an application for asylum in the United Kingdom.  This request was accepted by Ireland and arrangements were made for his return from the United Kingdom to Ireland on 14th August, 2006.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	663	As is clear, while the timing of all direct aid payments to farmers is crucial, it is the Single Farm Payment that is of most importance to farmers, given that it represents in excess of €1.2 billion of the €1.7 billion that is paid out in direct aid. The SFP forms a significant part of the annual income of all farmers in Ireland, in many cases is used to subsidise the running costs of the farming enterprise and is, therefore, in certain cases greater than net farm income.The legal situation is that under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payment of the SFP cannot commence until 1 December of the scheme year and can continue to be paid up to the 30 June of the following year. However, under exceptional circumstances, the Commission are entitled, under the provisions of the EU Regulations, at the request of a Member State, to grant approval for an advance payment (50%) to be made from 16 October (the first day of the EU financial year).Earlier this year, mindful of the difficulties caused for farmers by the current financial crisis and also being acutely aware of the significance to the wider rural economy of the Single Payment, I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made. I am pleased to say that these payments will start issuing as and from next Monday, 17 October.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	667	I assume the Deputy is referring to the minimum landing size for crawfish.  Council Regulation 724/2001 requires a minimum landing size (MLS) of 95mm.  National measures were introduced in 2001 through the Crawfish (Conservation of Stocks) Order 2001 (S.I. No. 322 of 2001) which set  the MLS to 110mm for Irish fishermen so as to support the conservation of the stock which was under pressure at that time.   I am aware that certain other Member States have enacted various national MLS limits above that figure, so Ireland is not unique is taking such conservation measures.Following representations made, I am aware that continental markets have a preference for smaller crawfish and that this is presenting difficulties for Irish fishermen in maximising the economic return from their catch.  In that context, I have asked BIM in conjunction with the Marine Institute, and in consultation with crawfish fishermen and their representatives to conduct a review of the present conservation measures for crawfish and to bring forward recommendations as soon as possible.I want to see if we can find a management strategy for this species that will allow Irish inshore fishermen to compete in international markets, while stabilising the stock and ensuring its long term sustainability and bringing to an end undesirable by-catch.  The review will focus on:—the state of the crawfish stock;undesirable by-catch of non-target and possibly protected species from the use of nets by some fishermen in fishing for crawfish;the apparent market preference for smaller crawfish; andthe range of technical conservation measures for crawfish used internationally.BIM are to make recommendations on the most appropriate strategy and/or Technical Conservation Measures to address the issues specified above and to ensure that its proposals will provide at least the equivalent or a higher level of protection to the reproductive potential of the stock, as provided by the present measures, and that a high level of compliance can be assured within available resources.I will consider BIM's report and recommendations before deciding on changes, if any, to the current measures and any new measures for this fishery.  BIM advises that it will submit the report before the end of the year.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The Commission Proposal on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, COM (2011) 425 final was circulated by the European Commission on the 13th July 2011.  The Common Fisheries Policy covers all fisheries and fish stocks and there would not be a basis for excluding inshore fisheries from the Policy.  The CFP sets down the rules and regulations for the management and conservation of all fish stocks both those subject to quota restrictions covering both inshore and offshore fishing grounds and inshore stocks, many of which are not subject to quota.The proposed reformed CFP extends, to 2022, the right for Member States to restrict access in a zone within 12 nautical miles of the coastline as is currently in place.  These restrictions have reduced fishing pressure in the 12 miles zone and have provided a level of protection against increased fishing effort from other Member States within the zone.My overarching goal for the new CFP is for a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver a sustainable and eco centred fisheries landscape for future generations. I am pursuing initiatives that will deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses.I intend to continue to liaise with our industry and other stakeholders over the coming months to pursue and secure Ireland's priorities in a reformed Common Fisheries Policy.

Payment of the remaining 25% of the 2010 entitlement will also commence in the next few weeks.  Payments in respect of 2011 will commence in December.

This application was selected for and was the subject of a Ground Eligibility/Grassland Sheep Scheme Inspection.  This inspection was initiated on the 7th  of October and the results are now being processed.Under EU regulations governing the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payments Scheme all Ground Eligibility Inspections must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a Ground Eligibility Inspection.  In the vast majority of inspected cases amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the Land Parcel Identification System that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date.  Processing of these changes is continuing and priority is given to applications who were the subject of a Ground Eligibility Inspection.

Further copies of the Land Registry document were submitted to DVO officials in June 2011 and July 2011.
However, as previously indicated, the DVO has been aware for some time that there is a dispute over the ownership of the lands and the information available to the DVO is that this matter is currently before the courts. In this situation, I believe that the action taken by the DVO in registering the holding in the name of the representatives of the deceased person and assigning the role of keeper to the son of the deceased person was appropriate.  I should point out that a herd number is an administrative arrangement under the disease eradication schemes and does not denote ownership of stock or lands.  Further action on the registration of herd owner cannot take place until the issue of ownership has been resolved.

With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of an environmental plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.  The person named was written to on 1 September 2011 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on his farm.  As the necessary evidence was supplied and has now been processed, the payment due will issue in the coming days.  The 50% advance payments under the 2011 Single Payment Scheme are scheduled to commence issuing as and from 17 October 2011, with balancing payments scheduled to commence issuing as and from 1 December 2011.

In the case of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS), these rigorous procedures include a cross check with the area declared by applicants under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and recorded in the Department's Land Parcel Identification System as well as on-farm inspections to ensure that applications meet scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements. REPS and AEOS are administered from the Department's offices in Johnstown Castle, Wexford, while the SPS is administered from the offices in Portlaoise. Staff in both offices work closely on an on-going basis to resolve any issues relating to  discrepancies in the areas declared under different schemes or other relevant queries as quickly as possible.I am of course conscious of the financial pressures on many farm families and of the importance of grant payments to their incomes and cash-flow. Accordingly I have given the highest priority to the processing and payment of all scheme payments and to the elimination of all unnecessary delays in processing grant applications.

This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  This comprehensive data collection programme, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications will be dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all outstanding cases having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	687	I can assure the Deputy, and the wider farming community, that my Department is committed to allocating such resources as is necessary to ensure that the essential digitisation of applicants' maps onto the Department's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) and the processing of payments are proceeding as quickly as possible . However, I must emphasise that any failings or shortcomings in LPIS would leave the Department open to the very real risk of significant fines. I am not prepared to take such a risk, nor will I compromisethe value of direct payments to Irish farmers.
In the case of the Single Farm Payment, it should be remembered that, while the earliest payment date provided for under EU rules is 1 December, as I am particularly conscious of the difficulties caused for farmers by the current financial crisis and am also acutely aware of the significance to the wider rural economy of the Single Payment , earlier this year I successfully sought the approval of the Commissioner to have advance payments made as and from 17 October. This is the earliest possible legal date for making payments, it being the start of the new EU financial year.Following this agreement to my request for an advance payment of the SFP, I set a very demanding schedule of payments for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, with payment of DAS scheduled for 22 September, the 50% advance of the SFP scheduled for 17 October and the 50% balance of the SFP scheduled for 1 December. I am pleased to say that the DAS payments commenced on target and the payment date for the advance of the SFP will also be achieved. In all cases, my Department will continue to make multiple payment runs, under both schemes, on a weekly basis, to pay farmers as their applications become fully processed and cleared .
I fully appreciate the value and importance of these schemes to Irish farmers and remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements. I note that Ireland continues to be among the very first countries throughout the EU to be in a position to make such payments and perhaps sight should not be lost of this fact.

Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the National Disability Strategy is the cornerstone of Government policy on disability.  Launched back in September 2004, the Government recognised the need for it to be revitalised and re-focused, which is why the Programme for Government has this specific commitment: “We will publish, following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets within available resources. We will ensure whole-of-government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector”.
A whole of Government approach will be taken to the implementation process and in particular "the partnership with the disability sector”. One of the key features of the monitoring of the National Disability Strategy is the level of consultation with and direct input from the disability sector.  This will continue and actually be improved upon in the new implementation structures.A major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review. The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding, €1.5 billion, provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.As Minister for Equality, Disability, Mental Health and Older People I am committed to ensuring that the needs of our citizens who have a disability are addressed across the whole of Government.

This followed a decision in December 2008 to replace the current facility, with the allocation of capital funding for this purpose.  The Programme for Government provided for a Comprehensive Spending Review which is now well under way.  This exercise includes a review of the planned health care capital programme.   The outcomes of this review will determine the health care capital allocations for 2012 and future years.The Irish Medicines Board reports annually to me on the results of its inspections of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In its 2010 Report the Irish Medicines Board has stated that, in its opinion, the provision of a purpose built facility is the only resolution that can ensure compliance of the Munster Regional Transfusion Centre with modern requirements of a transfusion service, which are in keeping with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).  I am aware that some administrative/medical staff have recently been relocated to more modern office space and this has no implications for product safety.

However, if a child needs hospital care, the HSE will provide this.I am committed to ensure that there should be a particular focus on protecting services to vulnerable groups.  In 2011 the Government gave favourable treatment to disability services by setting a lower savings target for disability services of a maximum budget reduction of 1.8%.  As is the case with all charities, the HSE is not in a position to provide additional funding to compensate for a drop in their private fund-raising income.

I would like to reassure the Deputy that all our efforts in health reform will continue to be centred on the people who need health services.The  National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority, and approved by the Minister for Health, clearly outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a resident, their family, a carer, or the public can expect to receive in residential care settings.  The standards deal with the areas of rights of older people, protection, health and social care needs, quality of life, staffing, the care environment, and management and governance.  Standard 11 is of particular relevance to the Deputy’s question as it provides that “the arrangements to meet each resident’s assessed needs are set out in an individual care plan, developed and agreed with each resident, or in the case of a resident with cognitive impairment with his/her representative.” Article 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, underpins this standard. The Article states, amongst other things that” the person in charge shall ensure each resident’s needs are set out in an individual care plan developed and agreed with each resident.

To qualify, the GP must produce evidence of payment of medical indemnity insurance.(Circular 1/92 dated 10th January 1992; revised in Circular 5/96 dated 22 July 1996).The Contract makes provision for payments for locum cover while a GP is on leave (Circular 4/89 dated April 1989), including annual leave (revised in Circular dated 5th June 1997) and study leave (revised in Circular 2/90 dated 2 February 1990 and Circular 2/95 dated 6th February 1995).The Contract makes provision for the payment of subsidies towards the cost of employing practice nurses, secretaries and managers (revised in Circular dated 7th June 1995; Circular 6/96 dated 23rd July 1996; Circular dated 5th June 1997; Circular dated April 1998; Circular dated 31st July 2001; and Circular dated 8th April 2002.)In 1993, the Government agreed to the establishment of a General Practice Development Fund (Circular 1/93 dated 6th January 1993).The following payments were made to GPs out of the fund:1. Payments for the provision of rostering and out-of-hours arrangements.2. Payments towards practice maintenance, equipment and development.3. A supplementary grant to employ practice nurses and secretaries.Under the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2010, separate payments under these headings are no longer made.  Under the Contract, GPs are eligible for a Rural Practice Allowance when he/she lives and practices in an area with a population of less than 500, where there is not a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a three mile radius of that centre and where the HSE considers it necessary to pay an Allowance to retain a doctor in the area.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address the other aspects of the Deputy's questions, including information which is not provided by the HSE to my Department as a matter of routine, and I will convey this information to the Deputy as soon as I have received it.

Reach Out  — the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 — 2014) provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  It calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour involving health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.  The total funding available nationally through the HSE for suicide prevention is  about €9 million of which €4.1 million is available to the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) and approximately €5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives including crisis awareness groups.This Government has prioritised the reform of the mental health service in line with A Vision for Change and Reach Out.  This commitment was clearly shown in the Programme for Government which provides that €35 million will be ring-fenced annually from within the overall health budget to develop community mental health services, ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children and to implement Reach Out  .  This is currently being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2012 and future years.Provisional figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that there were 55 deaths by suicide in Counties Cavan, Meath, Louth and Monaghan in 2009 and 46 in 2010.  There were 19 deaths by suicide in Fingal in 2009 and 18 in 2010.  Data on Self-Harm presentations to Emergency Departments is compiled and published on an annual basis by the National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF).   The number of presentations of deliberate self-harm to Emergency Departments in the North East was 2,991 in 2009 and 2,800 in 2010.

Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

These funds are provided to support projects run by community groups and voluntary organisations in the provision of health and personal social services throughout the country.  The Deputy will be aware that funding from National Lottery proceeds are also allocated to other Departments for a range of projects including youth, sport, recreation and amenities, culture and heritage and the Irish language. At a time of severe restraints on public expenditure, it is the view of the Government that where funding is available from other sources, then it should be utilised to ensure the continued support for these worthwhile projects.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	714	The HSE South this morning issued a press statement in relation to the re-location of orthopaedic services from St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital to the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital.  Work on this programme began in May 2010 and it is expected that the transfer will take place in December 2011. The transfer includes elective in-patient, rehabilitation trauma and day surgery. Trauma and emergency orthopaedic surgery will continue to be provided in Cork University Hospital.As the Deputy is aware, there has been considerable engagement with staff and key stakeholders in relation to the transfer of services. I believe that this process has been crucial and will greatly facilitate the new developments that are to be implemented.   I reviewed this proposal earlier this year and I have made it clear that health services will continue to be provided at St. Mary's, including mental health, maternity outpatient and ambulances services, a health centre and residential provision for community nursing and intellectual disability. In addition, extra services will be made available at the St. Mary's campus, such as an Urgent Care Centre linked to the Mercy Hospital. The HSE is also examining the potential for locating a new primary care centre on the St. Mary's site, to service the population of the north west of Cork city, and is in discussion with local GPs on this.I am convinced that these developments will result in a greatly enhanced health service in Cork and Kerry region.  I have arranged for the Communications Directorate of the HSE South to email its press statement to the Deputy, which contains details of the relocation.

The amendment was agreed subject to assurances from the HSE that:individuals with complex cases will not be disadvantaged,average processing times for complete applications should not exceed 4-6 weeks,geographical location will not disadvantage applicants, andacute hospitals will not be detrimentally affected, subject to the scheme being operated within the financial resources allocated.The HSE's Guidelines now state that, subject to overall resources, people who enter nursing homes will have their financial support paid either from the date that the application is approved, or date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.  It should be noted that the amendment will have no retrospective effect, will be reviewed in one year and will only apply to applications received after the 1st October 2011.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-13 00:00:00	Prelude	717	Under the former Eastern Health Board, it was the practice to provide psychiatric medicines free to all patients who attended an outpatient clinic for services regardless of their eligibility status. Such arrangements were unique to the greater Dublin area. In all other former Health Board Areas, patients used either their medical card or Drug Payment Scheme card to access psychiatric medicines.In 2009, the HSE decided to bring the arrangements for the supply of medicines to patients attending mental health outpatient clinics in the greater Dublin area into line with those operating in the rest of the country. These changes were introduced on a phased basis, starting on 1 October 2010 when medical card holders in the HSE Dublin North East area requiring psychiatric medicines were referred to their own GP for a GMS prescription. This arrangement is being extended to the Dublin Mid Leinster area from 1 November 2011. At the same time, Drug Payment Scheme cardholders will be required to pay for their prescription up to theco-payment threshold of €120 per month. Medical card holders will continue to receive their medication free of charge, subject to any applicable prescription charge.  These arrangements will be kept under review.People affected by these changes who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive will take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family, including the cost of medication.

Ms Jupp, Mr. Bonner, Mr. Mallee and Mr. Gaffney all appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 12 July 2011.Mr. Tom Wall was appointed as Chairperson of the RPA on an interim basis to the 18/04/2012 pending the merger of the RPA and the National Roads Authority next year. Given the short nature of his appointment, it was not considered necessary for him to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The Chairperson for the merged body will be designated in advance of the completion of the merger and will appear before the Committee prior to his/her appointment.Furthermore, I have proposed that Mr. Gay Byrne be re-appointed as Chairperson of the Road Safety Authority. However, he is required to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Com-mittee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht before that re-appointment will take effect. I understand that he is due to appear before the Committee on the 15th of November 2011.The table lists the remuneration which applies to Board members. Expense arrangements are a day to day matter for the agencies.My Department advertised in the National press on Friday 8th April 2011 and on the Department's website for expressions of interest from individuals who wished to serve as Chairpersons of CIE and of its subsidiary companies or, as vacancies arise, in any board capacity on any of the State agencies for which I have responsibility.

It is not the practice of my Department to subsidise shipping routes, nor are there any funds available to my Department for this purpose. The subsidisation of loss-making ferry services across the board would result in significant financial costs to the state, and moreover, could potentially result in other transportproviders being disadvantaged. I understand that in the past Donegal County Council under the Department of Environment Heritage and Local Government along with the UK authorities provided some funding for ferry services on Lough Foyle.

I understand that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 makes it an offence for a trader to engage in a misleading commercial practice, which would include the provision of false information in relation to a products usage or prior history, to the extent that the information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the consumer would not otherwise make.  I understand that the National Consumer Agency enforces this legislation and provides advice for prospective buyers in its Guide to Buying a Car. The issue of further legislation in this area is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation.
