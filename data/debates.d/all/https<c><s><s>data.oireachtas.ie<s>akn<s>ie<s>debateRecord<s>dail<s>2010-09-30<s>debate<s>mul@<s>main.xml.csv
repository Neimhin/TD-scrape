Even before these cuts, the county's mental health services had been devastated with the departure and non-replacement of 60 experienced nurses.  Another attack on home help hours, or should I say home help minutes, is taking place behind closed doors.  Although reassurances were given regarding the protection of front-line services, this is not happening and some answers are needed.

Ireland wakes up this morning to another national crisis.  People find themselves owning another bank when most people only wish to own their own homes.  The Order of Business as presented by the Government is a typical response that constitutes business as usual.  However, it is not business as usual.  While the Taoiseach never has had any willingness to change the manner in which this House does its business, now is the time for real action in the context of what is a national crisis.  This morning, the Minister for Finance stated that the people could rightly be angry at bankers who had involved themselves in reckless lending practices.  People also should be and are very angry at the political process that allowed this to happen.  I saw a report the other day of a man who was jailed for the non-payment of a fine of €250.  However, one sees what happens both here and abroad, with people who were involved with Anglo Irish Bank and in other reckless lending practices swanning around as though it were business as usual.The situation with which we are faced today means that the banking strategy pursued by the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is now in shreds.  This banking strategy has closed Ireland off to the markets and now is a clear indication beyond yea or nea——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The credibility of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in respect of banking strategy is now in tatters.  I am appalled at the number of cases I have already encountered this morning of people who are concerned that lending practices will now become even tighter and that credit will not be extended to business with obvious consequential difficulties.  However, for the Government to say we can have a debate in the House until 3.30 p.m. without allowing for any questions or capacity to tease out what is a national crisis is incredible.  I propose that we do not accept the proposed Order of Business and that the time be extended until at least 6 p.m. and that time possibly be allowed tomorrow.  Every single Member, be he from Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Labour Party or Sinn Féin, or an Independent, is entitled to his say on what the Taoiseach has led us into.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This is not a time for hysterical reaction, nor is it a time for a panic-stricken reaction.  The fundamental problem that the Government now faces and in which it has landed the country is that even if it produces four-year fiscal or banking plans or four-year growth projections, they will have no credibility.  They will be treated in the same way by the markets as the Taoiseach's announcement only two days ago of creating 300,000 jobs.  The proposal is built on a basis of shadows.  The Taoiseach is tying the next Government into circumstances based on his attempts to make fiscal projections for four years ahead.The Fine Gael banking policy outlined for the past two years has now proven to be correct yet again.  Time and again, the Government has rejected all proposals that were constructive, costed and in the interest of Ireland, getting people back to work and restoring the confidence of the people.  We set out those strategies,——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	17	That point can be made in the debate later.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	18	——costed them and circulated them.  We made our case about subordinated bond investors taking a portion of the hit.  We need to tease out the Government's view on senior bondholders and the terms that are to be negotiated.  The Minister for Finance was quite circumspect about this matter this morning.This is a most serious set of circumstances, catastrophic for many.  The Government seems to believe it is business as usual but it is not.  For that reason, I propose, in the interest of our country and people, that we now have a rational debate on what we must do to pull the country back from the brink of the economic cliff to which it has been led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the rest of the Government owing to their failed banking strategy.  The failure of the banking strategy is now threatening Ireland.  We need to stand up and do something about it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I ask Deputies to remember that there is a proposal to have a full-scale debate later during statements.  There will be time during Private Members' business.  There will be ample time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	20	No, there will not be ample time — that is the whole problem.  The proposal from the Government is that the statements on the statement made officially by the Minister for Finance this morning on the full cost of the banking bailout should conclude at 3.30 p.m. today.  This means that, in effect, the Government is proposing that the Dáil be given between two hours and 2.5 hours to discuss the biggest Bill that any Government has ever introduced.  There is no reason statements should end at 3.30 p.m. or why they could not continue tomorrow during a sitting of the House.  There is no reason the item cannot remain on the Order Paper until every single Member of the Dáil who wants to make a contribution does so.  There is no parliamentary reason for a time limit on this debate.  Statements can be continued until the opportunity is given to every Member to contribute.  They can be worked into the schedule of the Dáil next week, the week after or later until every Member has the opportunity of contributing.  If ever there were a case for this to apply, it is in this case.  We are talking about the biggest sum of money we have ever talked about.The focus is understandably on Anglo Irish Bank, in respect of which we are told the total required will be between €29.3 billion and €34.3 billion.  However, when one adds in the recapitalisation money for all the other banks, one will note that the total is between approximately €45 billion and €50 billion.  We are a long way from the circumstances that obtained when the Minister for Finance told us on 24 October 2008 that the bank bailout was the cheapest in the world.  We have now been told the final bill.  This is the price of failure.  It is the price of the property bubble, of the light regulation that Fianna Fáil has presided over, of bad government and of the blanket bank guarantee.  It is the bill that Fianna Fáil is leaving to the people of this country.  It amounts to between €45 billion and €50 billion.It is not acceptable for the Government, on leaving that bill to the people, to give Members until 3.30 p.m. today to say their piece on it.  It is no more acceptable than the dishonest way that the Taoiseach dealt with the question yesterday when I asked him if he knew what the figure was.  He said he did not and that the Financial Regulator had not given it to him yet, but that we might be able to have a Dáil debate about it.  We were hardly outside the door when we discovered an article on the Financial Times website based on an interview given by the Minister for Finance, which interview he had to have given before he came into the House at 7 p.m. yesterday.  Most of the information that was eventually announced publicly this morning was signalled in that interview.  That is, at the very least, discourtesy to the Dáil.I formally propose an amendment to the Government's proposal this morning to prevent the conclusion of the motion at 3.30 p.m.  It should be left open-ended such that we can return to it.  If we want to sit tomorrow, we will be able to return to tomorrow.  Otherwise we can continue next week and reschedule the statements until every single Member of the House has an opportunity to speak on it.

The Government clearly has no shame.  Yesterday evening it rushed through an extension of the bank guarantee scheme before the full information on the expected level of support necessary to rescue Anglo Irish Bank or deal with the outrageous conduct of those who were entrusted with its stewardship over many years was made available.  Regarding Anglo Irish Bank alone, the sum required amounts to up to €34 billion.This morning on "Morning Ireland", the Minister of Finance said——

It is laughable only because of how serious this matter is, what we are actually facing and the impact it is having on the lives of ordinary people.  This is an absolute disgrace.  I disagree with my colleagues who have spoken on the proposed statements.  It is not a question of having more time for statements and having everybody make his contribution while the Government sits there without backbenchers having even to exercise a defence of what is taking place through being called upon to vote in favour of it.  It is not statements we want; we need a debate.  We need a proposition.  We need to be sure that all Members on the Government side of the House, from both Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, really believe what their Cabinet has been putting forward yesterday and today and what it will clearly put forward in the future.  We do not want statements but decisions to be made in the interest of the people and the record to show this clearly.We have no confidence in this proposition.  It is a whitewash to give cover to the Government on foot of what it did yesterday and what it is now proposing to do once again.  This morning the Sinn Féin Deputies tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Having given careful thought and long consideration to the matter, we have had to come to that decision.  There can be no other mealy-mouthed way about it.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Taoiseach and their colleagues have not been upfront with the Members of this House.  They have withheld critical information that would have been relevant and important to decisions we were asked to make on the floor of this Chamber.  This goes back to 30 September 2008 when the full information in regard to Anglo Irish Bank was not shared with the elected representatives of the people in this House when the Minister sought the initial green light for the bank guarantee scheme.Two years later, there can be no confidence in this Government's further efforts to lead the Irish people into financial destruction, which is where it is bringing us.  It is with regret that we have been forced to take this decision, but we have had to do it.  We are calling on the other Opposition voices in this House to facilitate the opportunity to take that motion forward onto the floor of this House where we can debate it.  We will not accept this proposition.  It is an absolute whitewash, and this Government is a total disgrace.  What we need is for the Government to go before the people at the earliest possible opportunity so that they can decide.  It is time for the Government to go.  We need new policies, new direction and new leadership.

That can be organised by the Whips in terms of extending the debate beyond Question Time today for several hours or arranging for it to be dealt with next week.  Usually if there is a question and answer session under these situations, it is at the end of statements.  What Deputy English wants is a few statements, a few questions and answers, a few statements and so on.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Deputy English must resume his seat.  I have called Deputy Gilmore.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I acknowledge and thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to the suggestion by Deputy Kenny and me that the debate be extended to allow everybody in the House an opportunity to contribute.  The Taoiseach said that the arrangements can be agreed by the Whips.  I hope he will also agree that in making those arrangements, the Whips will be enabled to make suitable arrangements for questions and answers between the Minister and Members of the House.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	63	As I said, I am anxious to facilitate an extension of time for statements, but whether that will mean everybody in the House will have an opportunity to speak I cannot predict.  The Government has business to conduct in addition to this business.  I take the point that if the House wishes to have statements beyond what is in the Order Paper for this particular business, we can arrange for that through the agreement of the Whips.  We can also arrange for a question and answer session, which usually takes place at the end of statements.

I fully support the case for every Deputy, including the Independents, having the chance to participate.  However, it is not about the numbers of statements.  It is about whether statements of themselves are the appropriate way to address this matter.  We in Sinn Féin do not believe they are.  If the Government——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	65	We cannot have a Second Stage debate on this matter.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	67	We have made considerable progress on the arrangements for the debate.

Let them put their name to a decision here and not merely fill the air with statements which, in the end of the day——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I have asked the Deputy to co-operate with the Chair.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	71	We have a proposal, as outlined by the Taoiseach at the beginning of the Order of Business.  Is that agreed to in principle, subject to the amended proposal to be agreed by the Whips later?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	72	It is not agreed.  It does not go far enough.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	73	We now move on to Private Members' business, motion re economic strategy (resumed).

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	80	In regard to this morning's events, I believe the Government gambled a banking strategy which it has now lost.  The problem is that the taxpayer has paid——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Deputy will have ample time to make these points later on.  She will have practically all day to make them.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I want to ask the Taoiseach a number of specifics about the material that has been put up on various Government press and agency sites——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Has the Taoiseach or his Government had discussions with the European Commission specifically in regard to the raised figure of the deficit which the Minister for Finance stated may possibly reach 32%?  Will the Taoiseach advise or arrange to advise the House or the Opposition on how the European Commission and other European agencies propose to treat with that incredible level of deficit which will be recording at the end of this year?I want also to ask the Taoiseach whether it remains the position of Government, in respect of senior debt, which has been put at some €30 billion plus, which came free of the guarantee last night——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The Deputy is into detail, which will be dealt with during the debate.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	94	These are major Government statements, not about future programmes of Government but in regard to how the country manages to survive this.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I have advised the Deputy that she will have ample opportunity to make those points later on.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The Deputy cannot pose that question at this time.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The resolution mechanism mentioned in the statement is promised legislation.  It is the most important legislation that we never got since the beginning of our trouble with the banks.  May I explain that to the Ceann Comhairle?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Yes but the only question the Deputy is allowed to ask is when the legislation will come forward.  The Deputy is not allowed to make Second Stage contributions in the context of her query.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Now that the country is in mortal peril, perhaps the Taoiseach will say if he has given consideration, as previously requested by me of the Minister for Finance, to the situation that existed in England prior to the general election, namely, that the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance and I, as spokesperson on finance for the Labour Party, along with other spokespersons on finance, would have a direct line to a senior person in the Department of Finance?  This happened for George Osborne and Vince Cable in the run up to the British general election, namely, the Opposition were given the detailed figures and were in a position, free of whatever take the serving Government — in this case the British Labour Party — had on the figures or their expectations in terms of what they hoped to do with their policies.  Will the Government undertake to give us the figures spokesperson to spokesperson, in confidence?
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Will the Deputy be constructive?

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I have asked the Deputy to resume her seat.  If there are any aspects of the queries the Taoiseach can reply to, he will do so.  Deputy Burton is anticipating the debate, which will be ongoing all day.  The Deputy is ticking off her questions at this point.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	114	My question is not for the debate at all.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	120	He has not briefed the Opposition at any stage, which is deeply regrettable because we are fielding media queries on Ireland from around the world and are trying to do our best by Ireland.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I hope so.

I was expecting that legislation to be announced yesterday in the legislative programme.  When will that legislation come before the House?  We were told it would be introduced this term.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The National Property Services Regulatory Authority, a €3 million quango, is now four years old but still has no statutory powers.  The authority is supposed to regulate property management agents but is not currently achieving its objectives.  Staff at the authority are twiddling their thumbs.  This is yet another example of the Government burning taxpayers' money.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Has legislation been promised in this area?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I understand the report has been published and is currently being consulted on with local interests.

First, however, I will remind the House of the quality and standard of service Members receive at present.  This issue relates to the Order of Business.  I asked the Minister for Health and Children——

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I wish to share time with Deputy McManus.Last night was a sad occasion in this House when the Government forced through a vote which extended by another three months the blanket guarantee that had been operating for two years.  This morning we see the extent of the guarantee and its effects on the economy — Ireland inc., so to speak — and taxpayers.  The cost of the bailout will be at least €46 billion, the deficit has shot up to more than 32% and one of our major banks is to be nationalised.  We find ourselves in a very sad position.The Labour Party opposed the blanket guarantee from the beginning.  Having opposed the pig in a poke, we now see what is in it, even if all tranches of the various portfolios have not yet been transferred to the National Asset Management Agency.  The policy adopted over the past two years has resulted in an unemployment rate of 13.7% or 450,000 people, the emigration of more than 100,000 young people, a decline in gross national product of 20% and a further sharp dip into recession in the second quarter of 2010.  These developments provide all the more reason for the Government to concentrate on a strategy for the economy and jobs.  What we are seeing, however, is a Government with its face turned in the other direction.We, on these benches, have repeatedly argued that the most important policy should be one to deal with small and medium sized enterprises.  Every time the Government introduces a new element of its strategy, the main thrust is either to recapitalise the banks or to ensure they provide a credit flow to small and medium enterprises.  As the Minister for Finance has indicated again and again, the latter forms part of the bank guarantee and NAMA process.  There has not been a credit flow.The small and medium enterprise sector provides 50% of jobs and 65% of all private employment, yet the Government does not have a strategy to retain existing jobs or promote expansion in a sector that is crying out for credit.  The banks have not been able to provide credit and refuse to borrow from the European Investment Bank to do so within the parameters set down for expanding existing enterprises and establishing new enterprises.  The Government has been in complete derogation of its duty in this respect.The Labour Party proposes the establishment of a strategic investment bank using the National Pensions Reserve Fund to ensure that the SME sector, the lifeblood of the economy, is given the credit it requires.  Every Member of the House has received letters from representatives of the retail sector in this city and around the country stating that it is being bled dry by the rise in commercial rents.  In the past 12 months alone, 35,000 jobs have been lost in retail.  Representatives of the sector argue that 80,000 jobs could be created if the Government reversed legislation providing that rent reviews for commercial leases may only be upward.  This is a simple matter but the Government has not addressed it.The Government's policy document, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy: A Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, does not say a word about either of the sectors in which major job creation can take place.  It will not be possible to get out of the economic mire without job creation and the key to achieving this will be to increase consumer spending and confidence.  This cannot be done without a stimulus in the economy.What is the main proposal with regard to the new quango, the foreign trade council, the Government announced last Tuesday?  The new body will meet twice annually, will be chaired by a junior Minister, will not have a budget and will oversee the production of annual reports from heads of mission or ambassadors in overseas countries.  That was the main thrust of the Government's economic policy.  It is ridiculous that this is all it has to offer after such a long period of recession.The Government hopes to increase employment in the tourism industry by 15,000 and will magically restore the 2007 tourism figures when 30 million people passed through our airports from a current figure of less than 20 million.  How will this objective be achieved when an air traffic tax which imposes a burden on the airlines bringing passengers to this country has been introduced in the meantime?  Surely in a recession, one does not want to establish obstacles for visitors coming here and spending significant sums of money.  No ideas, even one as simple as that, are coming through.  Retention of existing jobs, job creation, promoting consumer confidence and getting consumers to spend again are essential if we are to solve our problems.  If we do not do this we will continue in the mire.Listening to the Minister for Finance at his press conference this morning, I heard no sign of anything other than satisfying the international market.  The Minister is satisfying the international market with all these austerity measures and with the old mantra of ensuring stability in the banking system, which of course we have not succeeded in doing, but where are the policies that will get the wheels of the economy moving?  That is what this Private Members' motion is about and what we should be concentrating on.  That is what is missing in the Government's strategy.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I thank Deputy Costello for sharing his time.  I am also grateful that we are taking the opportunity to debate the issue of jobs and economic growth.  We have a Government that is fixated on the banking crisis, which was created largely by its own incompetence and ideology.  We have a mammoth task of ensuring that we get people back to work and grow our economy.One of the areas mentioned in the Labour Party amendment is broadband, on which I want to concentrate.  Broadband is as important to this generation as electricity was to a previous one, in terms of providing the capacity and capability for economic growth, yet Ireland is currently in the bottom five OECD countries in terms of broadband performance.  We have to deal with this.  These are not the conditions in which we would choose to do so but we have got to deal with this basic infrastructural requirement.  It is not being dealt with.I was taken aback to learn that only a minority of small and medium enterprises actually trade on the Internet.  I am conscious of a divide in the country.  There are many areas where broadband is either not available or only available at a huge price or an unacceptable speed.The privatisation of Eircom was a disaster.  I believe the company is now trying to address some of the major issues it faces in a competent way.  However, we cannot simply rely on the market.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, speaks about the smart economy with next generation networks and assures us it is up to the market to develop this.  The market has failed and, in fact, the Government has failed.  We appreciate that financial resources are not there in the way they were in the past, but that does not absolve any Government from confronting the issue of broadband development and ensuring that we have next generation broadband.  If we do not, we will be unable to compete with countries that are developing, whether through the markets, because they are more developed and more competitive, or through State investment.

Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh deis againn cursaí fostaíochta a phlé.  I would like to praise the Fine Gael Party for putting down a very important motion.  I may not agree with the terms of the motion but the question of growth in the economy and jobs is central to the issues faced by ordinary people every day.The Government continues to focus on the issue of jobs and has made them central to its policies.  The negativity and pessimism that pervades Irish society will not create a single job.  Experience tells us one of the first requirements in building an economy is people believing in the future.Significant progress has been made despite the huge challenges we face.  The value of exports in July was up by 12% compared with July 2009.  Service exports for the first half of this year were 8% higher than the corresponding period of 2009.  These are very encouraging figures which show that our export sector is now coming back to strong growth as our economy stabilises.  We expect economic growth to take hold more widely as we go into next year.  Our Exchequer finances are on track.  Consumer price inflation has been lower than that in the euro area for the last few years.  This is contributing to competitiveness, which underpins growth and will assist future job creation.The drop in the September live register announced yesterday is a positive outcome and is fully consistent with what I have been saying for some months, namely that the live register is stabilising.  However, levels of unemployment are still very high and our overriding priority in government is to drive forward the process of economic recovery and to create new jobs and opportunities to get people back to work.The figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that the live register September headline figure was 442,417, which is 24,506 below the August 2010 total.  The month-on-month decrease of 24,506 is the biggest fall ever recorded in any one month.  The previous biggest fall in a single month was 17,307 recorded in September 2006.  The live register seasonally adjusted figure was 449,600.  This is a decrease of 5,400, or 1.2%, on August 2010.  The year-on-year increase is dropping every week.  While we are far from where we would like to be, significant continuous progress is being made.  The CSO labour force survey also shows that more than 62,000 people on the live register are in part-time employment.  Of course, we would like to get as many of those people as possible back to a five day week, but they are not totally disconnected from the workplace.It has been said that the Government is concentrating on the bank issue.  Of course, for the economy to flourish it is imperative that we fix our banking system, restore order to the public finances, regain our competitiveness and create jobs.  We are working on a multi-faceted approach to creating jobs and stimulating growth.  Under the leadership of An Taoiseach we are undertaking a number of key strategic initiatives, including the announcement on Monday of the Government's five year integrated plan for trade, tourism and investment aimed at generating 300,000 jobs and boosting exports by one third.  With this initiative we are positioning Ireland to be even more successful in the sale of our goods and services, attracting more visitors to come to our island to experience our magnificent tourism offering first hand and winning further global investment.  This plan will strengthen Ireland's trade links.  While the US, UK and our eurozone partners will continue to be key markets for us, this plan aims to dramatically increase the number of exporting firms and diversify the destination of indigenous exports into new high-growth markets.Our other specific measures to create jobs include the €40 billion capital investment plan launched by An Taoiseach in July.  Innovation Fund Ireland, from which €500 million is available, will support enterprise development and job creation by attracting top venture capitalists to Ireland.  During the next five years, €360 million will be invested in research and innovation.  The latter will involve third level institutions and will help to create new jobs and enterprises and drive Ireland's economic recovery.  Last week, the Government launched a new strategy to expand international student numbers dramatically.Under the employment subsidy scheme, we are investing over €130 million to assist more than 1,600 exporting firms to keep 80,000 workers in jobs.  We announced an additional €55 million investment in August to give early-stage entrepreneurs capital for their businesses.  The back to work enterprise allowance aims to encourage the long-term unemployed to develop businesses, while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their social welfare payments.  At the end of August, 6,646 people were availing of the scheme.Some €169 million is also being provided by my Department for the back to education allowance scheme in respect of the current academic year.  Practical changes to ease its qualifying conditions came in to effect from Monday, 19 July.  The additional €12 million provided for the labour market activation fund, which was announced in August, will bring the total number of places supported by the fund to over 11,000 in 2010.  Finally, the employer job PRSI incentive scheme is focused on creating new jobs for people who have been on the live register for six months or more.In the context of discussing the Government amendment to the motion, I wish like to focus on the latter scheme.  The employer job PRSI incentive scheme provides a direct stimulus for the real economy by reducing costs for employers and shifting the balance in favour of job creation.  It is an important measure in tackling unemployment because it cuts business input costs and incentivises employers to take workers off the live register as Ireland emerges from recession and the economy begins to recover.  The scheme is supporting job creation in a very practical way.  It saves each employer in the region of €3,000 or more per annum with regard to the cost of employing an additional worker.  It is an exemption scheme.  Unlike many schemes under which grants are paid out and then recouped, savings are made immediately on the basis of the exemption because employers are not obliged to pay the PRSI to the State.Any job created in 2010 which meets the criteria relating to the scheme can benefit from the exemption.  If an employer created a new job prior to the launch of the scheme in June, he or she may still qualify for an exemption of employer's PRSI in respect of it.  I am aware that Fine Gael supports this scheme.  If I am correct, it suggested the establishment of the scheme at this time last year.  If an employer qualifies for the exemption, it will be for 12 months from the date they are approved for the scheme.As already stated, this measure is deliberately targeted at those who have been unemployed for six months or more.  The proportion of people who return to employment after a short period out of work remains relatively high.  After six months on the live register, however, there is a danger that people will drift into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency.The Government's employment strategy is as much about creating new jobs as it is about supporting unemployed workers in order that they can re-enter the labour force as the economy improves.  Our training programmes and extra places in further and higher education are reskilling the workforce to take up new jobs in growth areas of the economy.  We are hugely committed to creating jobs in the competitive economy.  That is the Government's first and foremost priority and it is the key focus of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.One of the priorities I have been given in my Department is job activation.  The various experts agree that the increase in employment will lag behind economic growth to some degree.  During the period of this timelag, it is important that we should examine innovative way of giving as many people as possible the opportunity to work and provide necessary services in our communities.  I have already indicated that I will be making a firm announcement in this regard in the coming weeks.Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, is í fadhb na dífhostaíochta an fhadhb is mó go bhfuil go leor daoine ag stracadh leí.  Cruthaíonn an dífhostaíocht fadhbanna i measc an phobail ó thaobh easpa oibre, easpa ioncaim agus easpa rud le déanamh.  Cruthaíonn sí fadhbanna freisin ó thaobh morgáistí.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is rún an-thábhachtach í an rún atá os ár gcomhair inniu.  Baineann an rún leis an dífhostaíocht, an eacnamaíocht agus straitéis an Rialtais chun rudaí a chur chun cinn sa tír seo.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue.  The Opposition's main focus is attacking the Government and highlighting the problems that exist.  Deputies are aware of those problems because they are exposed to them each day in their constituency offices.  We are well aware of the difficulties unemployment causes for individuals, families and the State.  We know what the problems are and we know that we have to find a solution to them.The Government has put in place a range of solutions, ideas, plans and strategies.  For many months, we have been accused of having no plan.  When the Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy strategy was announced earlier in the week, however, we were accused of rehashing old plans.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  I am glad that the new strategy has been put in place.  The State agencies are at the cutting edge of attracting employment.  It is our duty and responsibility and their duty, responsibility and privilege to attract as much foreign direct investment as possible.  Those in the employ of the State agencies, who are very able people, want to work to the best of their ability.  The targets they have been set are both exacting and necessary.  I am sure they will be achieved.  I have every confidence in the agencies.  In recent days, many naysayers, including those on the Opposition benches, have asked what these agencies know about jobs.  I am of the view that they are at the cutting edge in that regard.There are a number of aspects of the Fine Gael motion I would support.  It refers, for example, to the reform of the bankruptcy laws.  What would be the reaction of Fine Gael or Labour if we were to propose such reform?  The first accusation to be made would be to the effect that we were bailing out Seán FitzPatrick.  However, when the proposal is put forward by Fine Gael, it is seen as reasonable.  Those opposite will always try to highlight the bad news stories and accuse us of trying to do something for the few rather than the many.  Fianna Fáil has always been about the many, not the few.  When we introduce bankruptcy reform legislation, we will look forward to the full support of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I am sure at that stage we will not be accused of trying to assist the few and that the Opposition will recognise that our aim will be to try to encourage people to take reasonable risks in the future.On occasion I am obliged to question why we do not use more money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to assist capital infrastructure projects, particularly those relating to broadband services, school building projects and road development programmes.  The Government has a massive capital investment programme in place but this is not acknowledged by the Opposition, which almost acts as if it does not exist.  I have always been of the view that moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be invested in capital projects.  I accept that such projects would have to realise a return on such investment, either through charges for broadband or road tolls.  In addition, some form of public private partnership should apply in respect of school building projects.  However, we would then be faced with all the usual complaints and motions in the House with regard to why people would be obliged to pay such charges and tolls.  The answer in this regard is that any investment must be paid back and that a return for the taxpayer must be achieved.The Government is doing everything possible in the current climate.  It has been hit by the greatest financial crisis in the history of the State.  In addition, Europe has been struck by the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s.  Governments have found it difficult to react and to identify what needs to be done.  The Irish Government is no exception in that regard and has encountered real difficulties.  However, I am of the view that it has risen to the challenge.  People are beginning to realise that and to lose heart with regard to the shrill rhetoric which accompanies opposition at all costs.  The apotheosis of the latter occurred earlier in the week when, for purely political reasons, the Tánaiste was almost prevented from travelling abroad in order to try to attract jobs to this country.Jobs are the focus of the Government.  The attraction and creation of jobs lie at the heart of what it is doing.  We will not be in a position to attract or create employment until the uncertainty relating to the banks has been resolved.  It would not be possible to attract further foreign direct investment if, as the Opposition parties wanted us to do last night, we were to suspend the bank guarantee scheme or allow it to lapse.I am glad to fully support the Government in respect of its banking and economic policies.  While we do not like what we have to do, we know it is essential for the future of the country that we get finality to the banking crisis and keep foreign direct investment coming in.  Public representatives and public servants need to work together to the best of our abilities to get people working again.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate initiated by the Opposition.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, there are elements in the Fine Gael motion that we all support.  Everybody in this House is very much aware of the jobs crisis that exists.  While we all have different ideas, we all support the notion of creating employment.  Fundamental to the restoration of jobs and growth in the country is having an effective banking system that will provide access to cash at realistic interest rates for businesses to be able to employ people and for individuals to be able to live their lives in an ordinary way.  We do not have that at the moment.  Clearly, the lack of credit is retarding growth and in many cases leading to job losses.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are not in a position to get adequate credit to continue their businesses.  I would hope that today's announcement will signal finality——

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	188	——to the serious measures taken by the Government, which with some limited support from the other side can bring some order to the banking situation.  Clearly, it is vital that the banks are stable, well financed and capitalised in a manner that will enable support for our economy.  We need to bring closure as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the very considerable costs to the taxpayer.  It is vital for the future survival of the economy to have those banks supporting viable business.  Members on all sides have met people who have lost their jobs because their employers have been unable to get credit.  There are many non-viable enterprises that will not survive what was the bubble, but there are those that are viable and have the potential to sustain employment, and we need to get behind them.The members of the alternative government are at odds on how the banking system can be restored to a healthy position.  Last night, there were some suggestions from Fine Gael that the extension of the guarantee was the right thing but it could not find it in its heart to support it on some minor technical issue.

Thankfully, there were enough people who were responsible enough and prepared to take the tough decision to approve the scheme last night.There is considerable talk about jobs, but some people refuse to engage in the fundamental questions of how to resolve the banking crisis in a manner that ensures that jobs can be created.  It is very well to talk about the past and who was to blame.  Everybody must accept their responsibility in that regard and I, as a member of my party, am happy to take the blame apportioned in that regard.  However, that does not allow us to hide from the fact that we now have a responsibility and duty to put things right.  Attempting to hide behind some fictitious suggestion that somehow all this can go away without impacting on the citizenry of this country is farcical in the extreme.  We continue to hear from elements in the Opposition that bank bondholders — and I suppose by extension depositors — particularly senior bondholders can be told to take losses and that they will not be getting their money back while at the same time providing no explanation as to how they would fund our banks and economy in the future.On the Order of Business, I heard Deputy Burton talk about the renegotiation of senior bonds.  If we renegotiate with senior bondholders, we would need to do the same with depositors.  Is she seriously suggesting that it would be possible to renegotiate with bondholders and depositors and then somehow expect there would not be a flight of capital from the country or that the cost of borrowing for the State would not increase exponentially?  Although Deputy O'Donnell shakes his head, much of his party's NewERA document——

It is easy to criticise what is being done by the Government but it is another thing to propose an alternative policy with the capacity to work and be funded by the international markets.  Fine Gael has not done that and continues to undermine its own policy by the suggestions it makes.  Clearly, we need to have policies that will improve competitiveness.  We are making progress in that regard and are working on it.  However, it is not good enough for us to sit back and suggest that just because we have reduced the cost of doing business here, somehow the rest of the world has stood still because it has not.  Competitiveness is improving in other states and we need to continue our work in that regard.

That is unfortunate because Fine Gael had brought some credibility to the discussion.  People in the business community in my constituency and across the country tell me they want to see the Oireachtas trying to work together on dealing with the country's economic difficulties.  Thankfully, the Government has taken the decisions in the past three years that have put us in a position where the economy is returning to growth.  Deputy O'Donnell might laugh but his finance spokesperson would admit that he also pays no regard to the party's NewERA document, which he has thrown in the bin, in effect, and claims it was created by the party's press office.  The Government is about stabilising the public finances which we have done, stabilising unemployment and creating jobs.

Today has brought closure and finality to that because there is certainty as to how that is being dealt with.  Regarding the real economy, at every stage the parties opposite try to talk down the good work being done by our citizens.  Some 1.9 million people are working in the country.  In 2009, we brought in €19 billion in foreign direct investment, which equates to half of what the entire United Kingdom brought in.  It brought in just short of €40 billion and we brought in €19 billion.  Ireland is a good place to do business and unlike my colleagues on the other side of the House, I am very positive about the country's prospects for next year.  Projections from many sources have been positive about our economic outlook including a recent Morgan Stanley report, published on 13 September, Peter Sutherland and the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn.We had to be upfront in dealing with the banking crisis.  If we had taken Deputy O'Donnell and his colleagues' approach of allowing the banks themselves to write down their debt, we would be still here in ten years time trying to figure it out.

By the end of this year, however, the country will have returned to economic growth.  Next year, there will be net job increases.  It is important that all Members, regardless of party, do what they can to ensure jobs are created for the 460,000 people out of work.  The slight decline in yesterday's live register figures is also to be welcomed.The Government is there to make decisions, not just talk about what it would do.  We are already setting the country on a course to recovery.  With the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, the country has turned the corner and has credibility in the international markets.I wish the Labour Party, whose Members are absent from the Chamber now, was more cautious about some of its public comments.  It is simply lying to the public with the claim it has a silver bullet that can fix all of this through temporary nationalisation of the banks.  That is simply not possible.  If we followed such a course, all the moneys raised by Bank of Ireland in the private markets in recent months would have actually been taxpayers' money.  The Labour Party has zero credibility.  Unfortunately, because it is not telling the truth to the public, some people believe there is an easier option.  There is not.Thankfully, last night the Oireachtas decided to extend the bank guarantee scheme.  Through the fees it charges, it has brought €1 billion into the Exchequer.  The next scheme will be more costly for the banks.  I, like all Members, have no truck with the banks.  We all have had complaints about their practices.  I have received many complaints about how AIB treats small businesses.  The decision today to take a majority stake in AIB is important because it will ensure credit will flow to the SME sector.  The Government has identified through Bank of Ireland and AIB €6 billion in working capital for the SME sector for the next two years which will be monitored by the credit review group, headed by John Trethowan.  While the process may be a little slow, it is necessary.  The indigenous SME sector employs over 800,000 people and we must do everything we can to support it.  The Government has also brought in the employment subsidies scheme which protects more than 100,000 jobs and several other initiatives.The Opposition parties have put forward initiatives as well.  I hope during the framing of the next budget, they will put across their proposals and all parties can examine realistic policies that can be agreed by all.  While I would expect that of Fine Gael, I do not expect it of the Labour Party.Unemployment is the single largest issue.  I speak as someone who had the experience of being out of work in the 1990s.  We need to improve the market to enable growth.  Our costs have come down and we are becoming more competitive.  We will be able to attract necessary foreign direct investment.  The Government must also ensure the indigenous SME sector is supported.  Today's announcements on the banks have been welcomed by Europe and the bond markets.  The country has funding until the middle of next year.  This time next year, I believe we will be dealing with a much more positive situation in the economy.

#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I commend Deputy Bruton on tabling this Private Members' motion.The one issue causing much disillusionment among the public is unemployment and the haemorrhage of jobs.  Almost every family has seen some of their children either lose their job, be unable to get one, not even get an acknowledgement or interview or be forced to take the emigrant plane like the emigrant ship in the last century.The Government's policy until a week ago to get the economy right was first to recapitalise the banks and then the jobs would follow.  After the events of the past 24 hours, it will be some time before that happens.  The young educated, skilled people of this country cannot wait for five or ten years.  They need to be given some help immediately.I welcome this recent change of heart by the Government that job creation is critical.  I hope, however, this is not another optical illusion which ends like the funding for computers promised to schools by the beginning of 2010 which never materialised.  One critical area in the economy which has suffered more that any other sector is the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  At the height of what was almost full employment five years ago, 50% of it was provided by the SME sector.  Each of them was employing small numbers with a good spread across every city, town, village and crossroads.These are the very same businesses that have bled tens of thousands of jobs over the past three years.  These job losses have not got national headlines because they have been in fives and tens.  Nonetheless, they have been the largest contributors to the live register figures.These businesses cannot get any credit from the banks.  As a result of the finality brought to the bank bailout, we have been told credit will open up again.  How many times have we heard that same statement in the past two years?  These businesses are hit with the same, and in many cases additional, local authority levies that they had to pay at the height of the boom even though their incomes and footfall have been decimated.  These same businesses have to wade through sacks of red tape and regulation before they even open their doors.These businesses have the potential to provide thousands of jobs but they are not given any support.  Why can they not pay their local authority rates based on turnover or audited profits rather than valuations?  Why are there no other schemes like the PRSI subsidy scheme — for which only a few hundred offers were made when thousands applied — available to assist them?There is an urgent need to introduce personal examiner legislation for small businesses.  Provisions could contain safeguards preventing abuses by requiring detailed financial records to be put before the courts.  As a result, a small business which could otherwise go to the wall could be saved and jobs retained.  Thousands of jobs could be provided if the SME sector got proper support.  However, in the Government's economic strategy announced the other day, the sector was ignored.  In my contact with young people in my constituency clinics, I am aware of dozens forced to emigrate, not going abroad for a year or being head-hunted by a company abroad.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I compliment Deputy Bruton on putting down this important and timely motion, particularly when unemployment is savage.  The Government does not listen to the people.  Prior to the crash, people were predicting the property bubble would burst since one cannot give money away for free.  The Irish people predicted that young people would have millstones around their necks for the rest of their lives.  Obviously, commentators and experts will pat each other on the back — last night David McWilliams was being commended for predicting the crash.  He was not on his own, however.  Someone in every household predicted this crash, an argument the Government fails to hear.People never wanted to pump billions of euro in Anglo Irish Bank.  Today's announcement is more money going into a dark hole that will lead to dark times for many years to come.There are, however, solutions.  The Government will try to stretch its lifetime as far as possible but it has the opportunity to do something while it is still in place about red tape and bureaucracy.  Every person in business in this country is stifled with red tape.  The situation is so bad that it keeps prices up.  We cannot continue with these high costs.  The legacy of this Fianna Fáil Government is that it has the most sophisticated state-sponsored bureaucracy in the EU.  Everyone knows that; we go on holiday to Spain, France and Belgium and see how we have gone too far to implement directives while blaming Europe.Job creation, retraining and up-skilling were all mentioned.  There are perfectly well trained nurses heading to London and elsewhere because they cannot get work here.  There are teachers who are well qualified to educate the people of this country but they cannot get a teaching post.  I appreciate there is a moratorium in place in the public service but we must review its implementation.  People at the coalface, be they nurses or teachers, are well trained and want to work but cannot get a job.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I thank Deputy Bruton for tabling this motion.  Everything he predicted as Fine Gael finance spokesman has come true.  I remember several budget nights when we talked about the famous bubble, where an inordinate amount of funding was coming into the Exchequer from one source, the building sector.  Everyone knew it would not last.We must work our way out of this.  I lay the blame at the feet of the Government for the way it has handled everything, particularly Anglo Irish Bank.  It was an absolute disgrace because the Government did not even know until this morning how much it would cost.  We do not know if a further €5 billion must be invested to get out of this black hole.People glibly talk about unemployment figures going up or down by 5,000.  We should consider the impact on every area — unless we get a grip and help the SME sector, there will be problems.  Each business might employ an extra one, two or three other people.  It is the road to go for recovery but the Government has turned its back on it.Unemployment has hit homes in every parish in Ireland.  In County Galway in August 2008, there were 14,460 unemployed people.  In August 2010, the figure was 25,300.  In Ballinalsoe in August 2008, there were 1,449 unemployed people and that had increased to 2,759 in August 2010.  These are human beings who are stuck at home, drawing the dole they do not want.  No matter how the figures are massaged, these are the people we must worry about.The idea of a national recovery bank must be carefully considered.  If people have a good business proposition, they must get the necessary investment.  AIB was the bank that most people went to in this country and today we hear that it has almost been taken over the Government.  People in every house in Ireland are horrified.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  The volcanic ash cloud has cleared from over Iceland but this morning all of us in Ireland have discovered an even darker cloud over the Irish economy.  The people must face further pain as they are €16 billion worse off than they were yesterday.  There is huge discontent at the way the wrongdoers who caused this crisis have got off with this lightly while the ordinary people must bear the pain.The recession has left 455,000 people unemployed, 170,000 people in negative equity and 110,000 families facing winter with no light or heat.  Thousands of young people are leaving the country.  Unemployment among the under 25s in County Clare has reached 60.74% in the past two years.  According to CSO emigration figures, not since 1989 have we seen such levels of emigration.  The country faces a huge brain drain that must be addressed.The recent announcements of the Government, unveiling and repackaging old job strategies for PR purposes, have contained nothing new.  There is nothing smart in the new strategy Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.  It is overly ambitious and lacks credibility.How does the Government intend to deliver 15,000 extra jobs in the tourism sector and increase visitor numbers to 8 million while persisting with the €10 travel tax?  As an island nation, the best way to create jobs in the tourism industry is to abolish this tax.  We are dependent on air access into the country and all airlines are committed to increasing services into the country if the tax was axed.  We should call Michael O'Leary's bluff.  He has recently reduced services from Shannon, Kerry and Dublin.  According to recent figures, only €45 million was collected under this tax for the first six months of the year.  The revenue falls well short of the predicted amount of €125 million while some people say we are losing €450 million in revenue as a result of this tax.  The casualties of the tax are clear to see — visitor numbers are declining and airlines have cut services.  As a result, bed and breakfasts, hotels, restaurants and car hire companies are struggling.  Shannon Airport has been the biggest victim of the tax.  If the airport is to turn a corner and restore services, this tax has to be abolished.The game is up for this Government.  It is bereft of ideas and its strategies have failed the country and have brought it to the brink.  It is now time that the people were given a choice to elect a new Government.  I commend Deputy Bruton for tabling the motion.

My colleagues have touched on many of the areas but I want to zone in on one term, namely, "credibility".  We have Government spokespersons and Deputies coming out and continually saying that the Opposition is making soundings without any content.  I want to consider this in the cold light of day.  Why are we here at this particular point in time today?  It is because of the policies implemented by the Government, particularly in regard to the banks.  I read the announcement today from the Minister on the recapitalisation of the banks and could find little or nothing about credit to the real economy.  It is all about the banks and having to reprogramme the budget, thereby hitting taxpayers.When the guarantee was put in place, the Government had a two year window of opportunity to deal with the banks.  It procrastinated.  We put forward very straightforward policies which involved the banks dealing with their toxic loans and setting up good banks.  Furthermore, we spoke about a national recovery bank, which concerned the flow of credit to the SME sector which is currently dying on its feet.  It is the lifeblood of this economy.  Half of our general Government deficit is due to unemployment.  The Government did not factor in any sort of growth.Now we are in a situation whereby €90 billion is going into the banks, including NAMA.  It is the equivalent to virtually 100% of our annual wealth.  How did we get to this position?  How do we have a situation whereby the biggest bank in the country is being nationalised today?  How did that happen?  It is because the policy the Government went with put no onus on the banks to deal with their situations.  Effectively, they put their hands out and all the Government asked was, "How much more do you need?".The problem is getting the real economy going.  Furthermore, the old board of AIB needs to be told to step down by the Minister.  I heard him earlier saying it was not his role to interfere with boards of banks.  We now effectively own AIB.  That is taxpayers' money and he who pays the piper calls the tune.  We need to send out a marker to the international markets that change and credibility are going to happen.  Furthermore, our bond yields went down earlier by a minuscule amount.  We are paying 6.57% in international markets today.  The Government has put us in a position where the NTMA is reluctant to go out next month to borrow money on the international markets.The Minister said earlier that it is not going out because of the rates.  That sends out a message that there is a further degree of uncertainty.  It is about credibility and belief.  If I go into my local bank manager and I am doing well, he or she will more than likely give me the funding.  If I have made mistake after mistake and I go back to him or her, he or she will query my figures in minute detail.  The Government knew there were problems with Anglo Irish Bank.  It went to Bank of Ireland and said it wanted it to take it over because it was insolvent.Furthermore, Mr. Michael Somers, the former CEO of the NTMA, stated he was reluctant to give deposits to Anglo Irish Bank for a long period before that.  Now we have a situation where Irish taxpayers will have a millstone around their necks for the next ten years and beyond to repay €90 billion in debt, €52 billion of which is to recapitalise the banks and €40 billion of which is for NAMA.  NAMA was supposed to stabilise the market but it has had the opposite effect.  The haircuts are so severe that they have undermined the quality of the loan books in the banks while the international markets are looking on.The Government's banking and budgetary policies have failed because it did not factor in that the economy must grow and we must have jobs.  It is a four letter word — jobs.  The Government is very slow to cop on to it.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I commend Fine Gael and Deputy Bruton for tabling this motion.  To the minds of everyone looking at this House recently, and particularly yesterday and today, the biggest issue is jobs.  Some 100,000 people have left this country, which is shameful, and 450,000 people are on the live register.  There is nothing the vast majority of the people concerned crave more than a job.  The one fear in every household in Ireland is the lack of a job for a family member.  The fact that 100,000 young people have left our shores to go to Australia, America, Canada, mainland Europe or elsewhere in search of a job is a shame on this Government.To give any reason for it happening is simply inexcusable.  In the time I have been in this House, in every budget debate Deputy Richard Bruton has stood up and pointed out to the then Minister, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the current Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that there was a major bubble and problem in the country.  The Government benches laughed at every proposal.  They did not agree with Deputy Bruton.  They condemned what he said as talking our economy down.  The truth of the matter is that he was right and ultimately the 100,000 people who have left our shores and the 450,000 people who are signing on are the people paying the price for the fact that the Government did not listen to Deputy Bruton.We can talk about every television programme or radio station, but the buck stops in Leinster House.  We were warned by Deputy Bruton about what should not happen.  The fact is that this Government is not serious about job creation.  A significant number of small businesses are ready and willing to take a chance at expansion but the reason they cannot do so is because they are hampered by Government charges and credit facilities from our banks.  While we recapitalise and fund the banks, the reality is that we are not forcing the financial institutions to allow credit to flow to small businesses.  We can talk about creating 300,000 jobs in press releases, but the fact is that unless the banks free up capital to those people, no jobs will be created.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I want to touch on the issue of the banks.  I have the business review from the NTMA from 1 July 2010.  The national debt at that stage was €84 billion for the first half of this year, with a deficit of €20 billion.  At the end of this year it will be €94 billion.  On top of that there is €81 billion, which the NTMA states NAMA will cost, plus the costs of €45 billion we found out about today.  The sum total is approximately €230 billion.I want to be fair.  Over a period of ten years, NAMA will generate some funds.  The news is not all negative but it will be mostly negative.  The State will owe €240 billion at the end of this year in comparison to where it was three years ago.  At the time of the last general election, the national debt was approximately €35 billion.  The Government has increased it almost ninefold.  That is astonishing and is the dilemma we now face.Another difficulty we face is what Mr. Michael Somers said when he spoke to the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party in Waterford.  This country has an obsession with process.  We cannot get things done because of the stream of red tape, criteria, rules and directives that exists.  We employ an army of people to implement rules that are hindering our progress.  We are told we cannot do certain things because of the rules.  I will give the House a good example of what I am talking about.  The Leas Cheann-Comhairle will be familiar with the Arklow Banks wind farm from his journeys up and down to Dublin.  Six offshore wind turbines have been constructed, but it is planned to construct almost 200 further turbines.  This €1 billion project is supposed to be financed with equity from the private equity markets, but it is not happening because someone somewhere is stopping it.  Airtricity, which is promoting the project, started a similar project off the east coast of Britain at the same time, and it is now under construction.  The two projects are in different jurisdictions, but they are subject to the same EU directives.  It is madness that we are stopping the development of the Arklow Banks project, which would involve a number of full-time maintenance jobs.I will conclude by speaking about small business.  As a commercial dairy farmer with two employees, I am strangled by the processes involved.  I encounter red tape all the way.  Some 4,500 people in my district are unemployed.  In County Wexford as a whole, the relevant number is 20,000.  They have not chosen to be unemployed — they want to be in gainful employment so they can contribute to this country's tax take.  The only way we can develop as a nation is by increasing our tax take and our GDP so that people can contribute instead of taking.  Although our proposals are sound, the Government is continuing to snipe at them for the sake of it.  The Government will not accept any of our ideas.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	235	In its recent publication, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy: A Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, the Government identified the role of tourism in employment creation as a key element of its strategy.  I would like to use the few minutes available to me to make a few recommendations to the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  I will speak about what he and his Government colleagues should do to fulfil the commitment they made in that document.Deputy Breen mentioned the issue of the departure tax.  I remind the Minister of State that most EU member states no longer impose such a tax.  Holland abolished its departure tax in 2009 on the basis that while it raised €312 million, it cost the Dutch economy €1 billion.  Economists and people like Michael O'Leary — regardless of what people say about him — have recognised that the departure tax acts as an impediment to bringing people into this country.  We welcome people to Ireland by imposing this charge on them.  It does not act as an incentive for them to come to Ireland.  It does not help us to sell Ireland.  Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Sweden and Malta have all abolished their departure taxes.  The Government has an opportunity to change its strategy in this regard in the forthcoming budget.  I suggest that the departure tax should be scrapped.Access to credit is a major issue.  We have all encountered it in our personal capacities and when dealing with community enterprises, etc.  The Government needs to intervene following the withdrawal of Bank of Scotland from the Irish market.  Irish hoteliers had approximately €2 billion in loans with that bank.  They also relied on the bank for overdrafts, etc.  There will be widespread casualties if the Government does not step in.  The creation of a national recovery bank, which was proposed by Fine Gael through Deputy Bruton, should be the subject of serious consideration.  The establishment of a new national credit corporation, as favoured by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and other tourism bodies, should be seriously considered at this stage.Fine Gael's very good policy document, NewERA, was ridiculed by the Government but recognised by people like David McWilliams.  It should have been considered by the Government.  It was a well thought through policy.  One aspect of it was the roll-out of the broadband network.  During the summer months, I met a number of business people in County Kerry who would like to be able to do their business from Kerry or elsewhere in the west of Ireland for a month each year.  They cannot do so at present because our broadband services are not adequate.  That is a key issue.  I will conclude by saying the Government should scrap the departure tax, increase access to credit and facilitate the roll-out of broadband to this country's tourist areas, most of which are in the west.

While I will not congratulate him just yet, I would like to thank him for giving us an opportunity to highlight what the Government is trying to do to address the severe economic challenges that exist.As I have just five minutes in which to speak, I do not propose to engage extensively in political rhetoric.  However, it should be noted that an attempt has been made to rewrite history in the Chamber this morning.  Some people have claimed to have forecast the difficulties that now face the Irish economy.  I distinctly remember that during the building and construction boom, Deputies on all sides of the House castigated the Government for its failure to extend capital allowances for urban renewal, the development of hotels and the Shannon region.  It is a little disingenuous for people to claim they forecast with clarity and certainty that the property bubble would collapse in the manner it did.  As I have said, Deputies from every party continually supported the extension of schemes for which my political party are now being vilified, having supported them in the first place.The biggest fall-out from the downturn, in terms of collateral damage, has been the loss of jobs.  This has had a particular effect on young people, many of whom now feel that few opportunities are available to them.  As a Parliament, a Government and a people, we have two options.  I suggest that we should face our serious difficulties, accept the realities of where we are and deal with these matters from there.  We have an impaired banking system and an economy that contracted by 10% last year, but it is probable that we will experience positive growth this year.  That is critically important.  We have to point out that this country is now on the verge of turning a very difficult corner.  We will encounter more collateral damage if we do not speak in positive terms and try to introduce policies that address serious issues, such as the lack of credit.People continually talk about the bailout of the banks.  It is often said that no Government would stand idly by and allow the entire banking system to collapse.  That is what would have happened on 29 September 2008 if most of the political parties in this Chamber had not supported the bank guarantee.  One party, which stood out and opposed the blanket guarantee in its entirety, is now claiming it was opposing elements of the guarantee rather than the guarantee itself.  If one examines the record, one will find that it opposed the guarantee in its entirety.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The banking situation is of critical importance.  This is not about bailing out banks.  We are trying to address the impaired balance sheets of the banks so they can access credit and capital, lend it to small and medium-sized businesses and ensure it flows into the broader economy.  That is a critical part of the Government's job creation strategies.  We need to have a functioning banking system that supports small and medium-sized businesses, lends to individuals, supports the purchase of homes and cars.  Confidence is needed if such an increase in consumer spending is to happen.As someone who has travelled the world to try to promote this country in as positive a manner as possible, I emphasise that some of the negative commentary from people in this Chamber — it is incessant from some quarters — is undermining this country's hope of turning a difficult corner.  I can genuinely say that I have more at stake as a father of young children than I ever will as a Minister of State.  This is dragging the country down.  It is not a question of shooting the messenger.  People should report in an honest and fair manner.  They can be critical when criticism is necessary.  At the same time, they should try to be supportive during this difficult time for the Government, the Parliament and the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs.  If we consistently undermine this country, and almost hope it will fail, we will do a disservice to those who are trying to run a small business and create employment and the hundreds of thousands of people who are trying to look for work at present.On a political note, as a member of Fianna Fáil I will accept any blame that is apportioned to me for what was not done in the context of oversight of the banks and perhaps putting the brakes on earlier through budgetary policy.  However, equally every political party in the Dáil put inflationary policies before the people in the 2007 general election.  Not one political party stated we should increase stamp duty and slow the property market.  To be honest and fair about the criticism I will accept, people must be honest with themselves.  However, the negative sentiment that sometimes comes from this Chamber, but more importantly from outside the Chamber by some of our broadcasters, is damaging opportunities and the hope that we can turn this corner using the only resource that we have, which is the people themselves.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.

If the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher looks back on the record of the Dáil he will see time and again that following the budget announcements made by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance, this side of the House consistently pointed out that the over-dependence on income from property tax was unsustainable and would lead to a bust.  This was pointed out time and again in this House and outside it.  The Government chose to ignore those warnings.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, spoke about the messenger; broadcast and print media are at the messengers and they report matters as they see them.  The Minister of State should look to his own.I accept what the Minister of State stated, that he will take whatever blame is coming.  We have had many reports that point to the fact that we would not be in this situation today if different decisions had been taken.  Nevertheless, that is an issue which will be decided by the people when we have a general election.  They will be the final arbitrator on where they see things having gone wrong.In the few moments available to me, I want to focus on a couple of points.  This is about job creation and pointing out to the Government where it can provide the type of environment where jobs and enterprise can flourish.  We have an enormous problem in banking.  However, at the same time, stimulus must be provided and we need to create the type of environment in which enterprise can develop and existing enterprises can stabilise.The Forfás report produced last week outlined various areas in which enterprise can be encouraged and developed.  In his opening statement, Mr. Martin Shanahan stated now is the time for action.  We have had all the reports.  We know what has to be done.  The National Competitiveness Council produced a report outlining the costs of doing business in this country and what needs to be done to ensure we become more competitive.  This report recommends various initiatives that can and should be taken across a range of areas, including education and skills development.  I will focus on entrepreneurship and regulation in that area, which will be very important.  It will not be the solution to everything but we have to continue to ensure that we have an environment in which entrepreneurs can dip their toes in the water, start up businesses and employ people.  The indigenous sector is the lifeblood of this economy and small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country will be the key to success.Bankruptcy law should distinguish between those who are reckless and fraudulent.  The bankruptcy laws in this country are Draconian and need to be updated.  We have had one nod in this direction from the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, which would reduce the application period to the court for discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to six years.  This is not enough.  As it stands, the law on bankruptcy for individuals and companies is putting people off establishing businesses and does not contribute to an environment in which we can encourage entrepreneurs.  Will the Minister of State ask the Government to examine this area?  It is something that can be done, it is probably cost neutral, and would contribute to creating an environment in which people can start their own businesses.  It would encourage small and medium-sized enterprises and the creation of jobs throughout the country.

He wanted to do the wrap-up but could not do so because of urgent public business.  I apologise for not having stated this sooner.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I support the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton.  It is very timely because I believe jobs are at the centre of our difficulties.  In recent years, the number of those on social welfare has doubled, which has major implications for the country.  I welcome the recent announcements made in my constituency, particularly in my home county of Monaghan, of 150 jobs in Monaghan Mushrooms and 35 jobs in Shabra Plastics, a company I was deeply involved in founding.  However, the reality is that those 150 new jobs in Monaghan were transferred from existing companies in Mayo.  Nationally, there was no improvement whatsoever.Small and medium-sized enterprises, together with the retail trade, are under severe pressure from banks.  Today, we will commit further hundreds of millions of euro to various banks.  However, the Government is failing to get those banks to release funds to allow businesses to employ more people and get on with their jobs.  Only 3% of those targeted for Government PRSI incentive schemes have been reached and there are only three months to go.There is another issue about which I am extremely angry.  The Government's business regulation forum states a saving of €500 million per year can be made by cutting back on regulation.  However, only 4% of this has been reached.  We have to get real about this issue.  I live in a Border area and recently two business people presented information to a forum.  One of them was from Northern Ireland and the other was from southern Ireland but doing 80% of his business north of the Border.  He explained that he sought information from a Department here and was told the only way to get it was from the website.  However, on the website he would have had to go through 2,300 pages to get what he wanted.  He rang the office in Northern Ireland because he needed the same information for there.  The person to whom he spoke told him he would get back to him in five minutes, and did so with a single page document.  If that is the type of thing we have to deal with, we are not serious about creating jobs.  I know there are websites and great technology.  However, busy business people need the co-operation of the public service to ensure that business can flow.We do not have as many people on social welfare as we might because 100,000 of our best young people have emigrated.  I was extremely sad when speaking to a middle-aged couple about their family of two, one in Canada and the other in Australia.  The only contact they have with them is through the computer; they sit down on a Sunday and use a mechanism to talk to them.  We did not educate those young people for that.  The State paid a great deal of money to educate them.  They want to work here; they want to be part of our society.  However, the Government is doing nothing.  Look at what has been proposed; it simply has not worked.  For God's sake, get out there and introduce innovations that will work or get out and allow in somebody else who will do it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21018	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I thank all of those who participated in this debate, both on my own benches and on the Labour Party benches, and, indeed, on the Fianna Fáil benches — the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, adopted a particularly constructive approach.I do not doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher's sincerity in addressing the issue of employment because we are facing a horrendous crisis.  However, I would say to him and to the Government that if they keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome, they are simply fooling themselves.  That is the problem with this Government.  It keeps doing the same thing in the case of banks and the public finances and ignoring the wider competitiveness agenda.I was alarmed at the smugness of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, when he spoke last night.  He suggested that the Government had everything under control.  It was bizarre.  I do not know whether he read the National Competitive Council report, which is hot off the press.  It listed 36 areas in the red zone where Ireland was seriously uncompetitive and damaging job prospects.  Twenty of those were directly within the responsibility of Ministers and we had the Minister trotting in here like a two year old pretending that all of these matters were under control.The public, not to mention the markets, was stunned at the naivety of the Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy document.  I do not envy the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, the task of chairing a group that will look at the implementation of this because I have never seen such a vacuous set of proposals emerge from any Department.  It contained measures such as monitoring international media reports of Ireland.  It raised the issue of air access to the country but never mentioned the travel tax.  It is a bizarre document.This was supposed to be a jobs document and it was glossed up with 300,000 jobs.  There is not a single commitment to cut the cost of any area of Government.  There is not a single initiative on credit.  There is not a single initiative on the €500 million in compliance costs that are unnecessarily paid by business, according to the Government itself.  There is not a single new initiative on the roll-out of broadband — it simply rabbits what the Minister has already stated.There is no initiative to tackle the chaos that reigns in both waste and water policy, which has been highlighted time and again to the Government by the National Competitiveness Council and by Forfás.  They highlighted the approach that the Minister is taking to waste management, the total lack of regulatory fairness in the way waste management is handled in this country and the chaos in the case of water.  There is not a single initiative in those areas.There is no commitment to link research and development to employment, which is a core recommendation to try to upgrade the skill base and product development.  There is no mention of the need to address that aspect.There is no initiative on specific bottlenecks which, as Deputy Clune correctly stated, were highlighted in the interesting report, Making it Happen.  These are bottlenecks that are holding back specific sectors, such as the medical devices sector, and include the difficulty of getting regulatory approvals from ethics committees that are chaotic and difficult to get through.  There were many specific initiatives where the Government could have pledged, "We will remove that bottleneck.  That is one thing we will remove and we will have it done in six months."There was no commitment to enforce competition law.  There have been umpteen reports about the need to reduce our costs in sheltered sectors where there are barriers to competition, but there is not a mention of it in the Government's great document that is supposed to create 300,000.  This was simply an exercise in putting a bulldog clip around a whole lot of stuff that is there already and coming up with a big number to try to manage the media, not the economy.I must say this to the Minister of State and it is a pity the Minister is not here — the stakes are too high to go on with that sort of political claptrap.  These are commitments where a Government must say it will implement these changes.  It will set out a roadmap, milestones and the date on which it expects these to be done.  It will pin responsibility on someone and expect that to happen.We cannot continue to preside over a situation where 80% of the job losses are affecting people under the age of 30.  These people are vanishing.  According to the figures this week, 30,000 Irish people emigrated last year.  We are heading for 50,000, which would mean the entire cohort leaving our schools and colleges would be emigrating every year.  If that happens, we will see our economy sacrifice and lose the core skills that we need to rebuild this country.The employment crisis is the main crisis.  Banking and fiscal policy are constraints on what we might do, but we are certainly not powerless and there are umpteen recommendations available to the Government on which it need only commit and state it will do whatever it takes to get this done within a fixed timescale.  That would be a jobs strategy.  Then we would see Ministers putting their own reputations on the line and stating they will ensure that it happens.However, that is not what any of these documents offer.  That is not what the Minister offered when he came in here last night.  That is why people are frustrated and upset.  The real crisis for most families around the country — the loss of their young talented people — is simply not being taken seriously by the Government.

I made the point this morning that the subject of the statements is part of the national crisis in which we are now caught, and that it is important that Members of every party and none will have the opportunity to have their say during the contribution period.  That may well mean the debate may have to drift on until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.Deputy English made a point on the Order of Business that is relevant and which the Minister understands.  The Minister answered many questions or tried to do so as best he could at the press conference this morning in Government Buildings.  Before the weekend, it is important that the Minister for Finance be able to answer questions Deputies have on today's events to this point.  The tradition in the House has always been to wait until the conclusion of a debate and that the Minister responsible would then answers questions.  That is what is envisaged in the announcement of the Whip.  That could be Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.Would it be possible for the Ceann Comhairle, during the taking of ordinary questions by the Minister today, to allow Members some flexibility to drift into the events of today rather than waiting until the conclusion of the debate next Tuesday or Wednesday?  If the Ceann Comhairle could allow this, with the consent of the Minister — he appears to be willing — Deputies who may have questions to ask today will be able to ask them, thus allowing us to surmount this little problem.

Since the Government's announcement of the banking guarantee two years ago, the State has been required to stand behind the domestic banks and building societies to safeguard the financial system and the economy.  In my statement to the House last night on the motion approving the ELG scheme, I recalled that the Irish banking system was teetering on the brink on the 29 of September 2008.  In an unprecedented development, international credit markets had ceased functioning.  In stark terms, the liquidity that our banking system needed to lubricate normal day-to-day financial operations was running out.  In the absence of radical action, the banking system was facing closure within days.As I reminded the House yesterday, the report by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, confirms this scenario in all its objectively frightening detail.  The Governor clearly endorsed in the report, and has recently confirmed his endorsement, of the need for an extensive guarantee for the banks, which guarantee was provided by the Government on 29 September 2008 on a blanket basisin order to send a clear and unambiguous message to what the Governor characterised as hysterical global financial markets that the Irish State would take whatever steps were necessary to ensure the sustainability of our banking system.My statement earlier today represents the final staging post in the journey initiated by the provision of the bank guarantee by bringing certainty and clarity to the proposed costs for the State for the resolution of our most distressed institutions.  It is a key milestone in ensuring that broader-scale restructuring of the banking sector overall is successfully achieved in order that we have for the future a banking system that is firmly focused on meeting the needs of the real economy, sustainable employment creation and the savings, investment and credit needs of ordinary individuals, households and businesses.The overriding theme of my banking statement and the shared objectives of all the authorities, including the Central Bank and the NTMA, which played such a pivotal role in the process underpinning it, is the urgent need to reinforce international market confidence in the restoration of our banking system to health, and our capacity to take the steps essential to achieving the enduring sustainability of our budgetary position.International financial markets have been clamouring for some time for greater certainty on the final costs of repairing the very substantial damage wrought by irresponsible and reckless lending practices and systemic failures in corporate governance and risk management.  With my announcement this morning and the publication by the Central Bank of the assumptions and methodology underlying the capital figures, this clarity has now been achieved.The public is understandably and rightly angry about what has happened in our banking system in recent years.  I share that anger but anger is not a policy on its own and we must now turn to the resolution of our problems.  The information I have provided to the markets demonstrates that the Government's strategy for ensuring that, and although we are recognising these huge banking sector costs in our deficit this year, which is projected to spike at 32%, we have a mechanism to spread these costs over an extended period in excess of ten years.  This will ensure that these costs will be manageable in terms of our current requirement to finance very significant levels of public expenditure through borrowing by the NTMA in international markets.  The assessment that these costs are manageable within an appropriately revised framework for fiscal consolidation in Ireland is one that has been expressed by the Governor of the Central Bank on several occasions and is stated clearly in his statement also issued earlier today.I said in my statement that it is imperative that we remain focused on our major challenge, which is to ensure that our public finances are returned to a stable and sustainable path.  This objective is not, of course, an end in itself; rather, it is the main prerequisite to returning the economy to a path of stable and balanced growth to ensure the future economic well-being of our society.  The fiscal challenges that face us in restoring the sustainability of our public finances are substantial but I am convinced that they are surmountable.The projected Government deficit of 32% of GDP includes once-off capital support, as detailed in my statement, of almost 20% of GDP.  It is crucial to recognise that were it not for this once-off spike, we would broadly meet our budget targets for this year.I have set out in my statement the steps the Government will take in the coming weeks to demonstrate a credible pathway over a four-year period to achieve our budgetary goals.  A high level of certainty regarding the final NAMA discounts for each of the participating institutions has provided us with the detailed basis for concluding our assessment of the capital needs of the banking sector.  An assessment by NAMA of the loan-by-loan valuations carried out in respect of the transfer of approximately €27 billion of land and development and related loans into NAMA together with the comprehensive and detailed information now available to it on the remaining loan books has allowed the agency to refine its estimates of the discounts on the remaining loans to be transferred to a high level of accuracy.  These final estimates have in turn allowed the Central Bank to update its assessments of the capital position of all of the institutions participating in NAMA following the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, earlier in the year and the EU-wide CEBS stress testing exercise carried out in July.As I announced, the Government has agreed a number of steps to provide certainty about the impact of NAMA transfers including that all remaining NAMA transfers should be completed in one single tranche for each of the participating institutions and the accelerated transfer of NAMA-eligible loans to complete the process by mid-October in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  In addition, the Government has decided that where the total exposure of a debtor is below a €20 million threshold in Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, that debtor's loans will not now be transferred to NAMA.  The previous threshold had been set at €5 million.  This will ensure NAMA can operate to the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in the management of its loan portfolio.All of these actions will be undertaken in accordance with the NAMA legislation and the European Commission state aid approval for the NAMA scheme, in particular the principle of a loan-by-loan valuation of all NAMA transfers.  I very much welcome the statement by the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Almunia, this morning in regard to the Irish banks.  He welcomed the comprehensive assessment contained in my statement this morning on banking, indicating that it brings clarity with regard to the remaining transfer of assets to NAMA and the capital needs of some banks and building societies.  The Commissioner indicated that the announced changes to the way NAMA manages loans are in line with the Commission's approval of the NAMA scheme.Concerning Anglo Irish Bank, from a competition point of view, the Commissioner said it is clear that the foreseen restructuring and resolution of the bank addresses competition distortion created by the large amounts of aid at stake.  Once the Commission receives details of the plan, it will proceed rapidly toward a final decision.  Mr. Almunia also welcomes the announcement that subordinated debt holders will make a significant contribution toward meeting the costs of Anglo Irish Bank.  This is line with the Commission's principles on burden-sharing since it both addresses moral hazard and limits the amount of aid, to the benefit to the taxpayer.The Commissioner noted that Allied Irish Bank will require further capital in the form of state aid which will have to be notified to the Commission for approval.  He indicated that he will follow this process very closely and he has no doubt that as in all previous cases, the collaboration between the Irish authorities and the European Commission will be satisfactory.  He also notes positively that Bank of Ireland will be able to continue its restructuring process without further recourse to State resources and noted the earlier approval of the bank's plan in terms of aid and restructuring.With regard to the building societies, the Commission remains in close contact with the Irish authorities.  In the case of the Irish Nationwide Building Society, the Commission will await the notification of the additional capital as well as details on the institution's future and will assess them thoroughly and swiftly.  In regard to the EBS, the Commission is in the process of analysing its initial assessment of the restructuring plan submitted in May.It is clear from the Commissioner's statement that the relationship between the Commission and the Government in regard to these matters has advanced to a very close level of collaboration.  I am confident the various measures we have announced today will secure the necessary approvals in due course.In regard to Anglo Irish Bank, the Central Bank has carried out a detailed analysis of potential losses in the bank in the coming years.  The examination has drawn on comprehensive information and analysis of Anglo's non-NAMA loan book carried out both by the bank and its advisers and independent consultants in preparing the bank's restructuring plan for the European Commission.  Information has also been made available by NAMA from a review of assets securing the loans in Anglo's remaining NAMA tranches.  This review has enabled NAMA to determine and advise the Central Bank of the expected discount of 67% on the remaining €19 billion of the bank's loans that are due to be transferred.The Central Bank has therefore established as definitively as possible the level of capital required by the new structure, that is, an additional €6.4 billion in total capital will be needed.  This additional capital requirement brings the projected total gross cost of the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank to €29.3 billion.  This additional capital will be provided by increasing the promissory note issued by the State and by appropriate burden-sharing exclusively by holders of Anglo Irish Bank subordinated debt instruments, as I outlined in my statement.The severe stress-testing carried out by the Central Bank as detailed in its statement, including a 70% discount on the remainder of Anglo's NAMA loans, has concluded that the stress case level of losses in Anglo Irish Bank could potentially be €5 billion higher than in the expected case of €29.3 billion.  As made clear in my statement, the stress case indicates the upper boundary of the level of losses; it does not represent the Central Bank's expectation of the likely outcome and is not the basis for the final capitalisation of the bank.  The Government will capitalise the new structure to the expected requirement of €29.3 billion through the promissory note structure which extends the cost and the funding burden over a period in excess of a decade.  The authorities will also press ahead with the restructuring of the bank with a view to achieving the split of the bank early in 2011.As I had previously indicated, my statement also clarified the position regarding the Government's policy for achieving burden-sharing by holders of subordinated debt in Anglo Irish Bank and the situation of senior debt obligations.  The position is that under Irish law senior debt obligations rank equally with deposits and other creditors.  I have no plans to change this position.  There is, therefore, no question of seeking to impose losses on holders of such senior debt in Anglo Irish Bank or indeed in any credit institution in the State through any legislative measures.Indeed the legal competence of this House to effect such changes is very much in doubt having regard to the provisions of the relevant EU directives which prohibit differentiation between creditors and the provisions of our own Constitution which protect vested rights.  I am not saying on the record of this House that it is not legislatively competent to impose haircuts on creditors, but were we to impose haircuts on senior bondholders, equivalent haircuts would require to be imposed on depositors.  It is important that this is understood in this House.  Quite apart from the commercial and economic arguments involved in the location of Ireland as a major centre of multinational investment, the dependence of the NTMA on external funding and the dependence of our banks on external funding are major factors which should be weighed very carefully by Members of this House and by commentators in assessing the desirability of those policies that have been advocated from time to time and which point unequivocally in the direction of default in regard to these bondholders.As I indicated in my statement this morning, the question of subordinated bondholders is entirely separate and can be addressed through appropriate legislation, which the Taoiseach indicated this morning is listed for publication this year.  In any event, all the subordinated instruments in both the Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank do not mature for payment of their principal sums for a considerable period of time.  In regard to appropriate burden-sharing by holders of subordinated debt, that is a principle with which I agree and to which the Commission subscribes.  As can be seen from the figures I have outlined, the losses in the bank are substantial and it is right and proper that subordinated bondholders should share the costs that have arisen.  It is my view that a very steep discount must apply to these bondholders.  The NTMA will advise me on how to maximise the saving to the taxpayer in this regard.  If the issue were not addressed, the principal sums would fall due for payment eventually with substantial hazard to the taxpayer.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	268	It is not a matter of bluff when the solvency of the country has to be protected.  In keeping with this approach, my Department, in conjunction with the Attorney General, is working on resolution and reorganisation legislation which will enable the implementation of reorganisation measures specific to Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society which will address the issue of burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders.  The legislation will be consistent with the requirements for the measures to be recognised as a reorganisation under the relevant EU directive in other EU member states.To date €2.7 billion in capital has been provided to cover the losses on lending by the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The NTMA has recommended that I provide a further and final €2.7 billion, representing a prudential estimate of the capital required to cover expected losses on the residual loan book and bringing the total capital support to €5.4 billionI have accepted the NTMA's recommendation in order to establish a ceiling on the level of support provided to the society consistent with the objective of providing final clarity on the public support required by the Irish banking system.  I have asked the NTMA and my other advisers to explore options for the society and to bring finality to the position.  Management in INBS was replaced in 2009.  This further capital investment by the State will reassure depositors in the institution that all deposits remain secure.  Bank of Ireland has already met the Financial Regulator's 2010 capital requirement and the estimated NAMA transfers now announced do not mean it will not need any further capital.The Financial Regulator determined last March that to meet its capital requirements AIB must raise €7.4 billion by the end of 2010.  AIB has already announced the sale of its Polish subsidiary, BZWBK, which is expected to generate capital of €2.5 billion.  In view of the increased NAMA discount for AIB the Central Bank has concluded that an additional amount of €3 billion will be required.  This brings the new total capital requirement for AIB, after deducting the capital generated on the sale of its Polish subsidiary, to €7.9 billion.  In the current stressed market conditions, the bank is unlikely to be able to conduct a traditional privately underwritten transaction on a substantial scale.  To afford every opportunity to AIB to raise as much as possible of the required capital from the markets and, to minimise further Government support, it has been decided that this capital requirement will be met through placing an open offer to shareholders of AIB shares to the value of €5.4 billion.  This transaction will be fully underwritten by the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission, NPRFC, and is expected to be completed in 2010.  If necessary, the NPRFC's underwriting commitment will be satisfied by the conversion of up to €1.7 billion of its existing preference shares in the bank into ordinary shares, along with a new cash investment for the balance of €3.7 billion in ordinary shares.  This transaction structure assumes the sale of AIB's stake in M&T Bank and disposal of other assets in due course.  In the event that the bank's residual capital requirement is not met through asset sales by 31 March 2011, any shortfall will be met by the conversion of a proportion of the remaining €1.8 billion of preference shares.  As a consequence of these actions, it is likely that the State will hold a majority shareholding in AIB.The high level of State support being provided to AIB is absolutely essential given the central role AIB plays in the Irish economy and the Irish financial system.  In the coming weeks, I will be working closely with the board of the bank on behalf of the Government to ensure that AIB successfully overcomes its current challenges and develops a renewed strategic focus on the Irish market following the sale of its overseas operations.  In conjunction with the recapitalisation, there will be management and board changes in AIB.  The bank's board has agreed with Mr. Dan O'Connor that he will step down as executive chairman within the coming weeks.  The bank's board has also agreed with the group managing director, Mr. Colm Doherty, the termination of his contract on existing terms.  Mr. Doherty will depart AIB before the end of 2010.  I appreciate the efforts of Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Doherty in successfully selling the Polish subsidiary and in helping to manage the bank in the transitional period.The projected final NAMA discount for EBS is in the region of 60%.  The Central Bank has advised that this final discount will have no material implications for the overall capital requirements of the banking system.  The society is in discussion with a number of parties about its future and any adjustment in its capital need that arises will be accommodated in the outcome of those discussions in due course.The Government is committed to restoring sustainability to our public finances.  The inclusion in this year's deficit of the banking support measures does not alter this commitment in any way.  This target can be achieved in a manner which is consistent with maintaining a sustainable trajectory for Ireland's general government debt and the capacity of the National Treasury Management Agency to fund the Exchequer's borrowing requirement.  Today's announcement brings full clarity to the costs and methods of recapitalising the banks.What is now most important is that we have a credible path to show how we propose to meet our budgetary commitments.  Accordingly, a four year budgetary plan will be published in early November, which will incorporate the annual measures.

This is an appalling disaster.  The Government's strategy on banking has collapsed around it and the credibility of the Minister for Finance is in tatters this morning.Following all the spin and propaganda, the country is left in the situation of having to cancel next month's bond auction.  Why?  Because the country does not have credit worthiness any more and could not sell the bonds at an affordable price.  That is the bottom line on the banking strategy which the Government has pursued for two years.  We can no longer trade in the bond market because our sovereign credit worthiness is gone.It is not difficult to trace the Government's progress to date.  Two years ago yesterday, the Government introduced a blanket guarantee for the banks.  Not alone was the scope of the guarantee too wide, as indicated by the Governor of the Central Bank in his recent report, but the Government made the calamitous error of guaranteeing all of Anglo Irish Bank's liabilities.  It did so without knowing the full extent of those liabilities.  Months later, following introduction of the guarantee and the nationalisation at the beginning of 2009 of Anglo Irish Bank, the Minister assured this House that the potential liability of Anglo Irish Bank would not exceed €4.5 billion.  I accept the Minister was misled and misinformed and so on but there is a huge gap between €4.5 billion and the €34 billion referred to by the Minister in his statement this morning.The scope of the guarantee was a major policy error.  The more fundamental error made is what has now put the country in such a precarious position.  The error was one that no Government should make.  The Government put the credit worthiness of the sovereign State at risk to rescue a failed bank.  It should never have gotten into that situation.  The national interest always requires that one protects the credit worthiness of the sovereign.  When faced with the choice of the sovereign and a financial institution, one opts for the sovereign.  The Government should not have gotten itself into the situation it did.  I accept the Minister was badly served by the then Central Bank, the Financial Regulator's office and some of the advisers brought in at high rates of pay.  However, at the end of the day Deputy Brian Lenihan is the Minister.  He is the person who holds constitutional obligation for the finances of the State.  The role of only two Cabinet members is enshrined in the Constitution.  This happened on the Minister's watch and he is responsible for the disaster.

The answer to that is, I regret, yes it can if the Government collaborates with the bank.  We have almost reached the point of the rescue of Anglo Irish Bank bringing down this country with the Minister being forced this morning to announce the closure of the bond markets.  The closure of the bond market means the sovereign State is in deep trouble because it cannot borrow money.Anglo Irish Bank was supposed to be too big to fail.  On reflection, it was too big to save; that is the real position.  Because it was too big to save we should not have gone there.  In going there, we should not have covered all the debt.  Fine Gael has for two years proposed that bond holders should share the pain of the Anglo Irish Bank rescue and that the taxpayer should not stand alone as the only agent of rescue.  The Government has continually argued it cannot do that as to do so would send bad signals to the market and result in a loss of confidence in Ireland.  We have followed the Government strategy.  Month after month the Minister has given assurances that senior and subordinated debt will be covered in full.  Where has this got him?  It has got us to the point of not being able to have a bond auction next month.  This proves that the Government's guarantees to protect senior debt holders and subordinate bond holders is a failed strategy.  The bondholders have been protected by the Government and the Government would not negotiate discounts until after the announcement today.  Despite the altruistic policy, we have reached the stage whereby the forthcoming bond auction has had to be cancelled and the credit worthiness of the sovereign State is gone.  The Government, like a losing gambler, is doubling its bet in the vain hope of a win on the last race.This morning's announcement continues with a failed Government policy.  The Minister for Finance is committing a further €16 billion or thereabouts of taxpayers' money to the banks and signalling that he will impose further pain on the taxpayer.  If I understand his statement correctly, the €3 billion adjustment he has signalled for the forthcoming  budget of 7 December will be insufficient and he will have to make adjustments of substantially greater than €3 billion.  He has also signalled that he will, in November, profile in detail the tax increases and expenditure cuts he or his successors will introduce in the three subsequent budgets.  My understanding of the nature of this type of profiling is that the Government will not be able to do as it did three days ago when it announced plans to create 300,000 jobs because Brussels will not accept smoke and mirrors on budgetary profiles.  On the contrary, when the Minister nominates the cuts he will have to underpin every one of them with a policy decision.

The Minister has a great nerve, with a couple of months to go in the life of this Administration, to commit a subsequent Government to budgetary profiles for the next four years.I return to the issue of bondholders because it is crucial to this debate.  Negotiating agreed discounts with bondholders is not a novel idea.  I recall from the dim and distant past economic lectures on the theory of banking — the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, will also remember them — which featured a straight hierarchy of debt.  Those who bought shares were buying risk capital and could lose everything.  Subordinated debt holders — the bondholders — who received a higher return and interest rate were next in line for a hit if there was insufficient money in the equity stake to cover liabilities.  One then had senior debt holders who were not equated with deposit holders.

The senior debt holders were next in line after subordinated debt holders and deposit holders were to take the last hit.  Democracies, in their prudence, have introduced statutory schemes to protect deposit holders.  The scheme in place here used to protect deposits of up to €20,000 but the figure was increased to €100,000 during the Minister's time in office, which was a very good idea.  This was the hierarchy of debt.The Minister for Finance is aware, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, that the protocols and regulations governing these matters were negotiated in what is known as the Basel agreement.  A new Basel agreement is being negotiated by all the European states.  A draft protocol of this new agreement which can be found on the Internet adopts precisely the same policy.  Under this policy, the hierarchy of risk is as I have outlined in the event of a bank in difficulty being wound down.

Last night, I asked him to give a commitment to introduce bank resolution legislation similar to that being drawn up all over Europe.  There is a gap in the statutory policy instruments available to central banks and many countries in Europe, including Ireland, for dealing with the wind-down of a bank.  I ask the Minister to legislate in order that the Governor of the Central Bank will have legal authority to act in the manner I have described.

When I asked him to do this in October he stated he could not do so and he now proposes to do it in autumn.  In which autumn of which year will it be done?I am pleased to note from the Minister's statement this morning that he will introduce such legislation and is in discussion with the Financial Regulator and Central Bank.  As with everything the Government does, action on this matter is being taken too late.  The Minister claimed several times that he is giving certainty to the market.  How many times did he hear us pleading with him to give certainty to the market?  How many interviews have been given by me, Deputies Richard Bruton, Alan Shatter, Enda Kenny——

Instead of using the €2.5 billion provided for in the NAMA business plan to pay smart accountants to go through the files one by one, he could have done what he now proposes, namely, take a tranche of loans, sample it, arrive at a discount and proceed with the transfer.

It must be allowed if the Commissioner has agreed to it.  The reason the Minister is able to state that the remaining bad debts in Anglo Irish Bank will be transferred to NAMA in one tranche and will no longer be taken sequentially is that sampling has been done to enable the transfer to proceed.While certainty has been provided about what will be done with Allied Irish Banks and Irish Nationwide, the Minister's attitude to the Educational Building Society does not provide certainty.  This is a very important issue.  We all know the EBS is on the market but the Minister did not indicate when NAMA will make a decision in the matter.  I do not understand the reason it takes so long to examine four bids.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The changes with regard to the National Asset Management Agency are good.  It was ridiculous that every debt above €5 million was the subject of transfer when all the main banks have large units trained to work out, with the banks' clients, the wind-down of debt that cannot be paid.  A threshold of €20 million is much more reasonable.NAMA also made a mistake in responding to political comment by crystallising major debt much too quickly on the transfers.  This was not necessary, particularly given that the liability only arises when the debt is crystallised.  While we may praise ourselves for full transparency, if the debts had not been crystallised at such a rapid pace, the bills would not be coming in so quickly.A secondary effect of raising the ceiling to €20 million is that debts of this order will not crystallise as quickly.  There are 620 people who have debts of between €5 million and €20 million according to the figures provided.  This gives certainty and is, therefore, worthwhile.This morning, the Minister referred to the manner in which the money being transferred to the various institutions will appear in the national accounts.  I ask him to elaborate on this matter in greater detail.I understood the Minister to say that the fiscal deficit in 2010 will be 32%, an extraordinary figure.  The promissory note is going into Anglo Irish Bank but the actual turn into cash happens over a number of years.  From the EUROSTAT point of view, is the whole promissory note taken into account in 2010?  More importantly, will that follow into the accounts of 2011?

Does he remember our arguing that he should not have sanctioned an internal appointment to the role of chief executive but should have insisted on an outside person?  I am glad he has moved to that position.  However, when I last looked, 60% of the directors who were in AIB when the bad decisions were made were still in place.  There was something similar in Bank of Ireland.  They should be all cleared out.  I am not saying they are culpable but it happened on their watch.  When the Minister's friends sitting behind him face the electorate, although they are not personally culpable they are still going to get shot.

Tallaght is a lovely place.  I cannot wax as eloquently as Deputy O'Connor about it but it is a lovely place.This morning's announcement by the Minister of the complex set of arrangements he has made to further acknowledge the level of the crisis that has convulsed the Irish banking system has probably introduced levels of fear and trepidation among ordinary people.  The blanket bailout of the banks two years ago, which the Government called "the cheapest bailout in the world", has turned into a disaster of historic proportions.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan stands before us today, having brought us news of the largest bank bailout, proportionate to the nation's wealth, of any country in the world.  One would probably have to go back to 19th century South America to find failures and commitments on such a spectacular scale.Yesterday, there were tense exchanges between Opposition leaders and the Taoiseach as to why the extended liabilities guarantee was going through last night without the information being provided to the House as to what  — and I put the question specifically when I spoke last night and others did as well — would be the further commitments to Anglo Irish and what would be the further commitments to Irish Nationwide and Allied Irish Bank.  The response of the Taoiseach, who is the Prime Minister of our country, was that on the eve of today's momentous announcement he did not know.  That seems an odd way to run a Government.  One of the strange things about Ireland is that over the two years of this crisis the governance of Ireland, by this Government and the people who assist it, has failed the Irish people to a very significant extent.Last night and this morning, however, the Financial Times devoted two pages to an interview, given in the daytime yesterday by the Minister for Finance, in which he set out all of the figures in quite considerable detail.  What is the significance of this?

I met them.  I am quite sure people from Fine Gael met them also.  We were briefed that this was happening.  This is putting us back into the 19th century.This is what the Minister had to say in the Financial Times, which reports:The failure of Anglo Irish Bank, the lender at the centre of the country's financial crisis would, "bring down Ireland" the country's finance minister said, as he vowed the country would stand behind the institution.  Doing this will raise the cost of its taxpayer-funded banking bailout up to €35 billion.That is the figure the Minister gave to the Financial Times  yesterday.

Is he convinced at this stage that he has resolved matters as they relate to Anglo Irish Bank?  Shortly after the extension of the guarantee to that institution — either in late 2008 or early 2009 — I put a proposal to the House to the effect that an inspector should be appointed to oversee its affairs.  I did so because on St. Patrick’s Day 2009, in another interview which appeared in the international edition of the Financial Times, the Minister stated that the cause of the destruction of the Irish banking system was crony capitalism.  I have the relevant pages from the newspaper if the Minister wants them.

A second article in the newspaper states that Anglo Irish Bank’s top ten borrowers accounted for more than half its loans.  The Financial Times is simply repeating for the world what most Irish people already know, namely, that the core group of customers of Anglo Irish Bank comprised ten major developers with loans ranging from €1 billion to €2 billion or €3 billion.  However, the bank’s key portfolio of loans was made up of 100 big developers.

Anyone in business would know that if one is involved in a receivership or a liquidation, the notion that it would take more than two years to clarify the position in respect of 100 accounts is utterly——
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	342	It is not 100 accounts, it is a multiplicity of accounts.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Why does the Deputy not listen?  He might learn something.  The notion that it would take more than two years to resolve matters relating to a group of 100 customers is entirely extraordinary.  This leads me to the view that the fundamental cause of what happened in Anglo Irish Bank was a failure of political governance as a result of the influence of the type of crony capitalism to which the Minister referred in his interview with the  Financial Times on St. Patrick’s Day in 2009.  The interview to which I refer appeared on the front page of that publication and continued on one of the inside pages.  I am sure the Minister remembers the interview well because it was given significant coverage.The Minister has made a disastrous series of connected blunders in respect of his handling of the Anglo Irish Bank crisis, which has brought the remaining elements of the banking system that were capable of being saved to the brink of destruction.

Effectively, that institution will have become almost a nationalised entity by the time the process the Minister described concludes.  Then there is Irish Nationwide, a tiny building society which has placed taxpayers — those who elect us to the Dáil — on the hook for over €5 billion.  Can Members believe that?Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have always been at the rotten heart of Fianna Fáil strategy in respect of the bank guarantee.  Fianna Fáil did not care that much about Bank of Ireland, AIB or the other institutions.  All it cared about was its crony financial institutions, namely, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, and the developers to whom they had loaned money.  The two Brians, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, hoped against hope that somehow or other the country would turn a number of corners and that this would make matters less bad then they appeared.Today, we have been given more bad news about the two institutions to which I refer.  The Financial Times states that the cost in respect of Anglo Irish Bank will be €35 billion and €5 billion for the tiny building society that is known as Irish Nationwide.  That is the pass to which the Minister and his leader, the Taoiseach, have brought this country.  Today is “Black Thursday” and the Minister and his party, Fianna Fáil, will be remembered for visiting it upon this country.The Minister stated that Commissioner Almunia welcomed what has happened.  What has the Minister promised the Commissioner in return for saying that?

In the statement to which I refer, the Minister said:  "It is important that we have a credible path to show how we propose to meet this commitment.  Accordingly, a four year budgetary plan, incorporating the annual measures will be published in early November".  Has that been agreed with the European Commission?I do not know what is the correct adjective for barrister.

Unfortunately, that is not what the Government has provided during the past three years.  I argued with the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance about contracts for difference.  I told him it would turn the Irish Stock Exchange, consisting of a small number of shares concentrated in banks property and construction, into a casino, and I got the brush off.  Month in and month out I told him that the property-based tax breaks were blowing up a financial bubble, but he would not believe it.  I subsequently repeatedly told him that what was happening in the models for growth we were witnessing was unsustainable.  The former Taoiseach told us that it constituted talking down the economy and people doing so should go off and commit suicide.Today is a day of infamy in Ireland; it is Black Thursday.  We have heard about €50 billion of costs and losses to be borne on the backs of the poor Irish people in this generation, the next generation and probably generations still to be born.  This week the Germans finally finished paying off their war debt, not arising from the Second World War but from the First World War.  This is the legacy Fianna Fáil is now proposing to place on us.  It was announced not to our native Parliament of which, for all its faults, we are all so proud and for which our forefathers fought to get, but to the Financial Times of London, while the Taoiseach sat where the Minister is now sitting and told Deputies Kenny and Gilmore he knew nothing about it.

Both parents might have been working, with perhaps one self-employed and one in the public service.  Their mortgage repayments are often from €1,200 to €2,500 a month and they are now in serious negative equity.In the 1930s there were films, including Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds goes to Town", about bankers who stole little people's money and lives.  In all of the Minister's announcement of the €50 billion for Anglo Irish Bank, the Irish Nationwide Building Society and others, there is not a word for those little people.  He does not even talk about how he might approach his four-year plan and explain the kind of pain he has in mind which he will bequeath to the Opposition should the Government decide finally to go to the country and retire Fianna Fáil from government.  It is long past its retirement time.

The Minister compromised the NTMA by placing NAMA in it.  Even at this point the Minister could reverse that decision before Ireland re-opens the auctions to the bond markets.  Why was NAMA not put into, for example, the Central Bank?  The Minister decided to put it into the NTMA so that the principal people in the NTMA would not just have the responsibility for looking after selling Irish bonds but would also need to look after the mess that is NAMA.  From a management point of view, it was a serious strategic error to mix up the two.  In the time before we go back into bond auctions I advise the Minister to seriously reconsider what he did there.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Projecting the cost of the Anglo Irish Bank bailout as €29.3 billion is completely sly when admitting in the same breath that the final cost will most likely rise to €34.3 billion, in the event of further losses.  We have been told that the €34.3 billion figure is a worst-case scenario, but we must remember that all aspects of the Government's banking strategy have been the worst case scenario up to now.  When the Minister for Finance told us two years ago that the worst was over, the worst had not even begun.  When, according to the Minister, the worst was over, the cost of the overall bank bailout of nearly €50 billion had not even surfaced.  When the Minister first proposed nationalising Anglo Irish Bank in January 2009, he estimated that it would cost €4.5 billion.  Government policy is like watching economics for slow learners.  It takes it years to decide anything and when it does, it is the most costly and worst option.Concerns about the Government's ability to pay for the banking bailouts have pushed Irish State borrowing costs to record levels.  Because of the financial impact of the guarantee, the borrowing and the recapitalisation of the banks, Ireland's debt is now being serviced at a record Irish and EU high of 6.8%.The prospect of the Government taking a majority shareholding and control of AIB is now inevitable and has been since the outset of this crisis.  AIB should have been nationalised two years ago, as advocated by Sinn Féin.  Such swift and decisive action two years ago would have dealt with credit streams to SMEs and households, and it would have stabilised the banking sector.The impact this bailout will have on the Irish deficit is enormous.  The Government's goal to come back within the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact by 2014 has been blown out of the water.  Today's estimates will mean the Government has less money to spend and will have to introduce an even tougher budget in December.  Almost every cut that is being made is to fund the Government's failed banking policy.  Where will the growth come from to bridge the chasm between what the Government is spending on the banks and what it is taking in?  The bill for this bailout will bankrupt the State.  The reality is that Ireland is bust and faces a potential Greek-style crisis.Bondholders lent private money to private banks, not to the State.  They did not lend the money for infrastructural investment or to create jobs; they lent their money for a high return.  The Government warns that cutting Anglo Irish Bank's bondholders would kill demand for Irish sovereign debt.  The opposite is true as record-high sovereign spreads show.  The open-ended exposure to private liabilities across the banking system drives up sovereign yields.  While the State continues to promise it will fund Anglo Irish Bank's bondholders, the prognosis for financial institutions and the State's own sovereign debt remains uncertain.Why should we socialise the losses of the financial sector?  Why should we inflict pain on our people for the failings of capitalism, liberal markets and unbelievably greedy bankers and speculators?  It is demanded of us that the economy be hamstrung by pay cuts, job losses and privatisation while servicing an increased level of debt.  Reducing incomes while increasing sovereign debt only raises the risk of default, hence yields will continue to rise.  A crucial, yet widely ignored point from Standard & Poor's when downgrading Irish debt is that the austerity measures have depressed activity and tax revenues.  This slash-and-burn approach does not work and only increases the budget deficits and the interest rates on Government debt.No matter what language the Government tries to hide behind, the taxpayer still has to pay for the Anglo Irish Bank debacle.  Public funds are being pumped into these banks while public services and welfare are ruthlessly cut to try to bridge the gap in the public finances.  Our Government's banking policy makes the mistakes in Iceland look tame.Feeding the opportunistic bank bondholders is killing economies in trouble.  If an economy does not grow but tries to pay back huge debts, it will turn into a debt-servicing agency which hollows out the productive marrow of society.  The Government has placed international bondholders above every man, woman and child in this State, on this, the worst day for our economy in history.  Black Thursday is as good a name as any to attribute to it.The Government's credibility is contaminated by the banks.  Our banking system is crippled and having a serious impact on our sovereign debt.  The markets want growth; anything that strangles growth scares them.  The State's sovereign debt has become tied to our banking institutions.  The most recent increases in interest rates on State bonds were directly linked to the uncertainty surrounding Anglo Irish Bank and Ireland's ability to pay for the bank's debts.Ireland will fill economics books of the future with tales of pathetic and, in many cases, corrupt economic management.  Those who run our country recklessly fuelled the boom with disastrous consequences.  Now, in the bust, they are making things considerably worse.  The problem for us is that the very people who did not see the bust coming and cheer-led the country over a cliff are still in power.In advance of the 2007 general election, Fianna Fáil told the electorate the economy was fine and built on solid foundations when clearly it was not.  Today Fianna Fáil, and especially the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, lies to the public when it claims nobody warned of the pending economic crisis.  This is to hide its culpability in the financial and banking crisis faced by the State.The bill for the bank bailouts has escalated to €50 billion.  The Government has done more to ruin this State's future in one day than any other single body, institution or group ever did.  We are being deliberately sabotaged by a Government that also has the neck to defend arrogantly what it has brought down upon the people of this State for generations.  This was a home-grown crisis, fuelled by the culture of greed and corruption of successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  It was the dismantling of regulation by the Government, coupled with its pro real estate policies, that brought this financial and banking crisis to fruition.Today, Sinn Féin tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance, the very Minister entrusted with the financial security of the State, who has led Ireland on a trajectory of perpetual debt for generations to come and who will savage public services for the people of the State in next December's budget.The motion reads:That Dáil Éireann, expressing its serious concerns about revelations in RTE "Freefall" documentary on Monday, 6 September 2010 that Bank of Ireland chairman, Richard Burrows, and chief executive, Brian Goggin, were informed by Anglo Irish Bank chairman, Seán FitzPatrick, and chief executive, David Drumm, that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and requested a takeover of the bank;noting that immediately following this meeting Bank of Ireland management then contacted AIB and both banks immediately sought a meeting with the Minster for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan;further noting that following these meetings the Minister introduced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill 2008, the bank guarantee on 30 September 2008 claiming in the Dáil that the purpose of the guarantee was to deal with liquidity or cash flow issues within the Irish banking system;deplores the fact that the reality of the situation in Anglo Irish Bank was not revealed to the Dáil by the Minister before the passing of the guarantee;noting that due to the financial impact of the guarantee and the subsequent borrowing and the recapitalization of the banks that the State's debt is now being serviced at a record Irish and EU high of 6.8%;noting that the estimated cost of the Government's banking policy has continued to spiral out of control;noting that new estimates for the capital and recapitalisation costs of Anglo Irish Bank will reach €34.3 billion and that the total cost of the bank bailout will reach €49.3 billionhas no confidence in the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.I note Deputy Noonan's similar sentiments earlier.  I invite the Deputy and the Fine Gael Party to consider giving some of their parliamentary time to allow this motion of no confidence to be tabled so we can expose the gross mismanagement of the State's finances.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	385	We need an immediate exit strategy.  This can be achieved through the creation of a State bank by nationalising the positive assets, including the deposits and performing loans of AIB and Bank of Ireland, and transferring them into such a new bank.  It can also be achieved by allowing the bank guarantee to lapse, for the remaining assets of AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Nationwide to be divided up between the bondholders of those institutions, and securing all deposits in the State bank, given that all its activities would be under sovereign guarantee.It is becoming increasingly clear the Government will bankrupt the State if we continue to repay the bondholders.  The bondholders must be cut loose and the guarantee allowed to lapse.  The taxpayer has no obligation to repay both senior and subordinated bondholders at Anglo Irish Bank on the grounds that the terms of these securities allow for the possibility of them not being paid back if the bank is insolvent.  This is why banks get to count these securities as part of their regulatory capital.  Furthermore, none of this debt matures until 2014 at the earliest and these bonds will no longer be covered by a State guarantee.All the banks are to varying degrees zombified, being unable or unwilling to provide credit to the economy.  We must, therefore, transfer the deposits into a new, single, State bank which would be safe and thus re-open credit streams.Through public ownership, the State will be in a position to directly control finance and ensure credit is injected into the real economy.  Scarce public funds should not be used to continue to bail out bondholders from their own reckless behaviour.  It is time the Government accepted that the current strategy to restore our banking system has failed.Ireland and Europe operate under a financial system called capitalism.  That system prescribes that if a business venture fails, then the loss arising falls on the shoulders of the investors.  These bondholders were private investors investing in private enterprises.  Why is the Government changing the rules in this case? Is it so it benefits its cronies?On "Morning Ireland", the Minister for Finance used an analogy about the consequences of a sovereign debt default.  He compared it to telling one's bank manager that one will not repay one's existing loans but is looking for a new loan anyway which would, naturally, lead to a refusal.  That is, however, grossly misleading.  Why would the State not receive a loan from the bond markets?  It has always honoured its sovereign debt commitments.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, it is a case of private bondholders funding private banks, so this analogy is not true.  Unfortunately, the Government seems to have been getting away with this argument so far.  An exit strategy from the current debt crisis is imperative and a new system of public banking must be established.An economic policy that is reduced to focusing solely on saving banks and reducing a deficit, without any attention to the growth side, is doomed to failure.  The Government has committed to put in whatever capital is necessary for splitting Anglo Irish Bank in two and its subsequent recapitalisation, with today's figures peaking at a whopping €34.3 billion, but the economy outside the banks is being grossly neglected.The Government claims that the overriding priority is to reduce the public sector deficit to the Maastricht treaty limit to 3% of GDP by 2013/14, and that massive cuts to spending will achieve that.  Sinn Féin disagrees on all counts.  Our overwhelming priority is the economy, restoring growth, reversing the tide of business bankruptcies, getting people back into work and restoring funding to our schools, hospitals and investment in our infrastructure.  These are the policies that will actually secure deficit reduction, as tax revenues rise and welfare outlays lower as people are brought back into employment.The deficit is a symptom of the crisis, not its cause.  The deficit appeared precisely at the time of the recession; before then the Exchequer annual returns were in modest surpluses.  Government policy has exacerbated that deficit, producing the highest in the euro area at 14.3% of GDP.  The underlying deficit, excluding the extra money that can always seem to be found for bank recapitalisations, is still an enormous 11.6% of GDP.Government policy is a complete failure, even on its own terms.  No reputable international or domestic agency, IMF, OECD, EU or the ESRI believes the 2013/14 target will be met and most forecast the deficit will rise further in the short term.  All these agencies concede that the prospects for reducing the deficit are dependent on the levels of growth achieved over the medium term.  This is the real determinant of the deficit.  The bitter experience of the last two years is that cutting spending has weakened growth and therefore led to a wider deficit.  A pro-growth strategy is required to revive economic activity and narrow the deficit over the medium term.  This would include investment in growth-enhancing education, research and development, infrastructure, health and child care.It is claimed that further cuts of at least €3 billion will be required as the domestic crisis deepens.  This is the madness of repeating a policy which has already failed.  The cuts have failed in their stated objective; the opposite course is actually required.  Just as lower Government spending sharpens the downturn, lowers tax revenues and increases welfare outlays, so increased Government spending can do the opposite.  That is the way to close the deficit through Government investment.The continuing problems of the economy here are entirely homegrown.  The Government provides money to financial institutions in previously unimaginable quantities but there is no control over the use of money, no safeguarding of the essential economic functions and no accountability for the damage that has been done.  The decision of this Government today is frightening.  I do not believe the Government has a mandate to exercise such a decision.  If the Government refuses an election to allow the people to decide on the enormity of what is happening, the least it should do is to allow people to share their opinions through a referendum.  Future generations will remember this as a black day.

I do not have an economic background so I do not approach this from that angle but from the point of view of the ordinary person, who is appalled and disgusted by what they see happening here.  It appears there is a bottomless pit of money and guarantees when it comes to banks but when it comes to the needs and lives of Irish people, they are told they must accept the cuts and make the sacrifices, that it is acceptable to lose their homes and jobs, that it is acceptable to lose special needs assistants, and that communities must accept that they will lose those supports that have made such a difference.On Monday, the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs attended an exhibition in Liberty Hall that was organised by the north inner city drugs task force, featuring a number of projects from groups in the north inner city that work with marginalised and vulnerable people, those in addiction, people from minority groups and those working with those at risk of suicide and other high risk cases.  He saw the tremendous work being done by those projects on shoestring budgets.  They have been cut already and must now accept further cuts.This morning at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs we were reminded of the increases in the numbers of people living in hunger and poverty.  A fraction of what is going to the banks would make a huge difference in the areas I have mentioned.There is a sense that if the banks fail it will be the end of the world but banks have failed in other countries and those countries have survived and improved economically.  There must be a limit, a bottom line, because the pit is not bottomless.  Reckless financial and fiscal management are at the core of what is happening in this country.  When will those exorbitant salaries, bonuses and expenses enjoyed by executives in State and semi-State bodies and in the higher echelons of the universities and the Civil Service be tackled and ended?  At the other extreme, there are people talking about the effect missing out on the Christmas bonus last year has had on their lives.The Minister is convinced this is the way forward but the facts say otherwise.  What do we get for this money being diverted to banks?  It will not create jobs or pay for our children's education, it will not provide health or social services.  The way we treat the vulnerable and marginalised is a mark of a civilised society but I do not see too many marks of civilisation in this country.  It is unbelievable that we must accept pure financial fiction and economic treason.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I thank the Taoiseach, the party leaders and the Ceann Comhairle for giving us this rare opportunity to address the Chamber on an issue of such importance.When this crisis originally broke on 30 September 2008, I was a member of Fianna Fáil.  I was under the party whip and supported the measures passed in law in that week.  I opposed the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank because I was not convinced of the arguments made by the Government at the time.  The Government succeeded on that occasion, however, and the country now owning Anglo Irish Bank means that we must make our decisions based on the situation as it stands, and we must cope with the consequences of past decisions.  On that basis I have supported further elements of the Government's response to the banking crisis, including the decision made here last night.  I will continue to evaluate the proposals made by the Government on that basis, the basis of where we are and the best for the country.I have often tried to put myself in the position the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were in on the night the guarantee was decided to see if I would have acted differently.  Not having the information available to them, it is difficult to do that but if they were faced with the collapse of the entire banking system in the following days, it is difficult to blame them for making the decisions they made, decisions that were made in good conscience and for the right reasons.  I do not condemn them for their efforts to avert that crisis and to manage the situation from there on.I have not been impressed with any of the proposals made by any of the Opposition parties with regard to their response to the banking crisis either.  Each of them has lacked credibility and it is very difficult to believe that they would have made very different decisions had they been in government on that occasion two years ago.

#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	389	It is my belief, for what it is worth.One thing which is now becoming very clear, apart from the clarity around how much money this will cost the State, which will possibly be up to €50 billion that we may or may not get back, from listening to the Governor of the Central Bank on the news today is that the representatives of the Government, the Central Bank and others were misled by the banking institutions of this country.  It is clear that the mess we are in now is partly because the full facts were not given to the Government at the earliest stages by the banks.  That is a very serious matter because the people are Ireland are going to pay for it, if it was deception.I know the Minister will answer questions at the end of this debate.  I would like the Minister to answer a number of questions.  Was he misled at any stage in this process over the past two years by senior management or bank directors of the main banking institutions in this country?  If he was misled, in what way was he misled?  I would also like him to identify those people who misled him, if they did so.  Has he or does he intend to call in any of the law enforcement agencies to investigate the manner in which he may have been misled?  We are all entitled to that information.It has also been indicated by the Minister for Finance today that the Government will shortly prepare a four year strategic plan to help us out of the great hole we are in.  I want to put my position on the record on this.  I will scrutinise that plan whenever it is brought before the Dáil with great care and attention but I could not, at this point in time, pledge my support for a plan which is not founded on basic principles of social justice.  I hope that when decisions are made which will bring us along the next step of this path that the cares and concerns of the most marginalised people in the country are foremost in the minds of the members of the Cabinet.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking to this important and urgent debate on the announcement by the Minister for Finance on banking.  Before I go into the details of the debate it is important to state that some senior bankers misled and lied to politicians in this House.  As a result of their actions, they contributed towards making the situation worse.  That is my position.  This was crime against our people and the taxpayers and an insult to all elected members of this House.  It is important that this is said today in this debate.  It it is important that it is said on behalf of the 455,000 unemployed people in the country.We can talk about banking and the huge greed and mistakes which were made all day, but the results of the banks' actions have to be dealt with first.  Since the summer the numbers out of work have soared to 455,000, the highest since the live register began in 1967.  At the same time the Government has already committed to spending €25 billion on the banking black hole.  The Government's plan is not working and that is the reality.  We have already seen three deflationary budgets and a fourth is looming.  Taking another €3 billion out of the economy will lead to further job losses.  Pay and welfare cuts were imposed in last year's budget and the numbers out of work have climbed steadily since.  This is the reality for most people on the ground but the Government still needs to wake up to this reality.We need a plan for jobs and growth.  No strategy currently exists to get people back to work or to keep them working and this is a major concern for me.  Almost every other EU state has a job protection scheme in place and in some countries, such as Germany, unemployment has already started to fall.  The final bill for the bank bailout will rise.  The bill for Anglo Irish Bank alone could rise to €35 billion or more.  Even conservative voices such as the Financial Times and Barclays bank say our banking plan is lunacy because it places the entire burden on the taxpayer.  This is the key issue in this debate today.  I am putting forward constructive proposals to try to solve the problem.We need to prioritise jobs and growth.  We cannot cut our way out of this crisis.  It is not working and the past two years have proved this.  We also need to end the uncertainty which currently exists in this country.  I have proposed the idea of a job strategy to assist the unemployed.  For example, in my constituency of Dublin North-Central I proposed a plan that every person spend an extra €20 per week.  I have targeted this campaign at people over 50 years of age who have a few bob in savings — I understand there is in the region of €75 billion in savings in the country.  If such people spent €20 per week extra in their own communities we could create an extra 20,000 jobs in the country.  I refer to local businesses, stores, printing companies and things like that in every Deputy's constituency.  It is a sensible and logical proposal.When we are discussing turning the economy around we should listen to the calls from SIPTU, OPEN, the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed and Mental Health Ireland when they refer to the 20,000 jobs in the community employment schemes which provide very valuable services, as Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned in her speech, in communities.  I have seen these services on the ground, including educational services, after school projects and services for homeless people, and the projects and people who work in them will be cut in the budget.  I ask the Minister to end the madness.  We have 20,000 people making a contribution to their communities.If the Government is serious about tackling the economy it also has to make job creation part of the solution.  Job creation equals tax revenue and happy families and people.  Think about it; that is the way out of this mess.  It is important that we think outside the box, that is, that we consider sectors of Irish society which are already making massive contributions to this country.  I refer to the arts sector which already has in the region of 95,649 jobs.  I also welcome the fact that there are 5,500 full-time jobs in the audiovisual sector, with more than 560 small and medium sized enterprises operating in the sector.  I welcome the contribution made by the arts.  This is an angle for job creation in the areas of culture and tourism, and investment in the country is important.I recently heard that the chief executive of Coca Cola said in the US that the brand Ireland was one of the most well-known names there.  We should use that creatively to project the vision for this country and it has the potential for job creation.  Earlier, I heard the Minister for Finance state the urgent need to reinforce international market confidence in the restoration of our banking system to health and our capacity to take the steps essential to achieving the enduring sustainability of our budgetary position.  He also said in his speech that international financial markets have been clamouring for some time for greater certainty on the final cost of repairing the substantial damage wrought by irresponsible and reckless lending practices and systematic failures in corporate governance and risk management.  That is the reality and most Deputies in this House would identity those issues.The Minister also referred to the public anger.  Not only is the public angry, it is furious.  The people of Donnycarney, Marino, Edenmore, Clontarf, Beaumont, Artane and Drumcondra are furious about the way this situation has evolved and the perception and reality for many people is that the people responsible are getting away with this.  We need to identify and deal with this issue in a just and fair way.  I strongly believe that Ireland should be a just and equal society.  At the moment, there does not seem to be any justice for regular and decent taxpayers and the unemployed people of this country.  It is a disgrace and a scandal that people are literally getting away with murder.  Equally, it is a disgrace that the Government is not prepared to listen to the sensible proposals of other political parties for dealing with this country's economic crisis.

We should all cop on and support such ideas.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	394	That is the reality of what many people were saying to me on the doorsteps and at my clinics over the summer period.I wish to offer a few proposals to the Minister for Finance.  I would love to see him reduce tax breaks for the wealthy to EU levels; to introduce a wealth tax for high earners with assets worth more than €1 million; to end tax exile loopholes by making citizenship the basis for taxation for high earners; and to apply PRSI and income levies to all income, regardless of source.  I ask the Minister to consider such constructive ideas, even if they might not be trendy or popular.  If we are to make our way out of this mess, we will have to face reality.  Although recent opinion polls have suggested that many people want public expenditure to be cut, I strongly believe that part of the solution must involve an equitable and fair taxation system.  I accept that may be a minority view.We need to reflect on the reality that our low taxation regime is not working.  There is a deeply ingrained belief in Ireland that a low taxation regime is needed to encourage entrepreneurship, investment, employment and wealth creation.  However, countries with higher taxation regimes outperform Ireland on economic competitiveness, quality of public services and enterprise supports, and also have lower levels of poverty and inequality.  I ask the Government to study the economies of such countries.  Another common myth is that high earners pay disproportionately high levels of tax.  I hear this in the media every second night of the week.  In fact, high income earners pay less in tax than is popularly believed, largely as a result of generous tax breaks to reduce their tax bills.  Ireland spends over three times the EU norm on various tax expenditures, including tax breaks and reliefs.  In 2009, the State lost €7.4 billion on tax expenditures.  The Commission on Taxation has identified over 100 tax expenditures, which cost the State over €8 billion.I would like to make a sensible proposal on that basis. If we want the quality of our public services and economic investment to be at European levels, we need to move to European levels of taxation over the medium term.  I accept this might not be trendy or popular.  If we are serious about tackling inequality and this country's major economic crisis, we need to take tough decisions.  I suggest we should make such decisions on behalf of the 450,000 unemployed people in this country.  Those who are lucky enough to be working have a responsibility to look after the 14% of people who are unemployed.  We should not back down from tough decisions of this kind.  I will conclude by asking the Government to listen to sensible proposals for dealing with this economic crisis because we need to work together to get out of this mess.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The Minister for Finance is quoted in this morning's Financial Times as saying the failure of Anglo Irish Bank would “bring down” this country.  I wish to make it clear that the failure of the Minister’s banking policy and his catastrophic misjudgment throughout the banking crisis have put Ireland’s economic future at risk.  For the first time in its history, this country is unable to access the markets.  If this happened in any other situation of government, there would be mass resignations.  The figures unveiled by the Minister this morning are absolutely horrendous and appalling.  It is beyond the scope of most ordinary people to comprehend them.  It appears that up to €34 billion of State money will be put into Anglo Irish Bank and almost €5.5 billion will be put into Irish Nationwide.  We are aware that €6.5 billion has been put into AIB and €3.5 billion has been put into Bank of Ireland so far.  These are astronomical figures.  The total losses will come to at least €40 billion.  That figure does not include the potential losses associated with NAMA.  The Minister is well aware that many external commentators with a strong record in predicting banking losses have suggested that NAMA might lose up to €15 billion.While those figures are shocking, some other figures are even more shocking.  There are 450,000 people on the live register.  Some 200,000 jobs have been lost since the introduction of the bank guarantee.  By April of next year, 100,000 people will have emigrated.  Some 2,500 people have their electricity supplies cut off each month.  Approximately 200,000 mortgages are in negative equity.  Does the Government not understand the emotional and economic pressures being faced by families throughout the country?  The problems of the Ireland of 2010 have been caused by the political failure to see what was happening and to drive the country as we would want, with growth and with prudence.  It is catastrophic that the Government has allowed a relatively small number of people to drive this country to the edge of an economic abyss.  Nobody has paid the penalty under the law of the land.  As I said this morning, a man who was unable to pay a fine of €250 was sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment in Mountjoy Prison and will have a criminal record for the rest of his life.Many words, including "failed", "incompetent", "arrogant" and "wrong", could be used to describe the approach of the Minister for Finance to the banking crisis.  Just one word — "unfair" — really captures the essence of what the Minister and his Government colleagues have done, however.  Over the last two years, they had a clear choice between protecting the people of the country and bailing out reckless investors and even more reckless bankers.  On every occasion, they chose to put the bankers before the people.  Fine Gael would have handled things very differently if it had been in government during that time.  Our policy has been very clear from the beginning of this crisis.  We argued that Anglo Irish Bank could not survive as a commercial entity and needed to be wound down.  After more than a year of denying reality, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has finally acknowledged the inevitable by starting to wind the bank down.  It is too late, as usual.  It was suggested in this House that such a decision could not be taken under any circumstances because it would be catastrophic.  Fine Gael's analysis of what should be done to deal with the Anglo Irish Bank crisis has been proven right.Fine Gael also argued that even if NAMA were established, the Irish banks would not lend and would not be in a position to lend.  We proposed the creation of a national recovery bank to make sure small and medium sized enterprises get the credit they desperately need.  This was rubbished by the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues.  The Minister told the people of Ireland that the establishment of NAMA would unleash a wave of credit — it was described as a "wall of cash".  Where is that wall of cash?  Where is the wave of credit?  We all know the answer — it never happened.  Under the Government's failed banking strategy, it can never happen.  What would the Minister say to the businessman who told me the other day that although his business has a turnover of over €1 million, the bank offered him an overdraft of €5,000?  One cannot run a sweetshop in that situation.Above all, Fine Gael argues that it was completely unfair for the Irish people to have to shoulder all of the losses of the banking catastrophe .  It was only fair that the people who had lent recklessly to the banks should also share in the pain.  What we were arguing for is nothing very revolutionary, it is a basic rule of capitalism; if one lends recklessly to failed institutions one must take the consequences.However, the Minister for Finance and the Government decided instead that they were going to nationalise the losses of the banking system and make the people of the country pay the price for the mistakes of others.  That is what they have done and that is what has crushed the spirit of thousands of our people, caused them uncertainty, disillusionment, anxiety and fear, and left a generation of young people considering their futures, many of whom have now left for the United States, Australia and other foreign climes.  This is the sad consequence of a failed banking strategy by a Government that was unable to see the way ahead and find appropriate solutions.The Government and the Minister of the Finance trotted out the big lie that there was no alternative.  They and the bankers told the people that if they applied these simple rules of capitalism the international markets would desert us; that the only way to keep open these markets was for the Irish people to pump billions of their money into a failed banking system.  Even on his own terms the Minister for Finance has completely failed in this regard.  The markets he wanted to keep open are now closed to Ireland and the bondholders he tried so hard to please have turned their backs on Ireland.  That is why, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, the country's bond auctions have been cancelled.  The Government knows full well that if they were held the sovereign would either fail to raise the money or the interest rates we would have to pay would be extortionate.  That is the consequence of poor political judgment in dealing with the options that were presented.  It is the Minister for Finance and his policies that have closed the markets to Ireland; our policies — the Fine Gael policy — would have kept them open.The very least the Irish people deserve from the Government, and from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in particular, is that they should apologise for their actions, for their incompetence and unfairness and for their complete lack of understanding about how financial markets actually work.  Instead they are still trying to run for cover.  I heard the radio interview with the Minister for Finance this morning.  He got annoyed when the interviewer reminded the listeners of his statement that the bank guarantee was the cheapest bailout in the world.  He told her that was not accurate and that what he had actually said was that it was the cheapest bailout in the world so far.  A fine lawyer's distinction.What the Minister said almost two years ago was that the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank would cost €1.5 billion; he did not then add the words "so far".  What he said subsequently was that the bailout would cost €2.5 billion, then €8 billion, then €16 billion, €24 billion and now €34 billion.  Did he add the words "so far"?  He did not.  I also heard him claim today that the cost of the bailout to Ireland is only the extra interest that we now have to pay on the banking debt.  That is nonsense.Let me spell out the full cost of the banking bailout.  It will be more than €2 billion every year in direct interest costs; sovereign interest rates at a record high and the financial markets now closed to Ireland; a banking system that is still in crisis and cannot access international funds, as a result of which small and medium businesses will remain starved of credit because banks are unable to fund themselves and therefore unable to lend; and a budget that will inflict massive pain on the Irish people as the Government again tries desperately to regain the confidence of the markets.Let us be very clear about this.  Every penny of spending cut by the Government, every penny of taxes raised above €3 billion in the next budget will be the direct result of a failed banking strategy.  The markets have lost confidence in the banking strategy of the Minister for Finance, but they have also lost confidence in his economic strategy.  Any small credibility he might have had left with the markets was destroyed last week when the Government produced its so-called "jobs strategy".  It says a lot about this Government and how out of touch with reality it is that it thinks getting a series of State agencies to issue jobs targets amounts to a jobs strategy.  They actually believe that 300,000 jobs can be created without any change in policy or without any additional money.  What nonsense.Fine Gael has produced a real jobs strategy called "New ERA"; 100,000 jobs can be created through an investment by the profitable semi-State companies and the sale of non-strategic State assets.  That is a real jobs strategy, identified by the Minister for Finance as being a discussion document of real worth and identified by a Minister of State at the Department of Finance as being a worthwhile document.  However, it will not be accepted by the Government because its tribal tendencies do not allow it to accept any quality proposal from anybody outside its own ranks.The Government's "write whatever cheques" policy for banks has destroyed confidence in our public finances.  That is why the Government has been forced out of the sovereign debt markets.  That is why the Minister for Finance now says that we may need even greater spending cuts than previously thought.  When one considers how €40 billion borrowed over the next five to ten years could have been invested to boost confidence in Ireland's long-term prospects, pouring it down the drain of two dead banks is, quite simply, an outrage on the Irish people by bad Government.  Our banking and economic crisis is one whose origin lies in catastrophic policy mistakes.  It is the legacy of the "when we have it we spend it" approach to managing the economy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, when he was Minister for Finance and of his policy of blank cheques for zombie banks over the past two years.The Fine Gael view is very simple; we can only beat this crisis and emerge from it if we have the courage to create a new future by changing our public services, restoring competitiveness and investing ambitiously in the arteries of the economy that drive recovery.  Instead, the Government is pursuing a strategy which will leave Irish society, and the people who comprise it, deeply scarred by this recession.  No matter how often the Taoiseach repeats it, writing whatever cheques are necessary to bail out delinquent banks and finding the softest targets to cut the budget deficit is not a formula for economic recovery.  It is a strategy trapped in a cramped and out of touch view of the world.  Many of its so-called "cures" are actually killing the patient.  It is not doing anything to alter our course, change the underlying dynamic or redesign the dysfunctional system that is grinding down even the best of our people.  Go into anyone's premises and talk to people in their offices and they will tell one how the State is crushing their initiative and enterprise.  Some people continue to work hard and do reasonably well despite the pressure and intervention of the State and despite the fact that they operate against a background of catastrophic economic and political Government that has been there too long.The Government strategy will not work because at its core it is about battening down the hatches and pulling up the ladder behind those who are already on the inside.  It locks out those who have yet to get a foothold on the economic ladder and there is no help or encouragement to tap in to the motivation of so many people who want to help this country and who have a part to play, who want to take on new workers, who want to increase their business and who want to get back into exports.  It is all waffle and loose talk.  There is no concentration or real focus on making a real impact in that area.It is the new generation which is being abandoned by Government, when it nurses along crippled loans from a reckless past instead of providing credit to the people who can build a successful future and when it is slashing investment at a time when the arteries for our economic success are choked for the want of improvements.  It is about Government banning new recruits from joining our public service, but doing nothing to reform the bloated structure of politics and of government, identified even in this Chamber on a constant basis.  It is about Government cutting the pay of low-paid public servants, but finding a way to exempt the 655 top earners in what was a most unfair decision.  It is about Government cutting social welfare payments, but doing nothing to reform the features of our welfare system that trap people in poverty.  What does it do for young talent who cannot get credit, who cannot get jobs, whose potential is wasted and whose spirit is crushed, their disillusionment exacerbated?  It offers them a series of closed doors and bleak prospects — a passport to another country.  That is the catastrophic misjudgment of what is necessary for economic recovery in our country.  That is what the Government does to people.  That is where the Government is wrong.  That is where the people will reward it when they get the chance, by throwing it out.In November, the Government plans to unveil a multi-year fiscal strategy in an effort to convince the markets that it really has a plan for this country that will work.  These multi-plans are in the area of banking, of fiscal policy and of growth policy.  The problem for the Taoiseach and his Government now is this.  How, in heaven's name, could the markets have any confidence in a multi-year strategy from a Government that will not survive beyond a few more months?  Is not the truth very simple here?  Neither the markets nor the people of the country, whose trust the Government has used and abused, can have any confidence in a Government that has run out of energy, ideas and credibility.  What this country needs is a clear agenda, a clear pathway to the future.  It needs a strong Government with a clear mandate from the people of Ireland.  In that context, what this country needs is a general election.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I look forward to this opportunity to speak on the statement issued by the Minister for Finance today on the banking crisis.  No doubt it is a real crisis.  As the Minister for Finance stated this morning, the figures that have been revealed are horrific and numbing in the sense of their scale and their implications for every person in this country.  There is deep regret, and rightly, deep anger, at that level of legacy from a property bubble and banking failure in this country that has cost us dear.  We must work out now how we get out of that, how we recover as a country, how we manage it and where we go on from here to get our economy working again and get people working again.It was both a liquidity crisis and a solvency crisis.  Sometimes people argue that it was one versus the other; it was both, in real depth.  The liquidity position of our banks fed into the solvency crisis.  It was that ease of access to money, coming in many instances from international banks in the European Union, pension funds and local authorities and other sources, in such large volumes into the Irish economy which created a liquidity pattern of excess access to short-term resources that ended up in helping create our solvency problem in the misguided banking model which built on that, taking those short-term liabilities and matching them with long-term assets that did not have the real value that people thought they had at the time.  This has been both a liquidity and a solvency crisis and in a sense, I would argue, it was the nature of the liquidity system we set up, the huge reliance on short-term cash deposits in our banks, that was one of the fundamental causes of the problems.In looking at the various options to solving that problem, in looking at what could have been done, I want to reflect on some of the other options that may have been available and that were correctly and honestly presented, and maybe give some reasoning that I would have as to why they were not taken, and, indeed, I believe, would not have been the right options.First, when the immediate liquidity and solvency crisis became apparent — in fairness, there were some people who saw it coming in advance and called it for what it was — to everyone in September 2008 and the unsustainability of the model became exposed, I suppose there was the "let them go" option, which was to let the whole thing crash.  However, we must take cognisance of the fact——

I am speaking extempore.On the argument that we should just let our whole banking system go, we must have regard to a number of points.  First, much of our expert advice, for example, from the likes of Professor Patrick Honohan in his report into this banking crisis, stated such an approach would have led to catastrophic social consequences — massive unemployment and significant economic destruction.  That is something one, when in Government, must take on board.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I am confident we will as a people.The other factor to take into account is that the European and other international institutions at the time had all set their direction against such a course — the experience, it would seem, from the 1930s, having scarred into people's minds in the European Central Bank and elsewhere that such an approach of letting things go merely leads to much wider social trouble, not just for the individual country but capable of spreading like a contagion.Even in the instance of Lehman Brothers, which people might cite as an example of where a bank was let go, the reality was that institution only accounted for approximately 4% of US GDP in scale, whereas some of our institutions in immediate crisis accounted for over half of our GDP in scale, according to the size of their balance sheet.  When one reads what happened in the US, rather than merely having a "let it go" policy, there were frantic efforts right up to the day before Lehman Brothers went into difficulty to try to avoid such a scenario using the approach that they had available to them in the US of merely merging banks to try to cover the difficulty.  We did not have that option available to us, unfortunately, because of the crazy liquidity situation that had developed in Irish banks.  The collective madness that had developed around property lending meant that we did not have a sufficient banking sector to pick up the pieces from any one other institution.Letting them go or letting them merge and letting the banking system manage us through this crisis was not an easy option.  It would have gone contrary to everything the European Central Bank and the European Union, and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and all of the other authorities that were advising us here at home, were saying we needed to do in the circumstances.A second approach that was considered in some real detail was following something similar to what the UK Government had introduced, an insurance premium scheme covering future losses in the banks coming from these assets and loans that were impaired or, in our case, effectively, eviscerated.  That would not have been the right approach.  There was argument at the time that it would not have worked here as it had in the UK because the UK had different circumstances.  The UK had a property development construction industry that had access to capital resources that would be able to recover and develop under such an insurance premium scheme, and we did not have that.  People were operating here from their back pocket and the money the bank gave them was put into that back pocket.Even beyond that, such an insurance approach, given the scale and damage that was done in Irish banks, would have left ongoing uncertainty that would have seen continuing contraction and retrenchment in the Irish banking system for however many years such an insurance scheme was in place.  The doubt over the scale of the losses would have been well founded and would have placed a question mark on the entire funding and financial situation in this State.  Again, while looking back after almost one and a half years, I do not believe that such an insurance model would have worked.Likewise, some argued for nationalisation.  When I got a sense of the scale of the problem we faced in late 2008, my first reaction was to nationalise all the banks because then we could at least manage the situation.  I remember bringing such a suggestion to the Minister for Finance at that time.  He did not rule it out and he considered all the options as we went through that incredibly difficult period.  Ultimately however, he counselled against it and one and a half years later one can at least see that such an approach or solution would not have been effective.  Again, there would be no certainty as to the scale of the losses or as to what was the real truth in respect of the banks.  Thankfully, banks such as Bank of Ireland, which got into the same mistaken and mad lending, albeit not to the same extent as others, now can act as a fully functioning bank.

That will be important when emerging from this situation, because as horrible and difficult as these losses are, I prefer to know what they are rather than not knowing or having them hidden within a nationalised institution or under an insurance premium taken out by the Government that would have gone on forever and a day.  It is better to have a sense of the scale of the problem, horrific as it is, than otherwise.As for the approach taken, some of the international literature on what happens in such banking crises — this is a common phenomenon — shows the capitalist system does not work well in asset markets.  Almost invariably, there is a sense that markets in goods and services are quite stable but markets in assets appear to be fundamentally unstable.  They are subject to human failings in respect of overvaluing, hyping up and then getting caught in a bubble.

It cites that model as the standard operating procedure and response one makes and that is what the Government has done.I acknowledge it has taken time.  It took time from the consideration of such an option to getting it through this House.  It took the Government a long time but it was right to legislate and to debate for that.  That is one reason for the delay that has taken place and which has caused uncertainty and recent difficulties in the markets' understanding of the extent of our problem and our ability to get out of it.  However, that was the legislative process we needed to go through.  Moreover, this was complex legislation on which people worked long and hard.  I believe it was the right type of legislation and that it will stand up to scrutiny in the courts and elsewhere.

Real lessons were learned that banks do not necessarily present information in the timely and honest fashion that was need and that it was right for the Government to take the firm action of sending in independent analysts rather than trusting the banks. If it took a long time to get that work done, that partly was because the banks were not quick or straight enough in the presentation of information.  However, from my distant review of their work, I believe the people involved from the State side in NAMA have done their work diligently, honestly and correctly.  Nevertheless, it has taken time and that has been one of the difficulties.However, one of the benefits arising from what has gone through today, as difficult a day as this is, is that we are coming to the end of this process.  We have put a timeline on it and have created some certainty in respect of figures.

This is an important part of this process to enable them to begin lending in order that the economy can start to recover.In respect of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, the banking model employed was completely and, to my mind fraudulently, wrong in the sense that one could not consider such a model rationally and think how any one could perceive it to be viable, sustainable or proper.  It is a legacy that will be scarred into our country and which has had huge consequences and effects.  As for the company law aspects, as well as considering the nature of the management systems and other actions that took place, it is up to our judicial system to investigate them.  It is frustrating for the political system to witness how long that is taking.  While I dearly wish that the judicial system could complete its work faster, the Government cannot interfere and must be removed from it.  One of the strengths of our democratic system is the independence of our legal system and this must be maintained, even in situations such as this.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Yes, I believe we all bear responsibility, obviously including in particular the Ministers who were in power at the time, as well as the regulators and board members of those banks.  I note that it was very much the great and the good, that is, the well-regarded in our society, who were in such regulatory systems, on such boards and in the political systems.  Yes, there was widespread failure to recognise the scale and damage that the bubble was going to cause.As for Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, I am glad we brought some clarity to the effect that the good bank approach was not the right one to take.  I believe it would have distracted from the more important task of getting as much value back for the Irish public from the remaining loans, as they are wound down and sold on, to minimise the damage and loss that will accrue to the Irish taxpayer.  This is the task on which the management there now must concentrate and I believe this should be done as quickly as possible with the least cost and least use of resources and the maximum possible return from the assets.In respect of AIB, which obviously was one of the main subjects of the Minister's announcement today, from the outset of this process, it always has been certain that the Government would seek to socialise the profits in any recovery from our banking system, as well at the losses.  It always was certain that the Government would try to redress the balance sheet somewhat in the public interest by taking a stake in our banks with the prospect and intention of selling such a stake into an open market as soon as is possible to be able to realise some of those profits.  This always has been the policy and there never has been an instinct within the Government to look away from that possibility, to rule it out or not to expect it as a possible or likely outcome.  The Government now must do this and must ensure that it manages an institution such as AIB with a majority stake in public ownership in a manner that allows the bank to regrow and to recover a profit for the Irish taxpayer.I said to Deputy Dempsey yesterday that the Labour Party had been postulating that we need to take money from a pension reserve fund and put it into a new bank to help recovery.  I argue that, in a sense, that is what we are doing today with AIB.  We are taking money from our pension reserve fund and putting it into the bank as capital with a view to having it lent to the Irish market.  That may be a more effective method of getting a bank lending than trying to reintroduce a new branch and lending structure across the country, which would take time and could be more costly.  I would be interested in hearing the Labour Party's response to this.  The concept we have is correct, namely, using the reserves we have to capitalise the bank and to ensure the existence of a new banking culture so we will profit from the money invested.Critically, we need a change in banking culture.  It is right that the culture is changing from the top down and that we have new boards and management.  The public lack of trust in Irish banks is serious.  Banking requires trust.  I have said for some time that we need new boards and management and that it will take time to achieve this.  We need them to restore trust in Irish banking.There are good people in Irish banking.  I do not contend the 80,000 people working in our clearing banks should not be able to advance their careers and set out on a new banking course.  I refer to those who have an eye to cash flow lending rather than property lending, with which our banks became obsessed, and to those who want to understand that banking is about personal relationships and the assessment of personal risk.  If I were a lender, it would be a case of my determining whether a person such as Deputy Noonan has the capability to turn something around and make a go of it, and has the strength of character to pay me back if he runs into difficulty.  This is the kind of banking skill people need.We need a new culture, particularly in AIB because it is one of our largest banks.  We need to get it working.

I may have to speak about it on another occasion.People have rightly asked whether we should not have taken on the senior bondholders.  My instinct is absolutely similar to that of others in the House in that I ask why the taxpayer should have to take all the hit.  If one goes to experts and officials and asks whether the bondholders should share some of the hit with the taxpayer, the point made in return is that the legal circumstances in which we must operate prevent this and we must do things by the book and according to the law.  Our legal structure is one of the strengths of our system.  It attracts foreign direct investment and keeps investment here.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As I understand it — I will be happy to hear Deputy Noonan argue another view — contracts were entered into giving the depositors the exact same rights as the bondholders.  Those rights cannot be taken away retrospectively.  A court challenge from a bondholder would contend the deposit holder has the exact same rights as a bondholder and that one could not just attack a bondholder without attacking the deposit holder.  In Anglo Irish Bank, the main deposit holder is the European Central Bank.  That is one of the realities we face.  The advice one receives pertains to the consequences of taking on the European Central Bank, which is acting as a central bank of last resort, and correctly recognises that the European banking system let us down also by allowing bad lending to the Irish market and that it also should have been on guard against and preventing this.One should recognise that if others try to target the bondholders — perhaps the Deputies opposite will have the potential to do so at some stage — they will, I am certain, receive the same advice that we have had, namely that the risk attached to such an approach, which approach would affect our ability to hold emergency and other deposits in the banking system that are needed to surmount this difficulty, would result in a higher cost for the Irish taxpayer.  Even a small increase accruing from the taking of such an action continually would lead to an interest charge for the Irish people that would be greater than the savings made.It must be recognised that the Anglo Irish Bank model, having been so fundamentally unsound and dependent on short-term deposits, was such that, of the approximately €70 billion liability on the balance sheet, only approximately €4 billion pertained to senior bonds, as opposed to the vast sums in short-term cash deposits which are now in short-term emergency cash deposits.  This is hard to explain to the Irish people and hard to talk about in public.  Over the past year or two, because there were market sensitivities, one could not talk about AIB.  It is very difficult to talk about bondholders within the guarantee period but that was the reality we were faced with.  Those were some of the options we were faced with.  Any party in government will face them.When the banking system changes — I believe it will need to change — perhaps we will see that easy options, which may give real encouragement to the public, should carry a health warning because, unfortunately, there is no easy way out of the problem.  We will make our way out of it.  We are a capable, skilled trading country.  Having a balance-of-payment surplus again will help us out of our difficulties.  I regret deeply the banking legacy we have had to manage but our broad approach was the correct one.  The alternatives would have been more expensive and less effective.

His speech was basically about policy and mine will be in the same vein.  One must look at this matter in a number of ways.  The property bubble was clearly caused by reckless lending from the banks but it was also associated with a lack of proper regulation of the banks.  If regulation is not applied consistently, certain people in business will abuse the system.With regard to the guarantee put in place, Professor Honohan stated it was too wide.  There is no other compatible guarantee worldwide with such a level of spread.  Anglo Irish Bank was clearly insolvent at the time of the guarantee.  When the guarantee was being advocated, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, stated it was for €440 billion.  He stated the assets in the banks were worth more than the liabilities and that we would not have to enforce the guarantee.  We find today that between €48 billion and €52.8 billion will be going into the banks.  This is an incredible figure.  It is up to 32% of national wealth.  This is the equivalent of our current expenditure on an annual basis.  In respect of Anglo Irish Bank alone, €30 billion will be required.  The Taoiseach said yesterday interest repayments would cost €1.5 billion per year at a rate of 5%.  When put in context, this will result in the removal of home helps and special-needs staff and will have a considerable effect on education, which is important to the Green party and others.  It has enormous implications for the ordinary person on the street.The Government is trying to present today as a normal day.  It is a momentous, black Thursday.  It is a frightening day for the public, who see that AIB, the biggest bank in the State, is being nationalised.  It is costing the taxpayer €10.4 billion.When the guarantee was introduced, it was too wide.  Professor Honohan has stated that.  Once the guarantee was introduced, the Government had a two-year opportunity to sort out the banks.

Anglo Irish Bank requires up to €34 billion, certainly €30 billion.  AIB now requires €10.4 billion.  An extra €3 billion has been put into AIB today, which is the equivalent of the minimum amount of cuts to be made in the forthcoming budget.  There is a disconnect between the Government and the public and this is having major implications.  The Government procrastinated over Anglo Irish Bank, which was clearly insolvent.  The Minister made reference to our proposal for a good bank-bad bank model.  The greatest difference under our proposal is that toxic loans would not have been valued.  NAMA, which we opposed at the outset, has had an impact in terms of the sentiment of international markets.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am aware of the suggestion made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, both in an address on 20 September last and in his comments earlier today, that reprogramming of the budgetary profile over the coming years will be necessary.  To ensure that sustainability is restored to the public finances, the Government set out in budget 2010 a multi-annual fiscal consolidation framework to reduce the general Government deficit to less than 3% of GDP by the end of 2014.Significant action has already been taken in regard both to expenditure and taxation in order to restore sustainability to the public finances.  Between July 2008 and the supplementary budget in April 2009, adjustments designed to yield approximately 5% of GDP in 2009 were introduced.  Budget 2010 delivered a further adjustment, mainly on the expenditure side, of €4 billion or 2.5% of GDP.  Therefore, the cumulative correction to date has been 7.5% of GDP.The most recent Exchequer returns covering the period to the end of August show that the Government's actions are having a positive effect, with the overall Exchequer position broadly in line with expectations.  The target of raising €20 billion from the bond markets in 2010 has now been achieved and, taking account of the funding already completed this year, cash balances, retail debt and longer-term funding carried over from last year, Ireland is funded through to the middle of next year.I stress once again that the Government remains fully committed to meeting the target of having a deficit below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014.  As I said in my statement on banking this morning, it is important that we have a credible path to show how we propose to meet this commitment.  Work is under way on a four-year budgetary plan that will set out the annual measures required to restore order to the public finances and bring our deficit below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014.I expect the Governor of the Central Bank will shortly forward to me his usual pre-budget outlook, and this, along with the most up-to-date economic and fiscal data, will be taken into account in the Government's deliberations in the run-up to the publication of the new four-year budgetary plan in early November.

His adjustment target of €3 billion is well known and he seems to have already achieved €1 billion of that through cuts in capital expenditure.

My Department will continue to assess the most up-to-date economic and fiscal data and their implications for the fiscal consolidation process in the coming years as we prepare the four-year plan.  An adjustment above €3 billion will be required next year, but it would be premature for me to go into the details about the extent of the additional consolidation required.  But additional consolidation will be required.The Exchequer returns for late September are outstanding and there are other data that tend to be assembled on a quarterly basis which are also of value to my Department.  The Department needs to assess all this information before the Government is in a position to put precise figures on the sum required in budget 2010.

Is the Minister saying he does not know what the targets are but that his Department is working on the profiles?  If that is the answer, perhaps he will tell us the level of detail Brussels expects on the profiles.  Will it accept global figures or will each expenditure cut have to be underpinned by a policy decision?  Will the tax increases have to be nominated with an indication of annual yield?

Brussels has not required anything in terms of this process.  It is a decision of the Government to introduce a four-year plan.  I certainly discussed the matter with the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Rehn, in general terms, but no specific requirements were imposed on Ireland by Brussels and there is no suggestion of that.  It was obvious to the Department and to me as Minister that the data in September were mixed and that there were risks on the downside which required to be addressed.  Indeed the Governor of the Central Bank indicated some time ago that reprogramming was necessary and I discussed the matter with him as well.I cannot speak for the Governor, but there are clearly imbalances in the public finances which require to be addressed and which are outside the difficulties faced by our banking sector.  There is a significant and unsustainable gap between the State's revenue and expenditure and downside risks in relation to growth.  Consequently, tax projections for 2011 were part of the downside risk identified at my Department.  For that reason work is under way in the Department in assessing these risks and devising sustainable forecasts for next year.  I am not going to prejudge the eventual figure, which the Government will have to arrive at, at this stage.  In regard to the €3 billion figure, it is the indicative figure agreed with the Commission and stated in the Stability and Growth Pact, but events have superseded that figure.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	468	First, I assure the Deputy that my attention is, of course, drawn to all of the important economic and fiscal data as they become available.  The quarterly national accounts figures published by the Central Statistics Office last week show that GDP declined by 1.2% between the first and second quarters of this year.  This figure must be seen in context, however, as it follows an increase of 2.2% in the first quarter.  In other words, taken together, the figures for the first two quarters suggest that GDP has stabilised.  The quarterly figure for GNP was a decline of 0.3% between the first and second quarters, pointing towards stabilisation in this measure of economic activity.  In annual terms, GDP fell by 1.8% in the second quarter.Personal consumption and investment moved in line with expectations while exports continued to perform well.  However, a somewhat unexpected surge in imports reduced the overall level of GDP in the second quarter.  The improvement in our export performance evident in the quarterly figures is encouraging, as is the fact that the export base has broadened in recent quarters.  This suggests the significant improvements in competitiveness in recent years are having the desired effect.The more recent economic indicators paint a somewhat mixed picture.  On the domestic front retail sales have weakened over the summer months.  On the external front the indications are that exports continue to perform well, which is to be welcomed.  The most recent Exchequer returns show that in the first eight months of the year, €18.9 billion in tax revenue was collected.  While this was almost €1.9 billion below what was collected in the same period in 2009, it was in line with what my Department had expected.  In fact, tax revenues to the end of August were just 0.7% below target.In terms of the labour market, employment fell sharply over the course of last year and this is reflected in the annual decline in the second quarter of this year.  Shorter-term indicators point towards stabilisation.  For instance, the seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter decline in employment in the second quarter was 0.4%.  While we all regret any loss in employment, it is important to note this was the lowest rate of employment loss in more than two years.  The unemployment rate picked up over the summer.  However, much of this was due to seasonal factors, and this was confirmed yesterday with the publication of the September live register figures showing a very substantial reduction in the number on the live register as well as a seasonally adjusted reduction.In terms of the short-term evolution of the economy, there is much uncertainty at the moment.  Recovery over the next year or so will probably be gradual.  As I have indicated, my Department is currently assessing all relevant information and will publish revised macro-economic forecasts in the coming weeks.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I thank the Minister for his reply.  At the time of the 2010 budget last December, the Minister famously said that the economy had turned a corner.  However, the reality is that the domestic economy remains in recession having contracted for nine straight quarters.  Does the Minister agree with Professor John McHale, professor of economics, National University of Ireland, Galway, that the cause of recession in Ireland is a lack of domestic demand.  Looking at our situation negatively, almost 14% of our people are out of work.  However, looking at it positively, 86% of our people are in work but are, by and large, terrified to spend.  Does the Minister accept that returning the Irish economy to growth is fundamental to reducing the rate of interest Ireland must pay for borrowing, putting a floor under the property market and, fixing the banks?  Does the Minister accept that they are strategically the three things any Government will have to do to get Ireland out of recession?

That is a substantial amelioration in our position.  In 2009 and the latter stages of 2008, we had a serious contraction in GNP.  This year, we have seen a stabilisation, which is a turning of a corner.I am pleasantly surprised to discover that I agree with the remainder of the Deputy's question.  I believe a growth strategy is essential to stabilise the property market——

Was this budgetary plan requested by the European Commission?  Has it been agreed with the European Commission and who will prepare the plan?  Everybody agrees that the growth forecast previously used by the Minister erred on the side of optimism.  Will the four-year plan be drawn up independently, as suggested by some people?Will the Minister provide, as was done in the United Kingdom prior to the general election for George Osborne and Vincent Cable, a direct line of information to me, as Labour Party spokesperson on finance and other finance spokespersons, from the Department of Finance and whoever else is drawing up the plan?

My Department did not err on the side of optimism in its growth forecast for this year.  In fact, the first quarter GDP out-performed the departmental forecast.  On the question of who decided there should be a four-year plan, the Government, on my recommendation as Minister for Finance, decided we should have a four-year plan.  There is no question of the authorities in Brussels dictating or suggesting to Ireland it should have a four-year plan.

Naturally, there were intensive discussions between the Commission and myself prior to this morning's important announcement.  I made clear at that stage that we are embarked on such a course, following a Government decision.  There was no request from Europe for such a plan although Europe is happy to endorse it, as has been made clear by the euro-group.  I participated in the euro-group meeting this morning by telephonic contact.The following is an important point.  The reason we need a four-year plan is not because anyone in Brussels believes we need it but because the crucial element in the stability and growth pact is meeting the 3% target by 2014.  To do this, and to demonstrate this can be done, a credible pathway must be shown.  I accept we have made substantial progress.  I mentioned that we have already executed a 7.5% correction in GDP terms.  Clearly, meeting a quantitative target in a given year is not sufficient to establish the credibility of the plan.

The credibility of that trackway requires a detailed programme of decisions over a number of years.  On the request made by Deputy Burton, on her own behalf and that of the Fine Gael party, for information in the period approaching a general election, I will consider that but I am not aware there is a general election pending.  I appreciate the request and will raise with my Department the possibility of meeting it during an election period.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	480	On 8 September last, I announced the Government's decision on the restructuring and resolution of Anglo Irish Bank, which remains subject to European Commission approval.This envisages the splitting of the bank into two licensed and regulated credit institutions: an asset recovery bank focussed on recovering maximum value for the State from the loan assets and business of Anglo not being transferred to NAMA and a funding bank to fully safeguard Anglo's deposit base.  It is important to note that this restructuring is not a cessation of business.As I indicated in my statement, the Central Bank has completed its assessment of the capital required by the new structure.  A statement has been issued by the Central Bank detailing the capital required in a base case and in a stressed scenario and providing an explanation of the approach and methodology adopted to determine the bank's capital requirements.The Central Bank has determined and advised the bank that in the central, or expected loss case, an additional €6.4 billion in total capital will be needed for the recovery bank and funding bank structure to continue to meet the minimum capital requirements in the coming years consistent with Basel rules.  A total of €22.9 billion has already been provided by the State since the bank was nationalised early in 2009.  This additional capital requirement brings the projected total gross cost of the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank to €29.3 billion.  This additional capital will be provided by increasing the Promissory Note issued by the State and by appropriate burden-sharing exclusively by holders of Anglo subordinated debt instruments, as outlined in my statement.The Central Bank has also undertaken a stress test on Anglo building on the PCAR analysis carried out for the other banks earlier in the year by the Financial Regulator.  It has determined that on the basis of severe stress assumptions, including a 70% discount on the remainder of Anglo's NAMA loans, the stress case level of losses in Anglo Irish Bank could potentially be €5 billion higher than in the expected case of €29.3 billion.  The stress case indicates the upper boundary of the level of losses.  It does not represent the Central Bank's expectation of the likely outcome.  The Government will, therefore, capitalise the new structure to the expected case requirement of €29.3 billion.It will be a priority for authorities to press ahead with the restructuring of the bank with a view to achieving its split early in 2011.  I will continue to be in close consultation with the European Commission and, in particular with Commissioner Almunia, with the aim of providing in the next month all elements necessary to bring the Commission's assessment of the restructuring plan to a positive conclusion.  This should allow the matter to be settled through a formal Commission decision on a timely basis.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Why does the Minister consider it necessary to make transfers from the recovery bank to NAMA given the sole work of the recovery bank will be to work out the impaired assets?  With the lifting of the ceiling from €5 million to €20 million this appears like the organisation of a big NAMA and a small NAMA, with assets being transferred from one to the other?  This seems superfluous and is also a pretty costly exercise.  If the impaired assets remain in the recovery bank the people who are expert in this area can work out and recover value on the assets.  The transfer process involves bringing in a lot of professional people, who, as we know from the NAMA business plan which allocates €2.5 billion for professional fees over five years, charge large fees.  Is that not superfluous, especially given the changes the Minister announced this morning?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I do not agree it is superfluous.  The Deputy's question is why the National Asset Management Agency loans are not simply left in the recovery bank.  The whole purpose of NAMA is to deal on a systematic, national, cross-bank basis with all of the toxic loans and all the loans in the land and development sector.  This was essential because of the cross-collateralisation of exposures throughout the banking system.  As was made clear during the debate on NAMA, the exposure by particular developers across a range of banks made it essential that we establish an agency that would deal with those exposures on a systematic basis.  There were a large number of individuals who had such cross-systemic exposures that required to be dealt with in a structured way.One question which the Deputy did not pose but which follows on from his question was whether we considered putting the rest of the Anglo Irish Bank loan book into NAMA — doing it the other way around, if one likes.  The answer is that NAMA is busy enough with the amount of work in hand.  The remainder of the non-NAMA book in the bank is not concentrated on land and development matters but constitutes general business lending.  It is a matter of public record that there is only one very substantial customer of the systemic type, of which a number transferred with the NAMA book.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	483	When the Minister decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency, the Government's policy was to rescue Anglo Irish Bank to enable it to continue actively trading.  Since then, the Government has changed its view on Anglo Irish Bank and has effectively organised it into two parts for a wind-down.  The cost and work involved in transferring the toxic assets from the recovery bank component of Anglo Irish Bank to the National Asset Management Agency make such a transfer superfluous and costly.  It has the second disadvantage of crystallising the debt before it is necessary to do so.I do not see the logic of this exercise.  While the cheerleaders in the professions will be delighted with it, the taxpayer does not come out of it very well.  I cannot see the advantage of going through the whole rigmarole of making transfers to NAMA from what is now a recovery bank with similar functions to NAMA.  Circumstances have changed and Government policy on Anglo Irish Bank has changed completely.

That premise was that the purpose of the National Asset Management Agency was to rescue Anglo Irish Bank to enable it to be a functioning or good bank, if one likes.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Let us be clear about this.  When Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised early in 2009, it did not thereafter substantially expand its existing loan book.  The question of whether the bank was being downsized did not arise.  From the moment of nationalisation, the policy in relation to Anglo Irish Bank has been to downsize it.  The idea that somehow I entertained the notion that it could be transformed into a good bank through transferring assets to NAMA is erroneous.  That was the premise of the Deputy's question.As I have made clear at all stages, management made a case for a split of the bank between a good and bad bank.  At times, some Deputies in the Fine Gael Party made a similar case regarding the resolution of the Anglo Irish Bank problem.  This was a case that I had examined and it was evaluated by my Department.  It was eventually dealt with by Department on the second management application and on the submission of the second application to Brussels.On the Deputy's point about crystallising the debts, the difficulty is that the Irish banking crisis is clearly related to the fall in asset price values from the peak of the property market in late 2006 and early 2007.  The only credible way to deal with a banking crisis of that type and the textbook approach to doing so is to guarantee the liabilities, set up an asset management company and capitalise the institutions concerned.  Those are the steps we have taken and completed this morning.  The idea that one cannot crystallise the debt and leave these loans lingering on bank balance sheets would lead to a collection of zombie banks which would fail to reform, improve and repair themselves over a long number of years.

As a consequence, the public service payroll will be more than 8% less in 2010 compared to 2009 and nearly 12% less than in 2008.  These measures include the non-payment of proposed general round increases under the review and transitional agreement, the application of a pension-related deduction of an average of nearly 7% to the earnings of all public servants and, at the beginning of this year, a reduction in the rates of pay and allowances for public servants was implemented under the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.In addition to these measures, the introduction of a general moratorium on recruitment and promotion together with incentivised early retirement and career break schemes and natural turnover of public servants who retire or leave has led to a reduction in the number of public servants employed by almost 11,000 since March 2009.  Government policy on staff numbers in the public service is reflected in employment control frameworks for each sector of the public service.  The continued application of the frameworks across the public service will result in a further reduction in public service employee numbers up to 2012.The agreement provides that, where circumstances warrant it, the Government may offer voluntary mechanisms to exit the public service, either generally or targeted towards specific sectors or bodies.  However, having regard to the reduction in numbers I have already noted and the continued application of the employment control frameworks, the Government has no plans to introduce further schemes.  The effective implementation of the agreement and the efficiencies and other measures which will arise from that will provide a sustainable framework to manage the provision and delivery of our essential public services despite the reductions in public service numbers and in a period of unprecedented pressure on resources.

What are the projections for reductions in staff from 2009 until 2015 under the Croke Park agreement?  Will the Minister provide annualised figures?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The reduction of 11,000 has been achieved since March 2009.  I will undertake to provide the Deputy with the information he seeks as I do not have information on projected reductions in numbers to hand.  Clearly, that projection could be influenced by budgetary decisions taken by the Government.

Will the Minister remind me of the terms of this provision?  Are we approaching press-the-button time, so to speak?

There are no proposals before my Department at present to activate it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I have said previously that Ireland as a country has been let down badly by certain individuals who held senior appointments — both at executive and director level — at some of our covered institutions.  Their actions and inaction have and will continue to have severe ramifications for the citizens of this country.  Deputy Noonan will appreciate that it would be wrong of me to comment on cases which are subject to ongoing investigation by the relevant statutory authorities.One of the first actions the Government took in this area was the appointment of two public interest directors to all of the major covered institutions.  These appointments were persons whom I am sure the Deputy would concur are of high calibre and have undertaken their roles very seriously.Contrary to public perception, many changes at director and senior executive levels at the covered institutions have taken place.  It has to be accepted that a complete turnover of all of the respective appointments at the covered institutions was neither practical nor desirable in one instant.  What the Government has sought to do is to bring certainty to the operation of the Irish financial system by making progressive changes.Since September 2008, the chairpersons and chief executives of all of the covered institutions bar one have changed.  In other words, of the six principal covered institutions, five chairpersons and five of the chief executives have changed since 2008.  There has also been a substantial turnover of non-executive directors over this period.  In total, based on information supplied to me by the covered institutions, 43 directors have vacated their positions for a variety of reasons since September 2008 with 30 new appointments being made.  In addition, some 31 senior executives have departed.  The House will also be aware that arising from the actions I announced this morning further changes at board and management level will follow at Allied Irish Bank.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the need for people filling directorship roles to be well qualified, with appropriate skills and experience, in order to lead the institutions through the major changes that are taking place in banking.Additional material not given on the floor of the House.A mix of board members from the domestic market and outside Ireland is also a desirable objective.  Since the introduction of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme in September 2008, the Central Bank and Financial Regulator have reviewed the procedures under which applicants for senior roles in credit institutions have been considered.  A range of measures have been adopted, or are in process, as part of a wider strategy to update the domestic regulatory framework applying to banks and insurers and as part of these measures a consultation paper on corporate governance standards has been issued.  The new Central Bank Reform Act will also introduce a new range of powers available to the Central Bank in relation to the appointment of individuals to control functions and pre-approved control functions, which will include directors. An interview process, as part of the fitness and probity procedure, has been initiated for proposed senior roles in credit institutions.I have said previously that it is not only a change of personnel that is required but a change of culture.  The public interest aspect of decisions taken at board level of these institutions has to have a much greater prominence.  The pursuit of selfish profit motives, without appropriate regard for risk, has to be challenged both within the banks and by the appropriate authorities.  Decisions undertaken by management have to be severely and robustly challenged by board members which as we have learnt to our cost did not happen to the necessary extent in the past.The Deputy will also be aware that the appointment by the Government of both the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator changed previous practices in this area.  In this connection, I might also mention that I undertook a public expression of interest procedure in connection with the appointment of board members of NAMA which resulted in three of the final appointees emerging from this process.

Government policy is that persons of the highest competence and expertise should be appointed to senior management positions.  It is a matter, in the first instance, for the board.One matter which we should discuss on an all-party basis, given the degree of State control that now exists in the banking sector, is how appointments are made to directorships in these institutions.

I understand there was some discussion this morning about allowing flexibility on this question for some probing of the matter.  I propose, with the agreement of the House, to apply that flexibility.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The Deputy will be aware that a statutory instrument which extends the eligible liabilities guarantee (ELG) scheme to 31 December 2010 was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday, having previously received EU state aid approval. The following liabilities are classified as eligible liabilities for the purposes of the ELG scheme: deposits; certificates of deposit; commercial paper; senior unsecured bonds and notes and; other senior debt specified by the Minister for Finance in accordance with EU state aid rules which are incurred in the issuance period, which runs from the date the financial institution received approval to join the scheme to 31 December 2010.  The guarantee can be applied to stand-alone debt securities or to securities issued under programmes.Term deposits with a term of five years or less which are made after the institution joined the scheme and before midnight on 31 December 2010 will be guaranteed for their term.  The maximum maturity of any eligible liabilities guaranteed is five years.My Department and the relevant state authorities along with the EU Commission will continue to monitor market developments over the coming months so as to confirm that the guarantee continues to underpin the core principles of financial stability and funding access for the financial institutions.  Progress in relation to the phasing out of the guarantee will be achieved over time consistent with any requirement for continued support of the funding conditions of the banks and the maintenance of financial stability overall.  As at end August, €730 million in respect of the CIFS scheme and €295 million in respect of the ELG scheme has been collected in fees from the institutions.The Deputy may also wish to note that the pricing of the guarantee has increased for new liabilities issued after 1 July in line with the pricing structure outlined in the European Commission's latest guidance on state aid rules for Government guarantee schemes covering bank debt.  The additional pricing will range between 20 and 40 basis points depending on the rating of the institution concerned.  In addition, the approval granted by the European Commission on 21 September 2010 in respect of short-term liabilities and deposits under the ELG scheme places an additional fee of between 20 and 70 basis points on such short term guaranteed funds issued up to 31 December 2010.The exact level of the charges accruing to the State will be dependent on the level of issuance by the participating institution.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Could the Minister state the total value of various financial instruments that were covered by the CIFS scheme but which are no longer covered by the scheme invoked by statutory instrument yesterday?  Could he give an indication of the spread across the different paper?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I can give the Deputy figures for the total covered liabilities for each scheme, which may be of assistance to him.  The total covered liabilities under the original CIFS scheme were €103 billion, of which retail and corporate deposits were €31 billion.  The total covered liabilities on the ELG scheme are €153 billion, of which retail and corporate deposits are €121 billion.  However, the information Deputy Noonan is seeking to elicit is the liabilities guaranteed under the original scheme which are no longer guaranteed now that the scheme has expired.  Asset covered securities and dated subordinated debt are not eligible liabilities under the terms of the new scheme and are no longer guaranteed, as of today.  Also, any term deposits taken or debt issued before the participating institution joined the scheme in the beginning of 2010 and which has an expiry date that falls after the 29 September 2010 is no longer guaranteed after 29 September.  Undated subordinated debt was never guaranteed.The amount of dated subordinated debt and senior debt issued before September 2008 and which will remain on the books of the six covered institutions is as follows: subordinated debt €5.3 billion; and senior debt €25.88 billion.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	508	We were given a short briefing in the Department of Finance yesterday morning.  The Minister's officials said that something like €36 billion was coming off the guarantee at midnight last night in relation to senior debt.  The Minister made various statements earlier today suggesting that he had legal advice of some kind — the Attorney General, I think, was quoted — that it was not possible to negotiate with the senior bondholders.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I never said that.

The figures we were advised of by the Minister's officials at the briefing yesterday were somewhat higher than the €26 billion he has just mentioned.  Why is there any real impediment to negotiating with bondholders who have come off guarantee?  What impediment can there possibly be to that?  When businesses fail and go into receivership, creditors, which is what bondholders are, make schemes of arrangement and sacrifices because they hope to do business again in the future.  Why have we turned our face against that in respect of what——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I am somewhat alarmed that the Deputy has introduced the figure of €36 billion to the discussion.  That amount relates to senior debt in all of the covered institutions — including Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and not just those which are distressed, such as Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I know that.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	516	No.  I want the Minister to explain his thinking.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	518	This is a fundamental issue.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	519	That much is clear.  The Deputy should allow the Minister to reply.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I am trying to assist the Deputy who, I take it, is referring to senior bondholders in distressed institutions such as Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide where the total amount is substantially less than the figure to which the Deputy refers.I do not act on the basis of my own legal views, I act on the advice of the Attorney General who is the legal adviser to the Government.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	521	What is the nature of that advice?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The Attorney General provided advice with regard to legislative arrangements in respect of the treatment of bondholders in resolution law.  His advice is that in the context of such resolution regimes, it is possible — in appropriately drawn circumstances — to give priority to the investment of taxpayers over subordinated debt in a distressed institution.  In the case of senior bondholders, however, it is not possible to give such a priority because, in our legal tradition and that of the United Kingdom, the holders of these instruments rank equally with deposit holders.  In other words, they rank as general creditors.  I do not want to use the Latin word lawyers always use in this context.  I prefer to say that they rank equally or rateably with each other.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Pari passu.

That is the position.The relevant EU directive on the reorganisation of financial institutions makes clear that in reorganising such institutions one cannot differentiate or create an inequality between creditors.  There are serious European and constitutional obstacles in the context of using legislation to effect that purpose.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	525	A number of Deputies are offering and I want to allow them to contribute.  I call Deputy Morgan.

Of course it is open to any financial institution to negotiate.  I was not suggesting anything different.  We must be careful with regard to how we use the word "negotiation".  When Lehman Brothers collapsed, bondholders were invited to take part in negotiations.  It is possible for senior bondholders to enter into discussions or negotiations with financial institutions in order to ascertain whether they wish to restructure their debt.  However, I am anxious to avoid any suggestion that the Government and I are proposing that there be coercion in respect of the holders of such instruments.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	527	That is quite a change.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Is the Minister aware that the terms of certain securities allow for the possibility of non-repayment in the event of a bank becoming insolvent?  The Minister is nodding.  In such circumstances, will he state whether the Attorney General addressed that issue in specific terms and whether he indicated that the relevant provision exists?  I share Deputy Burton's view that it would be brilliant if the Minister shared the Attorney General's advice with us.Reference is made to capitalism.  I was involved in capitalism before I entered these Houses.  I bought products, processed them and then sold them on.  I was often caught out in respect of bad debts and neither the Minister nor his predecessors were there to support me.  I was obliged to pick myself up and carry on.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Will the Deputy put a question to the Minister?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I operated a one-man business for a substantial period of my existence so I am familiar with the factors to which the Deputy refers.  Subordinated debt clearly ranks behind that relating to other creditors in an insolvency.  That has always been recognised.  The terms of these instruments often define their precise priority in the event of insolvency.  That is the whole point.  The Attorney General's advice is grounded in a recognition of that.Apart altogether from the legal considerations, there are also policy considerations that come into play in respect of why the State should not and cannot countenance any suggestion of coercion or default with regard to senior debt.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I am not suggesting that anyone be coerced.

First, in the context of the current guarantee scheme, which, as a result of the House's decision last evening, provides for a comprehensive guarantee for all deposits, I accept that the end date of 31 December is awkward.  That view is shared by the Commission.  However, we must monitor market developments.  It is clearly important for the State that we establish an exit route from the guarantee system.  Even if the exit has to begin at a very high level, we must demonstrate that we have embarked on our pathway of exit from the guarantee system.  On the Deputy's question regarding discussions between bondholders in any particular institution and the management of that institution, such discussions can take place with a view to the mutual advantage of both parties.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Should we make plans for New Year's Eve or should we hold off on doing so in case our presence is required in the House?  Is the Minister in a position to outline the net loss or cost relating to the various bank guarantees?  I accept that there are charges involved but there have been losses and gains.  What is the net figure?  What is the Department's estimate for the overall annual cost to the taxpayer of the various bank bailouts, including NAMA?  How must extra per year are we going to be obliged to pay out?  I accept that the cost with regard to opportunity is massive but I wish to concentrate on the direct costs involved.  I am sure the Minister is in possession of some figures in this regard.  I am of the view that some profits will accrue but in the main there will only be major losses.Does the Minister stand over the statement that NAMA will wash its own face and make a profit?  He indicated that today's events will bring closure in respect of the process of determining the level of State support required.  That is not really the case.  I imagine the markets are going to be monitoring matters to discover what will be the end result with regard to NAMA.  The position in respect of Anglo Irish Bank has still not been really resolved.  We have been informed that the cost is €29 billion with the possibility that a few billion more might be required.  In his speech in the debate earlier today, the Minister said he wanted us to "have for the future a banking system that is firmly focused on meeting the needs of the real economy, sustainable employment creation and the savings, investment and credit needs of ordinary individuals, households and businesses".  What does he mean by the future?  When will that banking process provide credit to businesses?  When the head of the Credit Review Office appeared before a committee last week, he agreed with me that even at this stage we should be considering a State recovery bank to get money to small businesses.

On the night the legislation was introduced in the House Deputy Burton asked about the question of capital.  I replied to her by saying that it was in the first instance a matter for the institutions themselves to capitalise them and that we would go in deep to ascertain what the problems were.  We have seen what the problems were.I will not have a chance to answer Deputy English's next question on capital cost.  It is easy to answer institution by institution.  Clearly the State has received €500 million for its investment in preference shares in Bank of Ireland already and also has a substantial shareholding in the institution.  In AIB, the payment on foot of the preference shares was suspended and the State will have a substantial equity investment in the bank in the future.  The costs for Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society have been mentioned in public discussion today.

On a cash basis, a return of capital to the Exchequer at the conclusion of the period of the existence of the institution and the heavy discounting of the subordinated debt should, if anything, reduce that figure further.  It is difficult to put a figure on that.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Some €45 billion to €50 billion.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The figure for the Irish Nationwide Building Society was put this morning.  I appeal to Deputies to be careful on this subject for the following reason.  I say this in an entirely non-partisan way.  One of the defects in the Standard & Poor's evaluation was a complete refusal to acknowledge the existence of a national reserve in the form of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Given that such an institution is almost unique in European countries, it was not acknowledged in the rating assessment.  Hence if figures are beamed abroad that the total cost of the bank investment made by the State is, for example, the €50 billion Deputy Burton mentioned, in the international assessment no account is taken of the fact that part of it was not funded from borrowed money but was funded from existing State resources.  We know the policy in that regard, established by legislation, that only companies listed on the stock exchange can be invested in.  The account is capital investment for GGB purposes and does not go onto the general Government balance.  Clearly the National Pensions Reserve Fund could not be used in the context of Anglo Irish Bank or the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  I make that point because some international reports naturally and properly try to estimate the total cost but do not take into account that fact.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 23 together.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and Forfás have carried out a detailed examination of loan guarantee schemes and my Department has engaged with them.  There are a number of difficulties with the design of a loan guarantee scheme including, how it fits in with the other Government initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises, how to ensure that the loans covered would be additional to lending which would otherwise take place in any event and the additional costs and exposures to financial institutions of such a scheme.  The Credit Review Office has been set up to ensure that the banks are not refusing credit to viable businesses and it would not make sense to guarantee loans to unviable businesses.  I believe Deputy O'Donnell suggested during the NAMA debate that we should have some form of direction regarding banks and lending, and that was the genesis of the Credit Review Office idea.  In addition, the SME lending plans of AIB and Bank of Ireland mean that credit should be available as required by small and medium-sized enterprises.  Officials from both Departments will work with John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office on options to enhance support for small and medium-sized enterprises.  There is no provision in the this year's budget for such a scheme and the 2011 budget, as we know, will be announced in December.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	596	We are trying to give people signs of hope that we can reflate the economy and get some activity going.  I have been putting this proposal to the Minister for the past 18 months.  There are successful SME loan guarantee schemes working, for example, in the UK, Japan and Hong Kong.  As I have mentioned before, I envisage a co-guarantee risk-sharing scheme where the banks make the lending decision, consistent with the Credit Review Office, but the Government steps in to guarantee 50% to 75% of the loan.  This means that the bank's exposure is somewhat less.  It is a loan guarantee scheme on which, as with the one the Minister discussed earlier, fees are payable.  If the Minister believes the banks are lending in any meaningful way to small and medium-sized businesses at the moment, he is not living in the same economy and talking to the same business businesspeople as I am.  The work of Mr. Trethowan's group confirms that.The Minister told us he was preparing a four-year budget plan to be published in November.  This is a standard way to kick start loan capacity for small and medium-sized businesses.  It is one of approximately ten different plans the Labour Party has proposed.  Will the Minister give it favourable consideration?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I will certainly give it consideration and draw it to the attention of the Credit Reviewer, who is engaged in discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on this matter.  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland submitted lending plans, outlining how they would lend not less than €3 billion per year in new or increased credit facilities both this year and next year.  These plans were reviewed by Mr. Trethowan and my Department and were found to be credible.  We receive monthly progress reports from the two banks which allow us to ensure they deliver on the strong commitments given in the plans to support viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.  Mr. Trethowan has reported to the Department that both AIB and Bank of Ireland are open for business and that borrowers should use the Credit Review Office if they find this is not the case.The Credit Review Office started operations in April.  The business model is designed to determine whether declined borrowers can demonstrate that their business or farm is viable as a going concern and has cash-generation capability to service the requested credit.  An ancillary benefit of the office's establishment has been the setting up of a defined internal appeals system in the NAMA-participating banks.  A significant number of refusals are now being overturned.  Significant interest has been shown in the office in terms of inquiries, both on the web and by telephone, but this has not been translated into requests for reviews of loan applications where there is a relatively small number.  I accept some customers may feel inhibited about making an appeal against an institution.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	598	Does the Minister agree that AIB and Bank of Ireland appear to be more concerned with rebuilding their balance sheets than providing credit to the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector?  We hear of countless businesses having their overdraft and working capital facilities reduced.  There is an old saying in business, "Cash is king".  A profitable business without cash flow will easily go to the wall.  A partial loan guarantee scheme will give confidence in business lending.  Fine Gael's original proposal of a national recovery bank was based on the fact that the commercial banks had become risk averse.  Prior to this, business lending was also very much based on security being provided by property.  Does the Minister agree there is a need for a scheme to get credit flowing to the SME sector?  NAMA and bank recapitalisations to date have not succeeded in getting credit flowing again.  Does the Minister agree there is a need for a partial loan guarantee scheme and a national recovery bank?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I have heard anecdotally that there is some evidence of a difference between AIB and Bank of Ireland in their treatment of business customers.  This morning's announcement will help enormously in that regard because it will bring capital certainty to AIB's position.  The Government decided the investment in Allied Irish Banks would take the form of cash rather than relying on the accounting device of converting preference shares into ordinary shares.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	600	What was the logic behind that decision?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	601	It was to put the bank back into funds.  This comes back to Deputy O'Donnell's point about a national recovery bank.  Cash is king and generates the capacity for a bank to lend.  Setting up a new bank would mean it would take an extended period to create a realistic presence in the Irish market.  That is why the policy of turning around Bank of Ireland, which successfully raised funds on the market on a risk capital basis earlier this year, and Allied Irish Banks, which will be fully capitalised and have market certainty as a result, will enable these two institutions to progress.  I am open to examining Deputy Burton's proposal in a constructive way.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Another point made at the committee in question was that providing professional business advice can also help businesses access credit.  As many businesses find it difficult to produce, say, cashflow statements for future years, they need greater assistance from management accountants to prepare business plans before seeking loans from the banks.  The State could have a role in providing such assistance, similar to the business health check scheme in the UK.  Will the Minister, when in discussion with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, see if such a scheme could be introduced in the budget through tax breaks or a voucher scheme?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	603	That has been the experience of the Credit Review Office.  In some of its appeal cases, it had to assist in the preparation of such documentation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	604	Does the Minister appreciate that businesses need to get their customers to pay them more promptly to generate more business?  The problem is the cash cycle is frozen.  The purpose of the Labour Party's proposal for an SME loan guarantee scheme is to get the cash cycle flowing again.  The work done by Mr. John Trethowan is fine but Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland will still want to conserve capital to get away from State ownership and dependence as quickly as possible.  To achieve this, their credit lines to the SME sector will remain frozen, meaning overdraft and credit facilities will still be curtailed.  I spoke to a person last week who was offered an overdraft——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	605	Could the Deputy be brief?

There are different approaches to this problem, such as the loan guarantee schemes as proposed by Deputy Burton.  Another approach is factoring guarantees.  I will draw all these proposals to the Government's attention.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 made the necessary legislative changes to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to enable the fund to be used for the purposes of bank recapitalisation.  It empowered the Minister for Finance to direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest in listed credit institutions or to underwrite share issues by these institutions where, having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the Minister decides such a direction is required, in the public interest, to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the State or to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and ensure the continued stability of that system.On 30 March 2009, I directed the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Bank of Ireland and on 12 May 2009 I directed it to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Allied Irish Banks plc.  On 25 April 2010, I directed it to convert part of its €3.5 billion holding of Bank of Ireland preference stock into ordinary stock as part of the capital raising exercise announced by the bank on 26 April.In my statement on banking issued this morning, I announced, in order to afford every opportunity to AIB to raise as much as possible of its new capital requirement of €7.9 billion from the markets and to minimise further Government support, that it has been decided the bank's capital requirement will be met through placing an open offer to shareholders of AIB shares to the value of €5.4 billion.  This transaction will be fully underwritten by the National Pensions Reserve Fund.The use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to recapitalise our main financial institutions on commercial terms is the most appropriate and prudent use of the fund to assist in meeting the financial challenges we are facing.  With regard to the sovereign funding position, the NTMA has maintained cash balances of some €20 billion and the Exchequer is fully funded through the first half of 2011.I have not instructed the NTMA to prepare an exit strategy for the National Pensions Reserve Fund or to have the fund liquidated at short notice to ease sovereign funding concerns.  Neither has the NTMA drawn such a strategy to my attention.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Earlier, the Minister was complaining that the National Pensions Reserve Fund was not being taken into the calculations of our overall liabilities by the bond markets.  Yesterday, the Minister appointed Professor John FitzGerald of the ESRI to the new Central Bank commission.  In an article by Eamon Quinn in the  Sunday Tribune on 19 September 2010 he was quoted as saying, “Announcing the sale of the unencumbered €14 billion worth of stock market investments inside the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be a key card for the government to play.”  Ciarán O’Hagan of Societé Generale in Paris, a well known commentator on Irish Government bonds, said selling the pension fund would “be a very good surprise” for the bond markets, even though the Government had enough cash to see out the market crisis.  Given that yesterday the Minister announced the appointment of Professor Fitzgerald to the Central Bank Commission, he must have been aware, and no doubt his officials briefed him, on this prominent statement by him on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.The Labour Party put forward a proposal to use €2 billion for a strategic investment bank to kick-start and continue capital and other critical investment.  Has the Minister had a chance to examine that?

My officials did not draw his opinion to my attention either and the Central Bank Commission has no function in the operation of the NTMA.  It is important that those we appoint to bodies have opinions of their own and it does not lessen in any way the respect I have for Professor Fitzgerald that he expressed such an opinion.  That is exactly what it is — an opinion — and the views of the analysts in the article referred to by the Deputy are also opinions.  That is their status.  I have confirmed the official position, that there was no such instruction to the NTMA, and it has not suggested to me that any such contingency is being planned for.  I can only answer from the facts at my disposal in the NTMA.On the Labour Party proposal on the use of the pension fund, the fund's credibility in world markets depends on its commercial use.  It must be demonstrated that it ensures a return to itself in terms of its use and I fear, although I am open to examining the Deputy's proposal, that the structure is one where the funds of the pension fund would be re-routed through another vehicle without any return to the pension fund.I am prepared to examine any proposal for the constructive use of the funds at the disposal of the NPRF.

The Minister said NAMA was to deal with development loans but the purpose of NAMA was to free up credit for the SME sector.  There is no logical reason to transfer the remaining development loans from Anglo Irish Bank to NAMA.What is the expected cost to the taxpayer via the National Pensions Reserve Fund for the recapitalisation of AIB?  The bank is included in the special purpose vehicle for NAMA.  What are the implications for that investment with AIB nationalised?  Will it contravene state aid rules?The Minister mentioned the introduction of a special resolution regime.  Will that happen before Anglo Irish Bank is broken up?  The Minister referred to mutually beneficial discussions between the senior bondholders in the recovery bank in Anglo Irish Bank and the bank itself.

The resolution regime should be in place prior to that happening.The sheer scale of investment in the bank is horrific for ordinary taxpayers.  There will be a possible €53 billion, with at least €46 billion invested in the banks by the taxpayer.  Three of those banks are nationalised — AIB, Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The investment amounts to 25% of GDP, while the general Government deficit will be 32% of GDP.  The level of investment in the banks and NAMA comes to nearly 100% of gross domestic product.  The amounts involved are horrific.The Minister had two years to resolve the issue of the banks.  It was always the intention when the guarantee scheme was introduced to get credit flowing but that has not happened.  Speaking simplistically, if credit was to flow to the economy, it would be a strategy for growth.  At the moment businesses do not have working capital, meaning they cannot function, generate sales or buy stock.  It is something which needs to be examined in a very serious way.Furthermore, on the question of whether this process will get credit flowing, on the night when the guarantee scheme was put in place it was clear that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent.  We still do not know what actually happened during the discussion on the fateful night of 29 September when the heads of AIB and Bank of Ireland, on foot of discussions with Anglo Irish Bank, came to meet the Minister and the Taoiseach.  We do not known why they decided to go against the advice of Merrill Lynch and why they specifically included lower tier 2 subordinated debt.  We do not know those facts.I note the Minister is good at quoting script when it is of benefit but he dismisses it when it is not.  I also note——

The Minister can take this as he wishes.  He is a sweet talker and he has managed to sell a product.  It is like selling a car.  He sold a car but the parts are going off.

NAMA has not done what it was supposed to do.  We made a reasonable proposal and at the time the Minister argued on the basis of it.  We proposed that the banks would sort out the problem themselves.  There is one great flaw in NAMA, namely, it crystalises the losses and toxic loans straight away.  Furthermore, the bank debt is now a contagion for the sovereign debt, so much so that the Minister is not going to the bond auction next month or the following month.  There is a moratorium over Christmas.The NTMA has said for the past number of months that it was going to the bond auction because if it did not it would reduce confidence.  The Minister said today it is not going for two months.

This is about confidence.  We are funded until the middle of next year, but it is like being in business.  If one has a customer and one is not going to him or her, one can sometimes lose the customer.  I have no doubt if the Minister was sitting down in the cold light of day he would prefer to be going to the bond auction next month.  I have no doubt if the yield is lower the Minister will announce we are going for a bond auction, which I would welcome because we need certainty.  I do not wish to be personal.  Based on the policies which the Minister has implemented, the international markets are looking in great depth at the country including the €440 billion of the guarantee which they felt, on closer inspection, the State could not withstand.The Minister initially said Anglo Irish Bank would cost €4 billion.  It is now potentially €34 billion or a minimum of €30 billion.

That is based on discounts of 67% which I would say are reasonable, and if the discounts are 70% there will be a further €5 billion on top.  It is reasonable and if one examines the loan book within Anglo Irish Bank which we have seen, we know some of the loans it gave out were reckless in the extreme.

It is a reasonable point.  I do not wish to get personal but the situation as it stands is that between NAMA and the banks we have had a 100% increase in our national debt for which future generations will have to pay.  It is like someone buying a house or business for €200,000 and being told by the bank he or she will be given a loan for another €200,000 which it wants him or her to service as well.  There are questions to be answered.  We want it to go forward.  There are two key ingredients missing.The Minister is putting an extra €3 billion into AIB, which is the minimum he wants to take out of the budget this year.

In terms of the real economy, business credit has dried up.  If the Minister wants practical solutions, while we disagree on policy we believe the banks should have worked out their own loans and that the taxpayer should have been the last to pay.  In fact, the taxpayer is the first to pay.The Minister has held some renegotiations with subordinated debt holders through the various institutions but we will now have a situation whereby some mutually beneficial discussions will take place with senior bond holders.  To date, the taxpayer has put well in excess of €30 billion into the banks which will climb to €48 billion.  The international markets are now looking for certainty in terms of the four year plan the Minister is introducing.  In terms of dealing with the situation at hand, how is the Minister going to get a growth strategy going whereby we can service that level of debt regardless of who is in Government?Yesterday the Taoiseach quoted a figure of €30 billion for Anglo Irish Bank, 5% of which is €1.5 billion per year.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	646	If you take 5%, that is correct.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	647	Yes.  They are the Taoiseach's words.  That is €1.5 billion which will come out of vital services across the spectrum for the citizens who are paying taxes.  The problem with the banking system is that it has become about the process of NAMA, but no one considers the consequences.  The haircuts are so out of control that the taxpayers have to fill a big hole in the banks and the banks are more concerned with building their balance sheets.The Minister is wrong about Anglo Irish Bank.  He referred to NAMA and said it was about development loans.  NAMA was about going into institutions to take away the toxic loans in order that they could then lend.  The Minister admitted earlier that Anglo Irish Bank was never going to lend, rather it was a bank that he was going to shrink down in some form.  It makes no sense to transfer the balance of the remaining loans in Anglo Irish Bank into NAMA.  Bank of Scotland has its NAMA.  Anglo Irish Bank has its NAMA.  The problem is that we have a NAMA stuck in every corner which will all be competing with each other.  NAMA was supposed to bring about certainty but that has not happened.Does the Minister believe the €48 billion of taxpayers' money which has gone into the banks has resolved the banking situation?  Does he believe that, given the two year timeframe he had, that the banking system in Ireland is now functioning?  Anglo Irish Bank which is a dead bank, Irish Nationwide in its current incarnation is dead, Bank of Ireland is functioning and providing better credit than AIB which I accept — we know that from people on the ground — but is not functioning the way it should and AIB is the largest institution.There is a point which is often overlooked.  A lot of people are working in the front line in the banks that are getting a very difficult time.  The Minister took over AIB today.  Many of its directors have been there since 2007 and before.  I am not being personal about the individuals and the board of AIB.  The Minister needs to make a statement that there will be a new board in AIB, along with a CEO and chair.  That direction needs to be sent to the international markets.  It is in all of our interests that the bond yields for Irish sovereign debt should come down.  It is also in the interests of the banks.  I did not get an opportunity to ask the Minister a question about the funding requirements of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In his speech earlier today, the Minister suggested they have reached their end-of-year targets, more or less:In addition the cliff in the banks' refinancing requirements during the month of September, which had been a source of concern to the markets, has passed and the amount of term bank debt maturing over the remainder of this year and next year is quite limited.I would like to know the exact extent of the remaining requirements.This is a dreadful day for the ordinary person out there who is looking in.  It will have major consequences for small and medium sized enterprises and business people.  Will the sheer level of debt be the Minister's legacy?  In 20 or 50 years time, will future generations of Opposition Deputies come into the Chamber to talk about the fact that the element of the national debt relating to the recapitalisation of the banks has just been paid off?  I hope that will not be the case.  We have to get the real economy moving.  If we are to have growth, credit has to flow.  Regardless of whether I agree with what the Minister has done, it is fair to say credit is not flowing.  That has to be addressed.  A number of matters, including the whole issue of the guarantee scheme, need to be considered in that context.  I ask the Minister not to dismiss the proposal to establish a national recovery bank.  The principle behind the proposal is correct.  It is similar to the Labour Party's proposal to establish a strategic investment bank.  I hope the Minister will shed light on this matter.  This process should be about getting clarity, rather than bankrupting future generations.  Today's announcement is a manifestation of the Government's failure on banking policy.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	648	The authors of the Regling and Watson report suggested that the collapse in tax revenue was the main reason for the sharp increase in the fiscal deficit during the 2008-09 period.  They argued that there were a number of reasons for that collapse, most particularly the massive change in the taxation structure.  They pointed out that the Government, which has put its hands up in this regard, offered income tax cuts in order to achieve wage restraint.  They mentioned that the Irish taxation system favoured home ownership, and depended on it, without having a corresponding property tax.  They also claimed that the Government's changes in the structure of the system of taxation and expenditure inevitably contributed to the deficit we find ourselves experiencing.  One would think from the arguments made by the Labour Party in recent months — indeed, the last couple of years — that it opposed such policies when they arose, but nothing could be further from the truth.The 2007 Labour Party manifesto proposed a 2% cut in the standard rate of tax, from 20% to 18%.  That directly chimes with the reference in the Regling and Watson report to the offering of income tax cuts by the Government as one of the reasons the change in the structure of taxation resulted in a bigger deficit.  The Labour Party also proposed increases in personal tax credits and the home carer's allowance.  In addition to the indexation of the standard rate band, it wanted to provide for an additional increase of €5,000 in the transferable band for one-income and two-income families.  The Labour Party was offering all things to all men, in relation to tax cuts, at the time.  The Government has put its hands up with regard to the policies we pursued.  The suggestion that the Opposition was constantly telling us we were wrong is absolute nonsense.The Labour Party, in particular, acted as a cheerleader for tax reductions and thereby set off the auction politics of the 2007 general election.  It proposed a reduction in the standard rate band from 20% to 18%.  It produced a leaflet that claimed "taxes are low and will stay low".  Such an approach — the Government has admitted its part in it — contributed to the surge in the deficit, which is our most fundamental problem.  I believe it is a bigger problem than the banking crisis.  The Government will not take sole responsibility for it.  The parties that are now opposing everything on the way down were egging everything up on the way up.  This issue needs to be dealt with by the opponents of the Government.  Those who oppose everything should reflect on what they were saying at the time.  Were they saying "no, do not do this"?  In fairness, some people advised the Government not to do these things.  Such people, however, were certainly not the consistent naysayers on the Opposition benches.On this morning's "Morning Ireland", the Labour Party's spokesperson on finance said she would do things differently now.  She promised that the Labour Party would introduce bank resolution legislation if it were in government.  She claims such legislation would change things, for example by reducing costs substantially.  She ignored the fact that a bank resolution Bill is being introduced by the Government, but cannot be retrospective.  Existing contract law protects senior bond holders on the same basis as deposit holders.  That cannot be undone.  Any other interpretation of the situation is a pretence.  The Labour Party claims that its so-called solution, which it has not outlined, would result in substantial savings to the taxpayer.  Not alone has it failed to outline the details of the solution it claims to have, but it has also neglected to set out the savings that would result from it.  It cannot do so because it does not have an alternative to what the Government is doing, other than giving out.  I have given out about what is happening because I do not like to have to do it.  Other parties can protest.  I would certainly love to protest about some of the sums that are being expended in the cause of the banking system.  We have to be realistic.  We have to appreciate that no alternative has been proposed to the Minister for Finance.  He is on record as saying on a number of occasions that no alternative has been suggested to him in this regard.  The Labour Party has said that if its bank resolution legislation were introduced, substantial savings could be made.  The alternative it has offered is not good enough.  The people will see through it and are beginning to see through it.It is important to recognise there was a huge argument about subordinated debt, which the public may have latched onto.  It was not a very strong argument.  The point about subordinated debt is that it was always a small part of the guarantee.  None of it was paid out during the guarantee period.  In fact, it is no longer guaranteed.  I know the Minister intends to apply a steep discount to the subordinated debt that is outstanding from Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  It is not very significant, unfortunately, because it is a very small amount of money.  The bigger picture is the deposits and the senior debt which, in effect, is in the same position as the deposits.  The Government will protect deposit holders and deposits.  I refer both to the little old lady who is saving a very small part of her pension and to the international investor who is investing in this country, with substantial amounts on deposit in Irish banks.  Both kinds of people need to be honoured.  That is the job of the Government and I support it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I am glad that we have an opportunity to speak in this debate and that an extension of time was granted earlier.  Today we are seeing the result of the Government's banking strategy, not only over the two years since the guarantee, which predominantly involved crisis management, but also over ten years of light-touch financial regulatory incompetence.  The Minister said today that his statement brings full clarity on the costs and methods associated with recapitalising the Irish banks.  He claims we are now bringing closure to this banking nightmare.  I hope he is right this time, on the figures at least, and he does not have to revise them upwards again in the weeks ahead.  I refer particularly to the figures in relation to AIB.  Clarity on the actual monetary cost of recapitalisation is not the full story and certainly does not represent closure.  We should look at the evidence and the results of the Government's banking strategy.  I will begin by speaking about the public cost and the massive exposure of every family in this country.  A debt of between €45 billion and €50 billion will need to be repaid with interest.  The debt for Anglo Irish Bank alone is between €29.3 billion and €34.3 billion.  When AIB, Bank of Ireland, Irish Nationwide, EBS and Irish Life and Permanent are included, the total cost of recapitalisation across all Irish banks will be between €45 billion and €50 billion.  It may even be slightly above that.  That is the equivalent of approximately €12,000 for every man, woman and child in Ireland, plus interest.  One might suggest that some of the money will come from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, but I remind one that an opportunity cost is associated with the committing of that money.  However, there is also an opportunity cost of committing that money.  What has been crystallised today by the Minister is generational theft on a scale that is hard to comprehend.  Our generation will pass on a debt that will cripple younger generations through repayment obligations and will severely limit Ireland's capacity to grow, to create wealth and jobs, and to pay for essential services already been cut on a weekly basis.  That is a scandal that history will judge harshly, because it is the direct result of failed policy and practice banking.Bond markets are now effectively closed to Irish sovereign borrowing.  Confirmation of this is that we will not even attempt to raise money on international bond markets in October or November.  The essence of the Minister's rationale and thinking in terms of the approach that he has taken to date on banking policy, and in particular on senior bondholders and subordinate debt at Anglo Irish Bank, has been to ensure that we as a sovereign State maintain credibility with international markets.  Banking policy has been guided by the Government's determination to keep financial markets happy.  However, despite the transfer by the Government of bank debt into sovereign debt that our people will now have to shoulder, we lost the confidence of bond markets weeks ago.We are in the fortunate position, if anything about this is fortunate, of having raised sufficient capital through the NTMA to carry the country through until mid-2011.  Through the NTMA, we have been prudent enough to buy some time but there is no guarantee that the bond markets will view us favourably when we are required to return to raise funds in the new year.  However, this is not the full story because unfortunately banks in Ireland are not in the same position as the State in terms of borrowing ahead.  They have not borrowed to carry them into next year.  I understand that not only do bond markets not want to lend to the Irish State, but international markets do not want to lend to Irish banks either.  Therefore, it is the ECB, which is essentially a lender of last resort, that will continue to have to fund Irish banks.What does this mean in terms of a functioning banking system and providing liquidity in the Irish economy?  It means a tighter credit squeeze on small businesses and homeowners, and a more aggressive banking approach to shore up weak balance sheets.  It means banks will be even more risk averse to lending, and that is exactly what this economy does not need right now.  If we are to provide any stimulus, jobs growth and support for small and large businesses we must ensure they can access capital when they need it.  The consequences for SMEs of not being able to access capital and having their overdrafts turned into term loans, and the consequences for unfortunate homeowners who have variable mortgage interest rates, will be in all likelihood that they will face even higher interest rates on the repayments they make.  The unfairness of that is certainly not lost on the public.In simple terms, the Government has delivered, along with a rotten banking system, €50 billion of debt that we will hand on to taxpayers for the next ten years; no access to sovereign debt through bond markets in the short term; limited access to funds for Irish banks and the consequences of that for the economy; a hardening of bank policy in terms of lending and liquidity; and, of course, let us not forget a paralysed property market because of the consequences and lethargy of NAMA.  What could and should the Government have done differently?  Certainly, with regard to the bank guarantee of two years ago, it is now clear — this is supported by Patrick Honohan's report — that the State should not have guaranteed all debt in Anglo Irish Bank in full, and that it should have made a distinction between senior bondholders, subordinated debt, and deposit holders and other debt in Anglo Irish Bank.  However, it chose not to do so.  That mistake is now costing taxpayers in quite a significant way.To date, the NAMA experiment is failing.  Yes, it did crystallise losses and forced banks to address broken balance sheets.  However, it has also created total paralysis in the property market in Ireland, which is showing no signs of abating.  The Minister lays all of the blame at the feet of reckless banking and bankers.  He is right to express anger at banking behaviour and I think that is shared throughout the House and certainly among the public.  However, what has the Government done in response to that justified anger?  It is only today that the Minister is committing to replace the remaining management and board members in AIB, something for which we and the Labour Party have been asking for the past two years.As Deputy Seán Power asked today, where are the prosecutions?  In January 2009, the Garda raided Anglo Irish bank's headquarters in Dublin and we were told that a file would be sent to the DPP shortly.  When will that happen?On the more pragmatic issue of an insistence on external recruitment into Irish banks, we have seen a lack of determination and will coming from the Minister.  Due to the banking fiasco and the huge structural budgetary deficit of between €18 billion and €20 billion, the Government's options in the build up to the next budget are limited.  Irrespective of whether we like it, we are being forced to run our country to please international financial markets, or to at least reassure them, because we are entirely reliant on the capital they provide for the future functioning of our State if we are to avoid losing our economic sovereignty by accessing EU emergency funds.  Ireland needs to borrow approximately €55 million per day simply to meet our day-to-day expenditure and to bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.  That does not even include bank capitalisation costs.The context for framing the next budget is a tough one.  On the one hand, we must impress on markets that Ireland is implementing a credible plan over the next four to five years that can reduce the budgetary deficit and, on the other hand, we need to get stimulus into the economy because, as the Taoiseach has conceded and as we have been trying to say for many months, Ireland's problems will not be solved by cuts alone.Now it is even more complex than that for the Government because it is not just about one budget; it is about four budgets.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, has stated he intends to bring forward a framework to commit Ireland to a budgetary strategy for the next four years.  Let me tell him that he has no mandate to do that.  His Government is running out of time.  Even if it runs full term it has only another 18 months to run.  He has no mandate or right to commit Ireland to a budgetary strategy for the next four to five years.  I hope the Government will look on those two options as the only two that should be available to it.The idea that a Government that is in a very significant part responsible for the financial crisis that this country now faces, when we are on the brink of having to access emergency funding, and all of the strings that are attached to that where, essentially, we lose economic sovereignty, would have the arrogance to use its slim majority to drive through a budgetary package for the next four to five years when in all likelihood it will not be there for at least three of those years, is fundamentally undemocratic.  I, for one, as an Opposition spokesperson, would be willing to explore, obviously, the option of putting a new Government in place, but also the other option, if the Government chooses to go down that road.There is no credibility in putting together a four-year strategy if this Government is likely, as most people accept, to face a general election in the next six months.  For the sake of the country in terms of its credibility and its capacity to borrow money and attract investment and confidence again, there is an obligation either to get consensus on the really tough job of putting a four-year budgetary strategy together with parties that are likely to form the next Government or to step aside to allow the people to decide who will get a mandate to do that job.  I hope the Government will think about those options.  It is bad enough that they have taken us to this position, but the idea that they would have the arrogance to assume that they have the answers for the next four years when many of them are unlikely even to be in this Chamber for three of them is in my mind a step too far and fundamentally undemocratic and without mandate.My party has a positive contribution to make in terms of ideas on getting stimulus into this economy without resorting to borrowing and it is long past time that the Government engaged with us in a serious way to try to implement some of that thinking.  The Government asked Mr. Colm McCarthy to put together a report on the value and strategic importance of State assets such as the semi-State companies and how the Government could potentially reconfigure the portfolio of such companies to make them more effective and to improve their capacity to borrow money to front-load investment in infrastructure and to try to get stimulus into the economy in a way that is unconventional or, certainly, has not been part of Government thinking for the past ten years.  That report is due before Christmas, but in my view the Government does not have that much time.  There is an obligation now to listen to Opposition party thinking, in particular, on the semi-State sector and existing opportunities to raise significant amounts of capital by selling non-strategic assets in order to drive investment in new strategic assets that need to be built in Ireland anyway and will be built over the next five to ten years, but to do it in a way that can front-load that investment to try to get some stimulus into the economy at a time when it is desperately needed.  The priorities around those issues have been fast-forwarded because of the Government's challenges in terms of raising money for even basic expenditure into next year.Today is a sad day for Ireland.  It spells a failure of governance and leadership, and obviously, banking.  Ultimately, we are responsible as legislators.  The Government is responsible for how all elements of the economy operate, including banking.  We are the House that should have ensured that the necessary reins were in place to prevent the kind of gambling that has turned into massive debt, which has switched from bank debt to sovereign debt in Ireland.  Therefore, we have an obligation to look at politics in a way that perhaps we have not looked at it previously, in terms of partisanship in this House and the way in which political parties interact with each other.  I hope the challenges that we now face, when Ireland, as I described earlier, is on the brink of losing its economic sovereignty, will ensure the honest behaviour of Government in an effort to try to build consensus around how the country should move forward so that the next Government will be able to stand over decisions being made between now and Christmas.  However, I have my doubts.

There is a conviction on the part of the Government that, with today's announcements, we have finally hit the bottom as far as the banking situation is concerned and that potential liabilities have been defined.  Uncertainty as to the dimensions of the problem, coupled with the difficult budgetary decisions to be taken in the short to medium term, has caused many stresses in the market and challenges to our position over the past month or six weeks.  It is also fair to say that today also shows us the full dimensions of the banking calamity that has hit this country.There has been much discussion, and there will be more discussion and debate, about the causes of and responsibility for the banking crisis and what should have been done at various critical stages, up to and including today.  Government clearly bears an important responsibility, but there is also — I do not mean to include literally everyone in this — a collective responsibility.  Most people bought into and benefited in some way from the Celtic tiger.  Politically, people are not being honest if they claim that they saw the calamity coming.  It is quite true that Deputy Burton claims — I heard her do so — that she was critical of many of the property reliefs, but I would suggest that was much more motivated by equity considerations and traditional Labour thinking on what taxes wealthier people ought to pay than by the anticipated economic consequences, which Members are aware have turned into something close to catastrophe.  People from the Labour Party benches often stated that Ireland was the second richest country in the developed world, which nominally was true in GDP terms but not in real terms.  In addition, one of the mantras of the party's former leader was that the country was awash with money and ergo, more should be spent.  However, with the benefit of hindsight it is clear that in many respects spending should have been more restrained.Likewise, to defend Deputy Bruton, it is quite true that together with his party, he was highly critical of the benchmarking process.  Although that was something that I have defended and still defend, the rates of increase for public servants, including Members, at the middle and higher levels were excessive and certainly were far in excess of those experienced at lower levels of the Civil Service.  While Members may find it strange that I will cite someone who is not very popular on this side of the House, namely, Fintan O'Toole of The Irish Times, it appeared for a time as though we could have European-style social services for American levels of taxation.

When that comment was first made, Boston represented America, neoliberalism, light regulation and so on, while Berlin represented European social democracy.  There is a good case to be made that today, we perhaps are closer to Frankfurt than to Berlin or Boston.  As Frankfurt has a sort of rigour about it that would not necessarily always be welcome to European social democracy, there is a little irony in that debate.

Undoubtedly, low taxes for higher earners fuelled the property bubble and led people to spend money on all sorts of inessentials.  To the extent that there were warnings, and I suppose most Members would have been aware of them in the background over the years, in the main they were qualified by predictions of a soft landing.  The overwhelming consensus among economists, including the ESRI, was that for demographic and other reasons, we were heading for a soft landing, whereas we have experienced not just a hard landing but a crash landing.I can recall being a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which dealt quite a lot with banking.  During the middle of the last decade, the main issue was greater competition in banking.  There always was some concern about the very high level of bank profits and on the whole, we welcomed in competitors and so on.  However, as Members again know now with the benefit of hindsight, this in some ways exacerbated the situation, in that it led to a mad scramble for market share, to corners being cut and to safeguards being thrown to the wind.  In addition, as the Taoiseach certainly has implicitly acknowledged, the moves to phase out the property reliefs were much too gradual.I remember there was much concern at the beginning of the decade regarding the very steep rises in house prices and various measures were attempted on foot of the Bacon reports and so on to try to control and regulate that.  Ultimately, however, those attempts were largely abandoned and the policy was simply to increase supply, which did not anticipate that getting production up to approximately 91,000 houses being constructed in a year would result in a crash.  There were one or two economists who predicted that there would be a property crash and not a soft landing, certainly from 2006 if not earlier.  However, I believe even they did not anticipate the double whammy of the international crisis interacting with what has been called the homegrown one.Among the jobs of central bankers and regulators is the maintenance of financial confidence.  While they often have concerns, they are unlikely to vent them in public except in careful ways.  Many times over the decades in different countries, one has seen central bankers saying something that then is taken up in a certain way by markets with short-term dramatic financial consequences.  Consequently, it must be understood that central bankers are cautious in spreading alarm, other than in the fairly typical and unsurprising tones that they always strike in respect of financial caution.Unfortunately, markets, particularly when there is much uncertainty and volatility, are not rational.  This was to be seen clearly in 2008 in particular.  One could make all sorts of arguments, had they been acting rationally, as to the reason they should have done this or that.  That may be true but when one faces something close to market hysteria, one must consider very carefully how one will react to it.  Small countries — by which I mean small in terms of population — such as Ireland and peripheral countries undoubtedly were judged to have done exceptionally well in the earlier part of the decade and to have done better than bigger countries such as Germany, France, Britain and so on.  However, in a situation such as that faced by Ireland in September 2008, a small economy out of balance was much more vulnerable than a larger country.Opposition and media, which I am not criticising as they are doing their job, can discuss and put forward alternative courses of action, as is their duty.  However, only Government and related State authorities are answerable for the consequences of their decisions.  There is little doubt that the action taken by the Government at the end of September 2008 did prevent a widespread banking collapse with disastrous and disruptive consequences.The argument about whether subordinated debt should have been included is a sideshow because, although it was covered — it is covered no longer — it has not cost the taxpayer.  This has been illustrated by quotations at various points along the line but I am sure similar quotations could be found in quarters other than those of the Government.  The full dimensions of the hole the banks were in has only gradually become evident.  There is no doubt that banks tended to want to hide their problems or put up a front of confidence to show they could sort them.  The Minister has stated this.The Government has put in place successive measures, up to and including today, to deal with the fallout from the situation, including recapitalisation, NAMA etc.  I do not want to cover ground that has been well covered.  We had to do what was necessary.  The reliability and creditworthiness of this country is terribly important to maintain.  It could be argued that it has been somewhat battered in the past couple of years.  However, I heard Madam Christine Lagarde, the greatly respected French Finance Minister, state today she trusts Ireland.  It is also clear from the Commission's comments that it trusts us.One can argue about a partial default — it is perfectly legitimate to do so — but the argument is profoundly mistaken.  I refer to today as opposed to September 2008.Ireland has been up-front about its problems.  I am not certain that can be said of all euro zone countries.  I was deputising for the Minister at an ECOFIN euro zone meeting in the middle of July.  One of my duties was to disclose to colleagues the figures that were valid at the time.  I disclosed that the budget deficit for this year was to be 20%.  It is now to be 32%.  There is no doubt my disclosure caused a distinct frisson in the room.  Obviously I explained the reasons, which pertain to EUROSTAT.  As we know, the deficit is once off, but obviously what we do as a euro zone member is of profound interest to other euro zone countries because, no matter how small our economy is as a proportion of the total euro zone, it is clear that even the smallest country can affect the euro zone as a whole.  Our economy comprises 1% of the euro zone and 2% of the economy of the European Union as a whole.  This and future Governments will have to operate within very tight constraints.The cost of the banking crisis, certainly that of Anglo Irish Bank, is rather less than the deficit for this year and last year.  It is clear that the real challenge we now face, having dealt with the banking crisis, is to formulate a budget and budgetary strategy for the next four years.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I would like to structure my comments in three parts.  First I want to review the history of events before 29 September 2008.  Second, I want to consider the options presented to this House at that time and the directions that were taken subsequently.  Third, I want to examine what we must now do.  I will try to speak as quickly as possible and I hope brevity will not be confused with a scarcity of thought.History is always rewritten and the voices that have an alternative view are dismissed or ignored, unless it suits the prevailing orthodoxy not to do so.  In the run-up to the crisis, many people were saying the Irish economy was out of control and that the banking system was over-reliant on property.  It was also stated we were excessive in our spending.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, referred to people saying that this country was awash with money.  I remind him that it was his colleague, the former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who made that observation.  It was said there was excessive spending and that we were just going along with the good times and the boom and that there was really no alternative.  Ms Margaret Thatcher referred to this as "TINA".There was an alternative.  When the rainbow coalition left Government in 1997, we were moving relentlessly in the direction of qualifying for the single currency.  That single currency presented two phenomena that this economy never had before, namely, low interest rates and low inflation, which the Germans had battled for following the collapse of the Weimar Republic due to hyperinflation and the rise of Nazism.  Germany and the rest of Europe had to learn this lesson at a very costly price.As somebody said to me when I left the Department of Finance in 1997 and as we entered the harbour of the euro zone, instead of the Department of Finance and the then new Minister for Finance learning how to behave like Germans, they continued to act like Italians.  There was a failure in governance in the Department of Finance, both at official and political levels.  Ultimately, ministerial political responsibility is the final point of authority.  Not only was there failure in the Department but also in the Central Bank, including in respect of the subsequent division of the regulatory authorities, which was done at the expense of allowing the Central Bank to continue as it had done.  Mr. Michael McDowell, former Minister and Attorney General, was obsessed with the separation of the two.  Even when the then Governor, Mr. John Hurley, published his quarterly reports and drew attention to the over-reliance on property, nobody seemed to be listening.  Since there was nobody listening, inflation in the property sector was to many people a connivance and a conspiracy, with the Galway tent the symbol of the unhealthy political relationship between landowners, developers and builders and the Fianna Fáil Party in Merrion Street.  Long after they were no longer needed, pro-cyclical tax breaks were retained which ensured that everybody at the front end of the transaction chain was incentivised to encourage more lending, more property development, more rezoning, and more selling on to innocent would be landlords who believed becoming a landlord would be easy.I will relate an anecdote to illustrate the point I am making.  In the early spring of 1997, on a visit to Sligo and Leitrim in the run-up to the election later that year, I met our then parliamentary colleague, Declan Bree, in Carrick-on-Shannon for the start of a one-day tour of that constituency.  The first meeting that had been organised was with the Chamber of Commerce in Carrick-on-Shannon, a place that is familiar to most Deputies.  The usual formalities were observed; I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is more than familiar with the protocols associated with these types of meetings.  When I asked the chamber members how we could assist them, the response was that what they sought was section 23, which had become the generic term for tax breaks on property and which in this case referred to the urban renewal scheme which was first introduced in the early 1980s.  When I asked them what part of the town they had in mind they told me I had misunderstood them and that they did not wish to discriminate within the town of Carrick-on-Shannon nor within the county of Leitrim.  In other words, they wanted what were officially known as urban renewal tax-led incentives for the entire county.

However, if I am accurate in my recollection, within 18 months the new Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, went one step further by designating the entire upper Shannon area under section 23.  The consequences of that are self-evident.I am told that when the Leinster rugby team went professional and its young athletic players in their early 20s suddenly found themselves with salaries out of all kilter with what their peer group was experiencing at that time, they were encouraged by financial advisers to put their money in property as the Eircom share issue experiment had bombed.  Many of them purchased apartments in Carrick-on-Shannon.  Some of them go up there periodically to have a barbecue or party, but those properties are essentially wasting away.  These guys felt that since they were paying very heavy taxes — which, in fact, they were not — that this was a type of no-cost option.  All of the people in the transaction chain were front-loading.  They assumed no responsibility because they were not travelling the same journey as the people who bought into these types of developments.  The landowner, builder, auctioneer and solicitor were all there at the beginning, but they assumed no responsibility for what has happening.The upshot of all of this was the massive dependence on property to which the Minister of State referred.  The Minister of State suggested that we could not have done anything else.  That is not the case.  While the Opposition must be constrained in some of its comments because we are not in possession of all the facts, governments can and do take action.  The Government could have dampened down the spending explosion by way of additional taxation.  Some positive actions were taken by Mr. McCreevy, particularly the investment of the proceeds of the Eircom privatisation into the National Pensions Reserve Fund.In general, however, instead of leaving tax breaks in place and incentivising banks to get rid of the money accruing to them by offering it, at apparently low risk, to customers in order to unlock equity in their primary residence for the purpose of investing in property, the Government should have harnessed the energy, expertise and resources of the construction industry to build, for example, decent schools.  As we speak, there are 50,000 primary school children that we know of learning in prefabricated buildings.  Some children will spend their entire primary school experience in a prefabricated construction.  Money should have gone into that type of long-term infrastructural investment.This would have had two effects.  First, it would have provided decent school buildings of a standard which one would expect.  Second, it would have soaked up capacity within the construction industry and prevented the hyper-inflation in property prices that developed.  Development of the public sector could not proceed at a reasonable pace because the prices quoted by the private sector construction industry — the capacity of which was so stretched that we had the proverbial Polish plumber coming to Ireland and not France — for far more tightly regulated public sector contracts were simply nominal prices the purpose of which was to deliver the message that the public sector should get lost.  The industry was more than happy to continue its jerry-building and lightly regulated activities in the private sector.The property boom coincided with the over-extending of credit to individuals who had no experience of investing in property or becoming landlords.  It was made to appear absolutely effortless.  When the crash came following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the impact in this country for individuals was far higher than it was in any other country.  One of the reasons people are so angry is that they are up to their oxters in debt.  The 1980s were tough enough because the country was in debt, but there was very little private sector or personal debt.  People are seething with anger because they were encouraged to over-extend themselves and now feel duped.  This is not to say there was not an element of greed in all of this.  These were so-called responsible adults who are ultimately responsible for their own actions.  However, they had no experience of any of this.  When the Minister of State and I were of college-going age we were not receiving letters from our bank offering an extension of €10,000 on our overdraft.  We might have put the money into prize beer but not into prize bonds.That culture was there and we were all talking about it.  Yet the Department of Finance did not intervene, the Minister for Finance did not intervene, the Central Bank did not intervene and the regulatory authorities did not intervene.  When some people suggested there was something wrong with the system, they were told by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in a speech in Donegal, that if they were so pessimistic about the Irish economy and so worried about the future, why did they not simply go off and commit suicide.  That is where we were.This time two years ago the Government was faced with a crisis.  It must have been extremely scary for those directly involved, most of whom, including the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had come to their jobs very recently.  The Minister is a very talented barrister and without question a very able individual, but he has none of the economic experience that would have been of help.  It will be for the history books to tell us the facts of what happened that night two years ago, if those facts were recorded in a format that will ensure they end up in the archives.  From what we know, it is my guess that the banks lied through their teeth to the Government on the night in question and that people were spooked, just as Allied Irish Banks spooked the Government back in the 1980s when we were left with the mess of ICI.There were two options available to the Government two years ago.  The first was simply to take Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks — the systemically important banks for the regular operation of our economy — into temporary public ownership, and to take into nationalised ownership the basket case that was the boutique Anglo Irish Bank.  For reasons that may only emerge in the future, that option was turned down by the Ministers in question and, as I understand it, by senior officials in Merrion Street.  Instead we had the NAMA concept which nobody fully understood.  We also had the underwriting of the guarantee in respect of which — let the record show — Labour Party did not oppose Second Stage on that evening two years ago.  We did not oppose the principle of a guarantee.  When we explored the implications of this guarantee with the current Minister, what we got was waffle.  It was very eloquently phrased waffle, but waffle.  Faced with a lack of clarity we opposed the Bill.  We were the only party in this House to oppose it, not on Second Stage but on Final Stage.NAMA has been a moving target of facts.  When it came to evaluating how much it was going to cost and how long it would take and so on, the narrative changed each time.  Medium-term economic value is an economic concept that does not, to the best of my knowledge, exist in any economic textbook of which I am aware and I would not describe myself as an economist.  What would have happened had the Labour Party proposal at that time been undertaken?  Our proposal was that we get rid of the Governor and entire board of the Central Bank because they had failed and appoint a new Governor.  As it turns out the new Governor is an excellent individual of international reputation who has done a spectacular job so far.  We would not have stopped there.  We would have sought the establishment of a banking commission, headed up by an Irish person of international reputation but specifically and uniquely made up of, say, a former German central banker and former American central banker, people of credibility so that the international community would realise we were having a serious look at ourselves and this was not some type of Sicilian inquiry run by Sicilians.We would then have taken Anglo Irish Bank and put it where it is; a clapped out bank.  We would then have taken on the two systemic banks that we need, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, whose share value had collapsed to what it is today, approximately 50 cent.  We would have got them for virtually nothing.  We would then have recapitalised them and, not nationalised them, but taken them into temporary public ownership and said, not through some slash and burn intervention but in an orderly way: "Thank you for your services but we are going to replace you."  We would then have said to the next tier of management — we have very good experienced prudent banking management as the history of those two banks has demonstrated over the past number of years — here is the deal: "We want you to fix this bank and run it so that the economy once again functions; your salary, if you take the job, is what you are currently on plus 10%.  There will be no bonuses but in seven to ten years time when we refloat these two banks in a much stronger economy the State will take from that flotation the equity it has put in plus the accumulated cost the taxpayers had to pay — that is all we would want as we would not necessarily be trying to make a profit from this — with the balance going to the shareholders and, by the way, we will ring-fence 5% of the equity raised and that will be divided among yourselves by way of bonus."  We would then request that the following morning they work to get the Irish economy functioning.What is happening now is that the economy is not functioning.  We need an economy that is growing.  I accept it will grow slowly at first because confidence is shattered.  I know what this means because the economy was previously shattered in 1991-1992 and in the early part of 1993 when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There is a lag in terms of confidence and market reality.  Had the two main banks started lending to the private sector this time two years ago we would be in a far different place now.  I have heard from Chambers of Commerce and individual business people that AIB and, to a lesser extent, Bank of Ireland, in order to avoid falling into a situation whereby its majority shareholding is owned by the State they have been extracting capital from ordinary small businesses.  Let us take a book shop as an example, the total sales of which, as the Minister of State well knows, peaks between September and Christmas.  The remainder of the year overheads are higher than income.  This type of business needs a facility with the bank to cover the 12 month cycle.  This is normal practice in any type of cyclical business.  What the banks have been doing is unilaterally changing the terms of overdrafts and increasing the terms, conditions and interest rates on these facilities.  This is the reason for the dip in the second quarter of economic activity in our economy.It is hoped that given we are to be a 91% owner of AIB and, possibly, a 50%, if not close to it, shareholder in Bank of Ireland, that Merrion Street, the Minister, Deputy Lenihan and Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will do as was done with Irish Life.  In the 1930s, the life assurance industry was restructured and Irish life was established from the remnants of four failed entities.  The Government then stood back from it and allowed it to reconfigure and get on with running a commercially vibrant business.  The great success of Irish Life is that it was 98% owned by Merrion Street and there was virtually no political interference in its operation just as there was no political interference with the operation of Renault in France as distinct from the BMC in Britain.  It was a commercial operation.  The contrast was the constant interference with ACC at the behest of the farming community.The Government now owns AIB.  For God's sake, do not screw it up.  Change the management along the lines I have set out, bring in new directors, keeping the public interest directors on board and then give them a remit and tell them you will not second guess their commercial decisions.  The fear Merrion Street officials have of being responsible for a bank will then be insured and protected.  The sole job of AIB and Bank of Ireland will be to grow the economy, slowly at first because that is how it will start.  If it is allowed to start slowly without interference it will then start providing working capital.  There is an enormous amount of capital in this country; the savings ratio has never been higher.  If it does this, we will have the type of economic growth that will enable us to draw down the national debt and bring it back to manageable proportions, which is possible.  If we do not do this, we will be in serious trouble.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I wish to share time with Deputy Reilly.One of the strangest things about politics is that one never knows what is going to happen on any particular day.  I thought today was going to be a quiet day as I had only two meetings to attend and a few phone calls to make.  Then came the opinion poll last night followed by a phone call at 11 p.m. informing me that AIB was to be effectively nationalised today and asking if I would be available for a meeting this morning.Earlier today I read an article, not about opinion polls or banks in Ireland but about the fact that today Germany paid the last instalments of its war reparations from the First World War, the war from 1914-1918.  I did not realise Germany was still paying those reparations.  I had thought the reparations had partly led to the Second World War and had all been forgotten after that.  However, seemingly that was not the case.  Germany paid its last instalment to France and Britain today.  It occurred to me that there has been an economic war in Ireland and that we, the Irish people, even though we were not participants in it, have become the losers.  On our bill now is between €50 billion and €65 billion that will be given to the banks.  What this means is interest payments of, say, €1.5 billion to €2 billion per annum forever, namely, 3 to 4 cents on every euro earned in my lifetime, the lifetime of my children and, potentially, the lifetime of their children.  I saw the similarities between the war reparations which Germany is now finally paying.After two years of austerity, pay cuts, tax increases, cuts to services and bank bail outs, the public and the country are no better off than we were at the start of all of this.  When one has had in place for two years a set of policies from which one does not see results, one must ask if they are working or if they are right.  They are not right and they are not working, of that I am becoming increasingly convinced.  Let us look at the Government's banking policies to date.  First, we had the guarantee, which was two years old yesterday.  The guarantee did not cause the losses in the banks and they would eventually have had to be dealt with some way or other but it did at least give the Government a timeframe, a two year period, to sort out the banking system but it did not do that.  All the guarantee did was buy time, time that the Government should have used to restructure and recapitalise the banks but did not do so.  That is the real failure, not the guarantee which, because it was too extensive, did limit the Government's policy options.  The real crime was the Government's failure to restructure and recapitalise the banking system in the two-year period since the banking guarantee was introduced.  The first Government recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland took place just before Christmas 2008.  I recall the time because I travelled to RTE to discuss the matter on "Morning Ireland".  It announced another recapitalisation in early 2009 followed by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the effective nationalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency has been followed up with today's announcement of a third recapitalisation, which does not include the recapitalisation of AIB, INBS and EBS under the NAMA process, and a de facto fourth nationalisation.The Government must be honest and stop denying that its policies are not working.  The €45 billion figure announced today is not the end of the matter because until such as time as we accept that the current policies have failed, it will be necessary to put more money into the banks.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated that today was a final staging post and provided certainty and clarity, while the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, argued that we have finally hit the bottom.  I have seen enough over the past two years not to believe either statement.  The Government told us that the cost of Anglo Irish Bank would be €4.5 billion.  The final figure will be closer to ten times that estimate than seven times the estimate.The Government argued that the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency would result in a wall of cash feeding into the economy.  This did not transpire.  It also called that Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks were well capitalised, strong and fundamentally sound when that was clearly not the case.  No one who has been awake for the past two years would possibly believe that we have today drawn a line under the cost of the bank bailout.  Now that the State owns Allied Irish Banks, it can start to go through its books.  I believe it will find that the bank is in a much worse state than we have been given to believe and that its developer and commercial property loans are as bad as those of Anglo Irish Bank, and that its mortgage books and credit card debts are full of serious holes.  I suspect the House will be informed in a few months that €10 billion was not sufficient for AIB and the bank may need €20 billion.  The argument then will be that having spent €60 billion, why should we not spend another €60 billion.The flaw in the Government's approach to the banks is its underlying philosophy that bank debts are State debts and Irish people must bear the burden of the losses and debts the banks have run up.  The Government argues — sincerely, I believe — that if we do not take the debts of the banks on our shoulders, we will not be able to borrow the money required to run public services.  It genuinely believes this to be the case even though it is clearly not true because despite having taken the debts of the banks on our shoulders, we cannot borrow money for public services.  Ireland will not even go to the markets until January.  I am not convinced the markets will be open to us when we go to them in January.  The evidence for this is available.  The Government was wrong on this matter because, having taken the debts of the banks on our shoulders, we are no longer able to borrow to pay for public services.Essentially, the Government has torn up the rules of free market capitalism.  While I accept that some of the over-exuberance of capitalism helped cause the crisis, the Government has essentially socialised the losses and debts of the banks by offering socialism for the banks and no one else.  It should have applied the basic rules of capitalism and required that the banks enter resolution, the bondholders become the owners of the banks, have a debt for equity swap and in some way negotiate down the bonds.  That should have been the principle but the Government's principle has been to keep the show on the road and maintain the same old banking system as if nothing had happened.  Even the idea of keeping 10% of the bank in private hands for the sake of it does not make any sense.  Why pretend that the banks can go back to the way they were when that is not possible?The Irish people will not be able to pay the bill.  We are informed the final bill will be €45 billion.  I believe it will be higher, as do all of those who have been right in the past two years.  I believe it will €50 billion, €60 billion or perhaps €70 billion.  We cannot afford to pay it and should admit that.  The price of the banking collapse in this country is huge compared to collapses in Britain, the United States or Germany.  What we have here is much more akin to the banking collapse in Iceland.  We should be honest and admit that and stop pretending that we can pay the bill.We must accept that Government policy is not working.  We must end the denial, face up to the truth and deal with the problem.  This will require making four policy changes.  We need a new banking system.  While it is possible that Bank of Ireland may be able to continue in some form and, over time, restore its position, it is clear this is not possible in the case of the other banks which are all effectively in State ownership.  The Government must accept this and merge the State banks, break them up and rebuild them or take whatever action is necessary to carve out new banks from the four nationalised financial institutions.  It must tell shareholders that their money is gone and creditors that they will lose much of their money.  It must carve out new banks that will lend money and reinvigorate the economy.  That is all the Government can do at this stage.The economy also requires stimulus.  Deputy Simon Coveney and other members of my party have shown how to do this without borrowing, for example, by using money from the pension fund or generating money from the sale of State assets.We also need to improve cost competitiveness in this country.  I hope we do not end up having to do this by leaving the euro.  If we do not improve cost competitiveness, we will fall out of the euro, possibly in a very dramatic way.The fourth step is to reduce the deficit but this must be done over time.  We need to accept that we will probably not be able to achieve the 3% target by 2014.  We must be honest in this matter to members of the public and the rest of the word.  While the idea of having a four-year scheme is welcome, when people see the details of the budgetary consolidation programme they will decide it would be impossible to implement it without destroying the economy.  We need to consider this issue and discuss it with our European partners, the International Monetary Fund and others who can help us rectify our financial position.  I am certain that today is not the end of this matter and the House will be told some time in the future that we have more war reparations to pay.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  This is a very bad day for Ireland and Irish people.  Yet again, as my colleague Deputy Varadkar stated, we have been told we have turned a corner or reached finality.  We have heard many metaphors in the past two years but they amount to nothing more than meaningless bluff.I remind Deputies that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, informed the House that the Government's approach would be the most cost-effective way of dealing with the banking problem and we could even turn a profit through NAMA and other measures.  We were then told the cost of the banking measures would be €4 billion, a figure which later increased to €10 billion, €20 billion and €28 billion.  This morning we were told that Anglo Irish Bank alone, in a worst-case scenario, will cost €34 billion.The €34 billion must be taken as the minimum final figure because on every other occasion, the worst-case scenario, as enunciated by the Minister for Finance, has been surpassed.  This figure does not include the €6 billion required by Irish Nationwide and the additional €3.5 billion announced for AIB.The Government's banking strategy has cost the country a fortune and ruined the economy.  Notwithstanding the Minister's statement that his measures would settle the market and make it easier for Ireland to borrow, it has had the opposite effect, to the point that we have had to withdraw from the market for fear that an auction would fail or the interest rates offered to us would be so extreme as to be unaffordable.  What do I mean when I state the Government's banking strategy has ruined the country for its citizens?  What it means in hard, cold facts is 462,000 people unemployed, which is 200,000 more than when the Government returned to power in 2007.  It means 100,000 people emigrating by next spring, people who are terminally ill being unable to get medical cards and a reduction in the allowances for disability, and all for nothing.  It is being done so that all this money can be invested in the banks while the taxpayers and ordinary citizens of this country suffer.  Some 2,500 people per week are having their electricity disconnected and businesses are hanging on by the skin of their teeth or their fingernails.Our health system is in chaos and further chaos threatens.  This day six years ago we got a new Minister for Health and Children and there was great hope that the morass of the health service and its lack of reform could be sorted out.  Six years later it is worse than ever.  That is not the subject we are here to discuss.As the Fine Gael finance spokesman said, it is more money for the banks and more misery for the taxpayers and citizens.  This proves that the Minister's banking policy is in shreds.  Notwithstanding what other action he takes, the economy is mortally wounded by this.When Professor Honohan was asked today if this was the end of the matter, he said it was, at this stage.  The qualifier was there.  I must share the pessimism of my colleague, Deputy Varadkar.  Why would the Government not listen to the Fine Gael position and to the suggestions we put forward?  Why, when the guarantee was introduced two years ago, was the House told there was a liquidity problem?  The Government must have known it was a solvency issue.  Anglo Irish Bank had told the Bank of Ireland only days previously that it was broke.  Long before that, knowing there was an escalating crisis, surely the Minister for Finance must have asked his officials, the regulator and others to assess the balance sheets of the banks.  It is incredible that the Government did not know there was a solvency crisis and, as such, misled this Chamber into voting for the bank guarantee.The bank guarantee was too extensive.  There were repeated refusals to wind down Anglo Irish Bank and deal with subordinated bond holders.  Everyone knows that subordinated bond holders get a premium on their interest rate for the additional risk they perceive they are taking.  Any punter knows that when the punt goes wrong, they take the hit.  We decided to guarantee everything.  There is still money to be saved if negotiations take place.Deputy Varadkar referred to the deliberate confusion by the Government of sovereign debt and bank debt.  Many people on this side of the House believe this is what the Government truly believed and that is why the Government did what it did and made such a mess of things.  Equally, there is talk of default as opposed to renegotiation.  If it is true that Anglo Irish bonds are changing hands at somewhere between 17 cent and 35 cent in the euro, there is no reason the Minister, the Central Bank and others cannot renegotiate our exposure along that level.The only way we will get out of this financial morass is with honesty and transparency.  While M. Jean-Claude Trichet congratulates us and commends us on our four-year strategy to deal with our budgetary situation and the Government promises to do this, can anyone in this country have any belief in its ability to do it?  Will the Government have any credibility in international markets, given that any strategy it devises will not last?  The Government will be out of power by March 2011, in my view, but certainly by May 2012.  What good is a four-year strategy?  What credibility does it have?Today is a very dark day for this country.  It is clear who is responsible for turning out the lights.  It is the Fianna Fáil Government and its Minister who blindly followed this course and refused to listen to those on this side of the House and to many other experts who were accused at every step along the way of economic treachery.  I remind the Government that the best option open to it, if it truly cares about this country, is to go to the country, let the people have their say and give a mandate to a new Government that can deal with the crisis.  After two and a half years, the Government is incapable of dealing with it.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13812	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	660	Earlier today, Deputy Joan Burton stated the following:Today, we have been given more bad news about the two institutions to which I refer.  The Financial Times  states that the cost in respect of Anglo Irish Bank will be €35 billion and €5 billion for the tiny building society that is known as Irish Nationwide.That is the pass to which the Minister and his leader, the Taoiseach, have brought this country.  Today is black Thursday and the Minister and his party, Fianna Fáil, will be remembered for visiting it upon this country.I am an optimistic person by nature.  I came into this House in 2007 as an Opposition Deputy.  When my party, the Labour Party, is elected to govern this country, how will we get it out of the economic maelstrom in which we find ourselves?  To say it will be a Herculean task is to put it mildly.I listened intently to the contributions from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, which looked backwards in their analysis of the situation.  They do not give me grounds for optimism.  It was especially disheartening to hear someone of my own generation, Deputy Thomas Byrne, seeking to undermine the Labour Party as part of his contribution to a debate on the financial institutions as they are now.  When the Deputy referred to Labour's 2007 manifesto and the promises or aspirations contained therein, he neglected to mention that those promises and aspirations were based on figures that were then in the public domain.  The figures to which I refer were provided by the Department of Finance and the plans in the manifesto were costed in respect of the economic climate that obtained at that time.  It is not credible for a member of Fianna Fáil to attack the Labour Party for what has happened in the past two years, even if doing so is part of some defence mechanism.I have stated publicly on previous occasions that I have a great regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, particularly in the context of the depth of knowledge he possesses and the values he espouses.  However, the Minister of State indicated earlier that because Madame Christine Lagarde has bestowed her imprimatur on the strategy that has been adopted, this is somehow a justification——
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I did not say that.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13812	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	662	——for that strategy.  Madame Lagarde is representative of the centre right in France and is a member of President Sarkozy's Government.  I would not be looking to France in search of a degree of comfort or solace with regard to this country's current economic position.  We are, however, very fortunate that we are part of the European Union and that we have access to the European Central Bank, ECB.  I suspect the latter shored up our position in respect of the bond issue in recent weeks.  I would be anxious to discover the degree to which the ECB intervened in this regard.There is no doubt that this is a black day.  However, I am moved to state that I am of a generation that benefited from the fact that, socially, politically and economically, Ireland looked outwards during the 1980s and 1990s.  We drew economic strength from the pooling of sovereignty that occurred with our European neighbours at that time.  As a result of this, people of my generation benefited by being able to travel, obtain an education and gain proper employment.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, we thought we could go it alone.  We became extremely greedy and selfish and began to look inwards again.  In order to claw our way out of the morass in which we find ourselves, we will be obliged to look outwards once again.  We must work with our European neighbours in order to find solutions to the economic problems that exist.I sat the leaving certificate in 1991.  I am of the generation which benefited from the abolition of university fees.  Many of the other members of my generation who also benefited in this way travelled the world for a number of years and returned to Ireland when the economic climate appeared brighter.  These people, some of whom are friends of mine, got married, had children and bought houses for astronomical prices.  It is our generation that will be obliged to pay for the profligacy and disastrous economic policies preferred by the so-called republican party.If it is given the opportunity to govern, the Labour Party, and people of my generation, will get us out of the morass to which I refer.  In the past it was the Labour Party which made the ultimate sacrifice.  During previous periods of severe economic difficulty, it was my party which took the tough decisions that were necessary to place the country back on an even keel.  The country has been holed below the water line but we are not beaten yet.  I refuse to be beaten.  I am of that generation of politicians whose members will be obliged to look not two or three but rather 20 years hence in order to identify how we want our society to develop.  We will be obliged to set down a formula to achieve our goals in this regard.The figures that emerged earlier today mean the next Government, of which I am sure Labour will be a part, will be at a disadvantage in the context of being able to repair the damage that has been done.  That is a message which must be put across.  We will not give up on the Irish people.  Although there is an air of despair and depression in this Parliament today, I can inform the Minister of State that we will fight with every fibre of our beings in order to try to claw our way out of our current difficulties.  The Irish people will do so because they are resourceful.Deputy Quinn referred to the time he spent as Minister for Finance.  When it is once again in government, the Labour Party will work to claw the country out of the mess in which it currently finds itself.  We may, as in the past, pay the ultimate price by losing the general election which follows.  However, we will do what is necessary because we are patriots.  We will not do what is required for personal gain, we will do it because we believe in this country and its people.It will take a great deal of time to do what needs to be done.  A message must be sent to the people that it will be the Labour Party that will rectify the problems caused by the policies that were followed during the past 13 years.  It will not be easy and the people know that.  What citizens want is some honesty.  If the Labour Party is honest and states that the next five years are going to be tough but that there will be a point below which no citizen will be permitted to fall, I am of the view that the people will give us the chance to do what is required.  That is all we are seeking.I wish to refer to an article by Colm Keena in The Irish Times on 21 September.  Mr. Keena reported that:The Governor of the Central Bank has indicated he believes the December budget should involve a package of cuts in excess of €3 billion so Ireland can keep reducing its deficit on track.Prof Patrick Honohan said yesterday the Government's multi-year plan for reducing the deficit needed "explicit reprogramming" and this was "clearly necessary soon".  He did not want to go into detail for any given year, but there was an overall need for reprogramming...If the economy stayed on track with what had been initially envisaged, the deficit would come close to 3 per cent by 2014.  "But as the IMF and others have noted, the real economy, the price level and interest rates on Government borrowing have evolved in a less favourable way.  Servicing of the additional debt related to bank restructuring is also a negative factor."With the passage of time, one comes to learn what is meant when language is used in a certain way.  The term "explicit programming" is code for stating that a deficit target of 3% by 2014 is just not tenable.  That is particularly true in light of the figures produced today.  Where does this leave us?Deputy Coveney brought some degree of realism to the debate by outlining an agreed approach in terms of how we might proceed.  I am sure the Deputy's thoughts in this regard are based on his experiences as an MEP.  In Europe, programmes are multi-annual in nature and there is a political consensus in respect of them.  We need to ensure that our European partners will allow for the fact that the banking crisis has cost us so much that any servicing of a deficit or any stimulus package will be a major challenge and that we need some degree of stability and political consensus as to how that might be reached.  An election tomorrow morning would clear the air and allow for an alternative government to be able to tell the people that we are starting on a new footing.  We could also say to our partners in the European Union and the European Commission that there is a new impetus as to how we can get ourselves out of the mess in which we find ourselves, but that it might take longer than the period envisaged in the target to reduce the deficit to less than the 3% by 2014.Ireland is a test bed and there is no paradigm for where we are at the moment.  Nobody in Europe can judge how this will pan out.  It would be fundamentally dishonest for me as a representative of the people of Cork East to say that I know exactly what the answers are because I do not.  I am trying to grapple with these figures and it is impossible.  It would be wrong of me to claim there is a model for where Ireland is now, which is why we need to work outwardly and why our membership of the European Union will ultimately be our saviour.  Many of my fellow citizens would claim that some of the blame for this should be laid at the door of Europe.  When people speak of Europe they do so as a concept that is somehow out there, but we are Europe.  While we may be on the periphery geographically, we are part of that decision-making process and we may need more help from our European neighbours to ensure that we can rebuild from the ashes of a republic that is in a terrible state at the moment.I believe in this republic and that we can find a way out of this.  We must not be afraid to take tough decisions to ensure our citizens have some hope for the future.  We should not give up or give in to a body such as the IMF.  Our sovereignty must mean something more than just an economic value.  We need to recreate the value systems or go back to previous value systems we had in this country and work in partnership with our European Union neighbours to look outwardly for some solution to the problems in which we find ourselves.  Now that the banking system has been brought into temporary public ownership it needs to go through a major overhaul.  The culture that exists, which has not changed since September 2008, must be revisited.  If the guarantee that was provided in 2008 has not changed the banking culture and people in the real economy are still suffering owing to lack of credit, then given that we have taken these banks into temporary public ownership we should do whatever we deem necessary on behalf of the people to ensure those banks are functioning as they should and we should make no apology for that.  We have been too deferential to the banking moguls here.I have searched the Statute Book to ascertain whether it would be possible to bring these guys out in handcuffs and do the perp walk as famously mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  I know a change in the Constitution and a change in law would be required to effect that.  How many of them have been arrested and brought before the courts for threatening the very sovereignty of the State?  The silver-haired foxes in the Department of Finance and those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House have left the people of my generation and the people of the generation to come after me with an albatross of debt around their necks.  Fianna Fáil politicians have the temerity to come out and attack the Labour Party.  What is patriotism?  They are not patriots and never were.  They are self-interested and always were.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I welcome the chance to say a few words in this debate.  Deputy Sherlock has probably summarised much of what we feel on this side of the House.  It is our age group that will suffer from all these decisions in the past two years culminating in this black Thursday or bleak Thursday or whatever one likes to call it.  It will affect those aged under 45 or 50 with large mortgages and other debts.  Everybody will suffer somewhat, but it will really affect our age group, our friends and colleagues, the people with whom we were in school and whom we represent.  They and their children will take the hit for this.I listened to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance suggest that it is all grand and is sorted now by spreading the cost over ten years.  However, it is not that simple; the country is now in massive debt.  The BBC news this morning claimed that Ireland was practically bankrupt.  It is all very fine to say it is all sorted out, nicely tucked away, hidden and parked for ten or 15 years.  As with NAMA the debt is parked to one side.  While there is some small hope that NAMA will get back some of its money, it will not make profit despite what the Minister claims; it cannot and will not make profit.  I hope still to be here in ten years' time when we find that out, but we, the taxpayers, will pay for it.Earlier I asked the Minister what will be the total net cost per year for the next ten or 15 years on the current annual budget of this.  I am not referring to the total amount given to bank bailouts; I know what that is.  I want to know the approximate cost to the nation of doing that because I know it is not as simple as applying 4% or 5% to the total bailout.  I ask the Minister to tell me and the people how much taxpayers' money will be spent every year before we get to invest any money in items such as social housing, parks, schools, hospitals etc.  They will all become of secondary importance because the debt will need to be paid for first.  It has not gone away and is not over today; it is just parked.  A big dark cloud will be left long after the Government is gone and most of its Ministers are finished in politics.  Instead it will be left to the rest of us to find ways to raise the moneys every year to pay it back.  I do not believe the Government has yet realised how serious this is or even feels the pain felt by many people.  Ministers do not live in the real world; most have not even probably driven a car in 14 years.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	672	Many of the Minister of State's colleagues are not in the real world or feel the pain of the people.  The Minister for Finance spoke about how anger is anger and will not fix anything.  People are angry because they believe the Government does not understand their pain.  People whom we all think had money are now under serious pressure and attend social welfare offices and community welfare officers nearly every day.  Many already know they will not have enough money for sufficient heating or food come Christmas time.  They must believe the Government understands their pain and point them in a direction out of it.They do not, however, buy into these bank plans.  The Minister for Finance speaks of turning corners.  If one takes four corners, one is back to where one started.  We have turned so many corners now, most people think we are back to where we started.  It is like the Minister is on a monopoly board, passing "Go" and picking up a few more billion euro each time.  Those billions happen to be taxpayers' money, however.  We are told the total cost for Anglo Irish Bank will be €34 billion which is more than a full year's tax take for this country.  That is like all the hard work going down the drain for a year.  It is so bad, people might as well have stayed at home for a year.I hope the Minister will grasp this and speak to the people with some understanding and respect rather than in the way he treats this House with total contempt and arrogance; that whatever he says is right and how dare we question him.I still have not got answers to the simple questions I asked at the beginning of this crisis.  For example, how was it the former Financial Regulator, Mr. Neary, told an Oireachtas committee that the banks' exposure to debt was €39.4 billion, when it was announced a few months later in the April 2009 mini-budget that it was €90 billion?  Those involved in all of this walked away with massive pay-outs and pensions.  Today, when the Minister was asked about severance packages for those in AIB, he said it has nothing to do with him.It has everything to do with the Minister.  After today, we will own AIB.  There must be some policy on severance packages rather than rewarding those who got us into this mess.  The perception outside of this House is that those who created this mess will be rewarded while others will be punished for the smallest transgression.  If this is not fixed, we will have serious problems.  We are fortunate the people are not as rebellious as they are in other countries.  If they were, we would not be able to raise the moneys on the bond markets.  As I have said already, if the Government does not start treating people properly, there will be rebellion on the streets.  It may even be worse than it is in other countries.  There is only so much the people can take.  It is time they were treated properly, told the truth and given a direction out of this crisis.I welcome the idea of a four-year plan for tackling the banking problems.  The people need to see this plan so they can make decisions.  Many people have money saved.  If we cannot give them the confidence to spend their savings, there will be more job losses in the wider economy.  There is also a duty to give those who have lost their jobs hope and a direction.  Last week's announcement of a job creation strategy was a rehash of other plans.  It does not wash any more.  Proper sectorial plans need to be set out showing the job creation potential of each sector.  Such a four-year plan will only be credible if all parties are involved in it.  If the Government wants to put forward such a plan that will be believed by the bond markets, it must have the backing of the House.The Minister claimed today this brings closure to the process of determining the level of State support for the banking sector.  It does not.  There are still question marks over Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA.  The sooner these are brought to a head the better.The Minister also claimed that since the announcement of the banking guarantee, the State has been required to stand behind the domestic banking sector to safeguard the financial system and economy.  It is time the banks stood behind the State and stopped treating business and personal customers shoddily.  I get calls from business people who are being harassed and abused by bank staff looking for a few euro in loan repayments while their overdrafts of €15,000 are pulled.  This is Mickey Mouse stuff compared to the billions of euro the banks owe.  This will have to stop.  Business people are doing their best to keep their businesses going and others employed.  The banks need to work with people, not abuse them.The Minister must consider a State-owned recovery bank to get more credit flowing by using some of the funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Mr. John Trethowan, head of the credit review office, agreed with me at an Oireachtas committee on this proposal.  The Minister stated he wants a banking system that is firmly focused on meeting the needs of the real economy.  While we are waiting for the domestic banking sector to come around to this, there is a need for a national recovery bank.  Billions of euro have been spent on bailing out the banks; it is time some billions were put into businesses to survive.Now that we have come to the final figures for the bank bail out, is it possible to turn our attention to a job stimulus plan?  The one announced during the week was a Mickey Mouse one which no one believes.Some proposals for businesses are quite simple and would cost nothing such as giving them professional advice on how to draw up, say, business plans.  Many small businesses will survive if they get assistance in financial management, legal affairs or employment law matters.  Other countries stepped up to the mark two years ago to provide this assistance while we cut the funding to enterprise boards which provided such mentoring schemes.

The Government must move forward with this project.  The site has been chosen following lengthy consultations on engineering logistics and health involving the Mater Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital and the children's hospitals.  All of that is now complete and the recommendation was made by a qualified group of people to go for the Mater Hospital option.That decision was taken some time ago.  The Minister should now outline the timescale for the planning, construction and delivery of the children's hospital.It is a long time since discussions took place on the upgrading of the children's hospitals.  Crumlin Hospital, Temple Street Hospital and St. James's Hospital have never had state-of-the-art facilities.  It is now more than 25 years since Temple Street Hospital was supposed to get a new facility in the grounds of the Mater Hospital and ten years since €400 million was put aside for that purpose.  Planning applications were prepared and millions of euro spent on plans for the relocation of the children's hospital in Temple Street.  Just as the tenders were about to be opened, the Minister for Health and Children put a stay on opening the tenders because the new given wisdom was that there should be a centralised national children's hospital.The proposal now is to bypass the normal planning application process and to go for the new process under the legislation that allows for structures to directly to An Bord Pleanála on the grounds of strategic importance.  There are some suggestions, however, that there could be further delays.We should be told when the planning application will be submitted, how long it will take, how long construction will take and what has happened to the €400 million specifically put aside and never drawn down for Temple Street Children's Hospital.  Is that now part of the €700 million that the existing national hospital will cost?There are not many good things about a recession but a possible advantage is that construction costs will be cheaper, allowing the Government to get a better deal.  This is the time to build.  When we consider the tenet of the 1916 Proclamation that the children of the nation should be cherished equally, this would be a good monument to have up and running before we begin the centenary celebrations for 1916.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The Government's priority is to provide the best standard of complex hospital care for children in Ireland.  To further that priority the Government is fully committed to the construction of the new national paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital site.  We are also committed to providing the associated ambulatory and urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital.  This is an essential part of the overall development.The new children's hospital will play a central role in an integrated network of paediatric services across Ireland.  Merging the three Dublin paediatric hospitals into a single hospital structure will ensure a critical mass of specialised skills to provide highly complex treatment and care to sick children.  It will also provide additional benefits for sub-specialisation and for developing campus-wide support services.  The three hospitals are already collaborating with the Mater Hospital to maximise the potential for appropriate sharing of services across the Mater campus.The Minister set up the national paediatric hospital development board in May 2007 to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new national children's hospital.  The board is making good progress in its work and that it is working intensively with the HSE to bring the project to fruition.  The integrated design team, appointed in October 2009, has now completed the concept designs for both the new children's hospital and the ambulatory and urgent care centre at Tallaght.The development board will shortly be applying for full planning permission for the hospital.  The planning process will go ahead under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, which will shortly be applied to major health infrastructural projects.  There have been some claims that using this new provision will slow down the planning process for the National Children's Hospital.  In fact, the Minister believes that it will help streamline the process, by a direct referral to An Bord Pleanála.  Without the new Act, the hospital would first have to go through the relevant local authorities.Clearly this is a major project, which we all want to put in place as soon as possible.  The national paediatric hospital development board estimates that, subject to planning permission, the construction of the hospital will be completed by the end of 2014.  The Minister has asked the development board and the HSE to ensure that the fit out and commissioning of the hospital takes place as soon as possible after this.The full development is a very positive step forward for paediatric care in Ireland.  The three existing children's hospitals in Dublin have been fully involved in the consultation process, as have all other relevant stakeholders, including children, their parents and academic institutions.  This type of consultation will help ensure that the best possible decisions are made as we seek to deliver an optimal paediatric service for Ireland.In preparation for the new hospital, the HSE has set up structures to coordinate and steer various aspects of this development working with the development board.  Within this structure the HSE is working with the three hospitals involved to ensure that all current resources are utilised in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  The Minister believes that significant cost savings are achievable if services and practices are more closely integrated, even before the building of a new paediatric hospital has been completed.An up-to-date model of care which has also been developed for use in the new paediatric hospital.  It is based on the delivery of contemporary healthcare and best practice standards for paediatric services.  It provides a clear vision and direction for the provision of services to meet the future healthcare needs of children and young people in Ireland.I am confident that we will meet our objective of providing a world class paediatric service for our children in the new national paediatric hospital.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I wish to raise the serious concerns surrounding the report produced last weekend regarding deficiencies in the foster care service in the Cork region.In 2009, HIQA announced it would inspect foster care services in four local areas in the HSE region, covering Cork city and county, north Lee and south Lee and north Cork and west Cork.  These four areas were selected because they share a managerial operation for the provision of foster care.  We have heard a lot in the media about children who are vulnerable and need a lot of care.  We need to know the services of the State are there to ensure their protection.  I acknowledge the report states that where services have been in contact with children, the results and outcomes are positive.   The results and outcomes are good.  The links with foster parents are there but there are serious deficiencies and gaps in the services.  From reading the report, it would appear that most of these gaps come about as a result of inadequate staff provision in terms of those working directly with children and those supervising the staff.  The report examined a sample of 48 children.  In September last year, 690 children were placed with 452 foster carers in these areas.  Some 36%, or 249, were placed with relative foster carers or family members and the balance, 64%, were placed with non-relatives.There are some alarming facts in the report.  At the beginning, HIQA was told that all children had been assigned a social worker.  However, during the inspection fieldwork it became evident to inspectors that all children in care did not have an assigned social worker and that the non-allocation of social workers related to vacant social worker posts.  This is particularly evident in the city areas of the north and south Lee of Cork city.  Some 452 carers were approved as carers and 48 of those had not been assessed by a link social worker.  Of the carers who had been officially approved, approximately 50 of them had not been properly assessed to ensure their suitability as carers.Of the 43 children who were inspected in the sample group, 28% did not have a care plan and social workers had not visited approximately 33% of them for several years.  These are very vulnerable children and we entrust their care to the HSE.  It is responsible for their care, safeguarding their protection and ensuring that the correct governance and management structures are in place.  There are numerous recommendations in the report.  Many of them could be delivered if there was adequate staffing in the region.  Does the embargo currently in place relate to those staffing posts?I commend HIQA on the report which has shone a light on the inadequacies in foster care services in this region.  I am sure we have come across the issue before and that it exists on a national basis, but I am particularly concerned with the results and outcome of the inspection into the Cork region.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I welcome the opportunity to reply to Deputy Clune.  In general, the HSE is required under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children and there are a number of procedures under which the HSE take children into care.  Foster care is the main source of alternative care provided by the HSE for children in care.  As of July 2010, there were 5,877 children in the care of the State, the vast majority of whom were in foster care, one third with relatives.  Government policy reflects the importance of the family and of a family setting for the overall well-being of children.HIQA was established by the Government in order to ensure that there would be higher standards and that those standards would be met by the providers of services, including the HSE.  HIQA has done an invaluable job in the various inspections and reports it has provided — I agree with Deputy Clune in that respect.  It has shone a light into corners that had not been illuminated for many years.  In September 2009, HIQA commenced an inspection of four areas in the Dublin north area.  Its report in July 2010 highlighted very serious deficits in two of those areas.  The deficits included the failure to provide an allocated social worker.  Where social workers were allocated, however, there were positive findings regarding care planning and in the main children were receiving a good standard of care by dedicated and committed foster careers.  The HSE submitted action plans to address all the issues raised.  The recommendations are being implemented now and I had a meeting with the HSE this morning at which we went through some of the action plans which are being prepared in respect of Dublin and the findings in regard to Cork.  Regular meetings have taken place between HIQA and the HSE since October 2009 to monitor and review progress.  Inspectors will undertake follow up inspections to ensure the recommendations have been implemented.There were calls during the week for a national audit of foster care.  In fact, it began in 2009.  The HSE undertook a national audit of compliance and published its report in May 2010.  The audit showed that the majority of children were in receipt of services which were fully compliant with legislation, standards and good practice.  However, in some areas children were not receiving an adequate statutory service.  From the HSE's audit, it would seem that the problems encountered in Dublin north east were the most serious.  An action plan is being implemented which will address the recommendations arising from the national audit.The Ryan report, which has been adopted by the Government, recommended the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers by the end of 2011.  The HSE has advised that 200 of these will be filled in the current year.  The latest available information, which I received this morning, is that 177 have been filled and contracts have issued and further 23 posts have been accepted and are being processed.  Some 54 of these posts are in the HSE Dublin north east area.  A total of 36 staff have already commenced with a further six due to take up their posts in October and the remainder scheduled to be in post by the end of 2010.On 27 September 2010 a report into four local health areas in HSE south, which Deputy Clune mentioned, was published by HIQA.  The inspection concludes that there was evidence of good practice, and while there are deficiencies, in most cases it is due to the absence of an allocated social worker or the failure to assess foster carers and the absence of a care plan.  However, national standards were met in regard to children having a positive sense of identity, maintaining contact with families and friends, and also children's rights.  As part of the inspection process, birth parents of children in foster care were consulted and all told inspectors that they believed their children were safe in their foster care placements.  Moreover, children told inspectors they had someone they could speak with if they had a worry or a concern.All of the children in the sample group of 43, of whom inspectors met 34, were placed in or near their local communities.  This facilitated maintaining friendships and continuity in school.  Inspectors also found that siblings were placed together.  In one instance, the inspector found that five siblings were placed with three general carers who were themselves related.  This arrangement allowed for ongoing and informal contact between the children in a normal family context.  Inspectors found that social workers showed a good awareness of the need for children to have contact with their parents and extended family and went to great lengths to ensure this occurred.This is not to say that standards were met in all areas.  There was a problem where the formal assessment of 48 of the 452 foster cares on the panel had not been concluded, as Deputy Clune pointed out.  It is important to say that an initial assessment, including Garda and medical checks, had occurred.  Inspectors also found that 25 of the 690 children in care did not at the time of the inspection have access to a social worker as their allocated social worker was on maternity or other leave.  To answer the Deputy's question on the recruitment moratorium, social workers are exempt from it but in addition HSE south will receive pro rata its relevant number of staff.  The HSE south has recently recruited new social workers.  A total of 54 of the social worker posts prioritised for 2010 were allocated to HSE south.  A total of 45 staff have already commenced employment with the remaining ten posts scheduled to be filled by the end of 2010.While I understand fully the need to identify and resolve the problems for children in foster care, it is also essential that recognition is given to the thousands of foster carers nationally who, on a daily basis, give love and care to children in need, and through the stability of their homes and lives help children to grow and develop with confidence and hope.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the good work across the majority of foster care services and to support the efforts of the HSE, foster carers and HIQA inspectors in striving to achieve the highest of standards in this area.  I also wish to put on the record the work done by the Irish Foster Carers Association and the Irish Association of Young People in Care in advocating on behalf of children in care and giving them a voice.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I would like to start off by paying tribute to the gardaí and civilians working in the Central Garda Vetting Unit.  They do a very important job and they do it extremely well.  The problem we have at the moment, though, is that essentially they are overwhelmed.  As a consequence of all the allegations of child abuse in recent years and the publicity rightly given to that area, far more bodies and groups are seeking the use of the vetting services.   The service is in place essentially to ensure a person who is in employment that involves day-to-day dealings with children is vetted.  Not only does this facility cover child care staff, social workers and teachers in schools, it also covers those working with children in a voluntary capacity, for example, in sports clubs.  It is now possible for swimming, soccer and Gaelic games coaches, for example, to be vetted by the Garda vetting unit.  There has been a substantial increase in the number of clubs and organisations using the service and in the number of people in respect of whom vetting is sought.  A total of 187,864 vetting applications were made in 2007, but that figure had increased to 246,194 by 2009.A number of people have contacted me to raise this issue.  Some of them were in a position to start jobs working with children but found that many weeks were passing while they waited for vetting procedures to be adopted.  I have spoken to people who are seeking to effect adoptions but are having to wait while the HSE works through the vetting process.  People who have offered to do voluntary work in sports clubs have found weeks passing into months without vetting being conducted.  It is quite extraordinary that, as I learned in response to a parliamentary question yesterday, as of this week there are 60,000 applicants whose vetting has not yet been completed.  It is deplorable.  We must provide a service that has the capacity to vet individuals within four weeks of vetting being sought.  I accept there will be exceptions in this regard.  If proper vetting is to be carried out on certain individuals, information may have to be sought from abroad.  In such circumstances, it may not be possible to meet the four-week timeframe.  Generally speaking, however, such a timeframe should be met in the cases of individuals who have spent their working lives in Ireland and are seeking full-time employment or offering to do voluntary work here.  The blockage that exists means people are remaining unemployed for longer than they need to.  As a result, the State is paying social welfare it does not need to pay and jobs that could be properly filled are not being filled.  There is a need to appreciate that the vetting unit has a positive impact and should be able to do its important job within a reasonable period.I understand that ten additional temporary staff have been recruited to the Garda vetting unit in recent weeks.  That has happened because an enormous number of people are waiting for their vetting applications to be addressed.  At no stage should the backlog of applicants have been allowed to reach 60,000.  It is an extraordinary number.  We have been informed that the average waiting time is 12 weeks, but that is simply not good enough.  I am aware that 380 vetting applications from the HSE were awaiting Garda clearance on 30 August last.  A number of them had been awaited for five months, since early 2010.  Some of those who are seeking vetting clearance to obtain employment in the HSE are the social workers who are needed in our dysfunctional child care services.  Such dysfunction is persisting not because of any fault of the staff of the vetting unit but because of the Government's failure to allow the Garda to recruit additional people in this area.It is important that I conclude by mentioning that a number of individuals whose assessments for inter-country adoptions have been completed — the HSE is waiting to furnish the assessment reports to the Adoption Board — are waiting for vetting clearance.  In many such cases, it is important that reports are sent to the board so it can make a declaration of suitability before 1 November next, when the Adoption Act 2010 will be commenced.  If these people do not get a declaration of suitability before that date, they might not be able to adopt in foreign countries where they have been involved in planning adoptions over the past three to four years.  It is of the utmost importance that vetting applications are dealt with, in general, within three to four weeks.  It is of particular importance for priority to be given over the next week or so to the cohort of individuals whose vetting the HSE is seeking to have completed for the purposes of overseas adoption.  If that does not happen, it will be impossible for the Adoption Board to deal with all the applications for declarations of suitability that will be required.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  I appreciate why Deputy Shatter has raised the matter.  All Members of the House will be aware of the current pressures on the Garda vetting service as a result of the increased numbers of applications it is receiving.  It may be helpful if I outline briefly the background to the system of Garda employment vetting that is in operation at present.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting to a large number of organisations which are registered with the Garda for this purpose and which employ or engage people in a paid or voluntary capacity for posts where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  The unit releases criminal history information in respect of a person to the prospective recruiting organisation in response to a written request for vetting from a registered organisation.  Such a request can only be made with the consent of the person in question.  It is important to emphasise that Garda vetting is just one element of the overall recruitment process.  A recruiting body or organisation should take a range of other factors into account when coming to a decision on a person's suitability.The Garda employment vetting service has undergone significant expansion in recent years.  This strategic expansion is taking place by means of a phased roll-out to an increasing number of organisations in the child and vulnerable adult care sectors.  The House will understand that this target group is and must remain the clear policy priority.  The Garda vetting unit has managed a significant growth in the number of vetting applications it receives to the point where it dealt with almost 250,000 applications last year, which represents an increase from 137,000 applications in 2006.  The Garda authorities anticipate that approximately 325,000 applications will be made this year.  Approximately 18,000 organisations, covering a wide range of health, educational, sporting and recreational sectors, receive vetting services from the Garda vetting unit.  The demand for vetting is growing constantly.  The Garda authorities deserve credit for achieving an expansion in the vetting service to bring it to its current levels.  Significant pressures are affecting the delivery of the service in the current conditions.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the Garda authorities are working together to address them.  The partnership approach the Garda authorities have adopted with the various organisations that avail of the service will help to ensure their vetting requirements can be addressed and the ongoing programme of expansion continued.The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year as a result of seasonal demands, which can cause the volume of applications from certain sectors to increase greatly.  In any individual case, additional time may be required to process a vetting application.  Clarification or further information may be required or other inquiries may need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  The Garda authorities indicate that the average processing time for valid applications received at the vetting unit may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to approximately 12 weeks at times when demand is especially high, as is the case at present.  The Garda central vetting unit has advised the registered organisations of the need to take the processing timeframe into account in their recruitment and selection processes.  A reasonably significant time period will always be required to process a vetting application, given the nature of the checks which are needed and the importance of ensuring the process is carried out thoroughly.  The Garda makes every effort to reduce this to the minimum period possible, consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.Responsibility for the deployment of Garda personnel is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, taking into account all his requirements.  From the outset of the expansion of the vetting service, significant additional resources have been deployed to the vetting unit.  A total of 88 personnel are assigned to the vetting unit, including six gardaí and 82 Garda civilian personnel, including ten additional temporary personnel who were recruited in recent months to help to deal with the high volume of applications.Taken in the aggregate, these figures represent a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the vetting unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of developing the Garda vetting service began in 2005.  That being said, the Minister and the Garda authorities are determined that as effective a vetting system as possible is provided.  In that context, the overall staffing arrangements at the vetting unit are under review at present in light of the increasing demands being made on the Garda vetting service by the registered organisations.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Often, Ministers send in somebody else to deal with issues of importance, and I take Adjournment matters seriously and as being important to my constituents.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important matter, namely the need for the Minister for Social Protection to resolve the impasse on the carer's allowance which is, it appears, being deliberately withheld in certain cases to meet cost-cutting targets through a broadening of the eligibility parameters set for those who provide full-time care and have done so for a number of years.While I do not want to point the finger at anyone in the administrative side of the Department as they merely follow orders, it appears to me that people who have given up a large part of their lives to look after elderly or infirm relatives, neighbours or friends are being very shabbily treated.  These selfless workers, who perform a valuable service for the community and the State by saving the cost of residential care or home nursing, fail to get reasonable acknowledgement for their work.  They are victims of cutbacks or deliberate stalling when it comes to payments.I read an interesting comment, which sums up the feeling of the ever-increasing number of those who for no discernible reason have been refused a carer's allowance, and that comment is that the recession demands nothing less.  Added to that could be the comment that the Government is a hard taskmaster when it is clawing back the money it squandered.We still have a health sector that is top heavy.  The excess layers remain, and will remain, untouched.  They are the ones the system protects, the ones who have a strong union presence behind them.  Not so the carers of this country; there is no protection for them.At present, an estimated 350,000 people provide paid or unpaid care to those who are unable to care for themselves.  A Central Statistics Office report on carers published in July this year shows that 8% of those over 15 in this country are providing unpaid care to dependent, disabled or chronically ill people.  This percentage has risen from 4.9%, or 161,000, in 2006.Interestingly, a Social Welfare Appeals Office report highlights that of the 25,963 appeals registered in 2009, 48% were decided in favour of the appellant.  This figure would indicate a lack of reasonable criteria being issued to front line staff or, worse still, a deliberate policy of refusal and delay.This worrying trend was recently highlighted by the Carers Association when addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Claims that would have been passed two years ago are now being refused.  The basis of these refusals is the health of the people receiving care, even if their doctor has signed off on their ill-health.It is particularly worrying that those coming off carer's benefit are being rejected for the allowance.  Carer's benefit is paid for up to two years to people who leave the workforce to care for a person full-time but what happens then?  If they are refused carer's allowance do they leave the person they are looking after without care or do they continue the care unpaid?  This is hardly practical.I am puzzled as to how the payment of a couple of hundred euro a week to a relative, friend or neighbour who is prepared to put his or her life on hold to look after an elderly parent or other person is not considered cost effective or efficient.  Irish people returning from abroad to look after elderly relatives are being refused a carer's allowance because of the habitual residency condition.  This is ridiculous and must be reviewed.With 4% taken from carers in last December's budget, it is frightening to think what a Government in hock to the tune of €50 billion to Irish banks will cut from the entitlements of the elderly and vulnerable and their carers in the forthcoming budget.  I urge the Minister to look at the broader picture and balance care for the carers with short-term gain for the Exchequer at the cost of fairness and transparency.  I would welcome a favourable reply from the Minister this evening.  When I see him here, I hope it is with good news.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	688	It is with very good news because, as Deputy Bannon knows, decisions made in the Department are made by deciding officers who act absolutely independently of me and if one is not happy with a decision one goes to a independent appeals office, so the allegation that in some way a directive on the application of the rules went from the top of the Department is utter nonsense and I assure the Deputy of that.If this country could not borrow money on international markets, the effect on the social welfare budget, which is 38% of the current spend, would be absolutely devastating.  The Government is focused on ensuring that we can borrow money to provide the top-class services we do through our social welfare system.I will now deal with the question on people transferring from carer's benefit to carer's allowance and I think Deputy Bannon knows how the schemes work.  Carer's benefit was introduced in October 2000.  It is a social contribution payment made to people who have left the workforce to look after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.To qualify for carer's benefit and carer's allowance, the person being cared for, namely, the caree, must require full-time care and attention.  A decision on medical eligibility is made based on the medical evidence supplied at the time of the relevant application.  A decision on medical eligibility would have been made at the time of an application for carer's benefit based on the medical evidence supplied.  When a person is no longer eligible for carer's benefit and subsequently applies for carer's allowance in respect of the same care recipient, a new application must be submitted.  The Department's medical assessor gives an opinion, based on the latest medical information supplied.  In a small number of cases, the assessor will advise that the caree no longer requires full-time care and attention.It is important to remember that the maximum time a person may receive carer's benefit is two years.  However, this may be spread out over a longer period with episodes of employment in between.  The medical circumstances can change over time.There is no difference in the medical eligibility criteria between the two schemes.  The medical evidence supplied by the claimant in support of the initial application for carer's benefit and the subsequent application for carer's allowance may differ and it is upon this medical evidence that the medical assessor's opinion is based.Practical experience as a constituency politician will tell one that often the reason an appeal succeeds is because the evidence given at the appeal is far more substantial than the evidence in the initial application, and we all know this.  A very small number of decisions, approximately 2%, are appealed so we are discussing 48% of 2%, which is 1%.  Removing the number of cases where if the information provided on appeal had been provided originally they would have succeeded leaves a very small number of social welfare applications where the basic decision is overturned by the appeals office.Claims for either carer's benefit or carer's allowance may be reviewed by the Department at any time to establish continuing eligibility and a claimant may be requested to furnish up to date medical evidence.  When applicants are refused carer's allowance on medical grounds they are notified of this decision, the reasons for it and their right of review or appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  I understand that there were a total of 78 cases in the year June 2009 to May 2010 which were refused carer's allowance on medical grounds following a carer's benefit claim.  Most of the schemes administered by the Department of Social Protection, including carer's benefit and carer's allowance, have qualifying conditions established by legislation.  There is no question of valid claims being deliberately withheld to meet cost-cutting targets.  While the economic situation is difficult, any changes to the qualifying conditions for carer's benefit and carer's allowance would require legislation and would only be introduced as part of the normal budgetary process.If one takes the figure of 80, or even 100, at an average of €10,000 a year, that would work out at approximately €1 million.  When one considers that my Department spends €200,000 a minute, that is the equivalent of a five-minute spend.  I assure Deputy Bannon that the numbers issues in my Department far exceed that and if anyone thinks there is some policy other than objectively examining every file on its merits, they are wrong.Deputy Bannon also raised the issue of the habitual residency claim.  I hear all this talk about Irish citizens but under EU law it would be illegal for us to differentiate between a Polish, French, British or Irish citizen or any citizen of any other part of the EU in terms of habitual residency, and that is the nub of the issue.  In making decisions on habitual residency, the fact that they are Irish as opposed to any other nationality cannot legally be taken into account.  As Deputy Bannon will be aware, the position is that people must have their centre of interest within this country.  I will give Deputy Bannon the figures, if the Acting Chairman allows me.  I am trying to be helpful to the Deputy.

To date in 2010, 139 out of 4,150 were refused.  Therefore, the numbers are relatively small.  It is a difficult issue and I have found as much myself.  The real challenge is that one cannot treat the citizens of any EU country differently and, therefore, the Irish person must be treated the same as a citizen of any other state.  It is also fair to say that one could not do away with the habitual residency condition because the consequences to our very good social security system would be horrendous.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The C&AG report states that the cumulative expenditure on consulting services for banking stabilisation services provided to the NTMA, Financial Regulator, Central Bank, the NPRFC and my Department was €33.76m.  Of this, my Department has spent a total of €9.78m in the period to end July 2010, €9.66m to Arthur Cox in respect of legal advice and €0.12m to PWC in respect of accounting advice.With regard to the hiring of Arthur Cox, this was consistent with public procurement guidelines contained in Circular 40/02.  Arthur Cox was chosen because of its acknowledged expertise in the field of commercial law and because its size allows it to dedicate sufficient resources to the project to ensure that advice is provided in a timely manner.  A good working relationship had also been established through Arthur Cox involvement with the Advisory Forum on Financial Legislation.  The Office of the Attorney General approved the selection in so far as their legal expertise is concerned on 24 September 2008.  In addition to the 8% Government discount which has been applied to all invoices, the Department negotiated a further discount with Arthur Cox.I am satisfied that my Department received value for money in the services provided by Arthur Cox and PWC. I would like to bring to the Deputy's attention that the Comptroller and Auditor General commented that the administrative costs incurred by State agencies in relation to banking stabilisation measures have been substantial in absolute terms but are small relative to the scale of the costs, financial commitments and risks associated with the banking stabilisation measures and access to timely and professional advice is a vital input to decision making in this context.With regard to enhancing the tendering services, the public tendering rules provide for exceptional arrangements in limited circumstances such as arose in procuring certain services when addressing the banking and financial crisis.  My Department will, of course, continue to observe both national and EU procurement rules.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The Financial Regulator on 30 March 2010 determined that EBS must raise additional equity capital of at least €875 million by the end of 2010 in order to meet the new base case capital standards.  The State provided EBS in May 2010 with €100 million of capital through the issuance of Special Investment Shares to secure EBS's immediate capital position.  These Special Investment Shares give the Minister for Finance effective economic control of EBS.  A Promissory Note to the value of €250 million was issued to EBS in June 2010 to enable it to meet its capital requirements as loans transfer to NAMA.The State has committed to meet the remaining capital requirement, to the extent that private capital is not forthcoming.  Expressions of interest in the Society were invited and a sale/investment process commenced in June 2010.  Interest in the society has since been expressed by a number of parties and proposals have been received.  These are being examined by my Department and the NTMA but it is too soon to anticipate any particular outcome.

To date, I have provided €2.7bn capital to INBS to cover the losses on lending by the Society.  Following a recommendation from the NTMA, I am providing, subject to European Commission approval, an additional €2.7bn, as a prudential estimate of the additional capital required to cover expected losses on the Society's remaining loan book.  This will bring the total amount of capital support to the Society from the State to €5.4bn.  This additional capital is being provided in order to establish a ceiling on the level of support provided to the Society consistent with the objective of providing final clarity on the public support required by the Irish banking system.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 141 together.I have indicated previously that I am examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions, to ensure the State has in place a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public moneys and ensuring continuity of key banking activities.In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions my Department is in consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with a view to the development of draft legislative proposals, which I will consider in due course.  This of course is a complex area where policy is still evolving internationally and I want to ensure that any model introduced in an Irish context meets best international practice.Work is also under way at the EU level in this area.  The European Commission is working to develop an EU framework for cross-border crisis management.  With the objective of ensuring that Member State authorities have the necessary common tools that can be used in a co-ordinated manner to allow prompt and legally robust actions in the case of bank failures, protecting the broader financial system, avoiding costs for taxpayer and ensuring a level playing field. Also included in the Commission's proposal for discussion are additional powers for supervisors to require the preparation by systemically important institutions of firm-specific contingency and resolution plans.  A Communication is expected from the Commission in October 2010, setting out the timetable, concrete measures and plans for an EU framework for crisis management with legislative proposals expected in Spring 2011. Ireland is, of course, participating fully in the work at EU level to examine possible elements of bank resolution tool-kits in a cross-border context. My proposals in this area, while not needing to await developments at EU level, will be informed by the debate and considerations in that forum.As I set out in my statement this morning, in addition to the work outlined above, my Department in conjunction with the Attorney General is working on resolution and reorganisation legislation, which will enable the implementation of reorganisation measures specific to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS which will address the issue of burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders.  The legislation will be consistent with the requirements for the measures to be recognised as a re-organisation under the relevant EU Directive in other EU Member States.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (the "Croke Park" Agreement) provides for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in the Health, Education, Non-Commercial State Sponsored Body (NCSSB), and Local Authority sectors.  In the context of the current constraints on the public finances and the need to maximise the use of resources, the public service needs the flexibility to be able to match staffing resources to areas of greatest priority. In practical terms the arrangements represent a means to sustain the ongoing delivery of priority services while other schemes and programmes are being reduced or downsized. The redeployment arrangements also support the commitment in the Agreement to avoid enforced redundancy.Redeployment of staff across the public service can provide Departments and agencies with an effective and efficient mechanism to reduce excess staff numbers and to acquire additional staff where appropriate, without the need to resort to outside recruitment.  For example, the increased staffing needs of the Department of Social Protection caused by the rise in the Live Register have been met within the existing resources of the Civil Service by the redeployment of some 450 staff from other Government Departments to that Department mainly by means of a staffing levy. Similarly, in the recent past some staff from BIM were redeployed to meet priority needs in SEAI.The Agreement makes provision for the redeployment of surplus staff with the initial focus on redeployment within sectors. As a result of the moratorium, natural turnover and additional turnover boosted by several factors such as the introduction of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) and the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme, public service numbers have already been reduced by 11,000 or 3.4% in the period since March 2009. Indeed, the sector for which I have direct responsibility, the civil service, has seen its numbers drop by 2,300 or 6% and is currently operating well below its end 2010 numbers ceiling. In light of these reductions in numbers, there has to date been little identified surplus to redeploy across the sectors. However, I envisage that the redeployment mechanisms outlined in the agreement will, going forward, contribute to a smooth transition to a public service operating with reduced numbers.Redeployment within employments or bodies in the individual sectors is a matter for the managers and employers in those sectors in the first instance having regard to policy and operational priorities and the budgets available.  Indeed this is acknowledged in the text of the Agreement.  Such internal changes in the assignment of staff and responsibilities are taking place on an ongoing basis in response to service delivery needs and reducing numbers of staff, and my Department could not realistically monitor such changes individually.

Unsecured senior bonds issued by Anglo Irish Bank before September 2008 do not therefore qualify as eligible liabilities, and they will no longer benefit from a guarantee after the expiry of the CIFS Scheme on 29 September 2010.Much has been said about senior debt obligations in Anglo Irish Bank. The position is that senior debt obligations rank equally with deposits and other creditors under Irish law. I have no plans to change this position. There is, therefore, no question of seeking to impose losses on holders of such senior debt in Anglo or indeed in any other credit institution in the State through any legislative measures. Any alternative strategy as advocated by some creates a significant risk of jeopardising the banking system's and indeed the State's access to international debt markets and cannot be countenanced on that basis.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I assume that the measure to which the Deputy refers is the Domicile Levy which I announced in Budget 2010 and introduced in Finance Act 2010.  The Deputy will be aware that the Domicile Levy of €200,000 is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose world-wide income exceeds €1m, whose Irish-located property is greater than €5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than €200,000.The Levy will be charged for 2010 and subsequent years, but the payment for each year can be made at any time up to 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  The first valuation date for the Domicile Levy will be 31 December 2010 and the tax return and payment of the Levy for 2010 will not be due until 31 October 2011.  No revenue will therefore be raised from the Domicile Levy in 2010.  At this stage, it is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue that may be raised from the Domicile Levy in 2011.  It is not possible to estimate the number of non-residents that this measure will affect.  Many non-resident individuals who file Irish tax returns are not Irish citizens or have a foreign domicile and therefore would not be subject to the Levy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	698	National accounts data published last week by the Central Statistics Office show that GDP declined by 1.2 per cent between the first and second quarters of this year.  I would point out that this follows an increase of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter — in other words, taken together the data for the first two quarters suggest that the level of GDP has stabilised.The quarterly figure for GNP was a decline of 0.3 per cent between the first and second quarters, pointing towards stabilisation in this measure of economic activity.  In annual terms, GDP fell by 1.8 per cent in the second quarter.  Personal consumption and investment moved in line with expectations while exports continued to increase significantly, which is to be welcomed.  However, a somewhat unexpected surge in imports reduced the overall level of GDP in the second quarter.  As I have already indicated, my Department is assessing all relevant information and will publish revised macro-economic forecasts in the coming weeks.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	699	On 30 March 2009, I directed the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Bank of Ireland and on 12 May 2009 I directed the Commission to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Allied Irish Banks plc (AIB). I gave these directions having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and having decided that the investments were required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system.These investments were in perpetual preference shares with an annual non-cumulative fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or, in the case of non-payment by either bank of the cash dividend, ordinary shares in lieu. The preference shares could be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of the issue and at 125% of face value thereafter. Warrants issued with, but detachable from, the preference shares gave an option to purchase up to 25% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of each bank (following exercise of the warrants). The warrants were exercisable at any time from the fifth to tenth anniversary of issue of the preference shares or immediately prior to any takeover or merger of the bank concerned, whichever is earlier. The number of ordinary shares which may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants was subject to anti-dilution protection in line with market norms for warrants. Accordingly, the warrants will be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of ordinary shares in issue resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of units of ordinary shares. The warrants will also be proportionately adjusted for any capital distributions by the bank and for certain bonus issues or rights issues by the bank.In February and May 2010 the Fund received ordinary shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB respectively in lieu of cash as payment of the first dividend on its preference share investments. The payment was made in the form of ordinary shares as the European Commission requested that discretionary coupon payments on Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments in Bank of Ireland and AIB not be paid while it considered each bank's restructuring plan. The number of shares issued in each case represented the amount of the annual preference share dividend divided by the average share price in the 30 trading days prior to the date of issue.On 25 April 2010, again having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and again having decided that it was required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system, I issued directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to convert part of its €3.5 billion holding of Bank of Ireland preference stock into ordinary stock as part of the capital raising exercise announced by the bank on 26 April. The details of the transaction are as follows:Placing/ Conversion (Step 1)The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) subscribed for 576 million units of ordinary stock. In exchange for this stock the NPRF converted 1,036 million units of preference stock at their issue price of €1.00 into ordinary stock. Warrant cancellation  The NPRF received €491 million in cash in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock.Rights Issue (Step 2)The NPRF participated in the Bank of Ireland rights issue taking up the full allocation to which it was entitled at a price of €0.55 per unit of ordinary stock.  In order to exercise the rights, the NPRF converted a further 627 million units of its preference stock into ordinary stock.FeesThe NPRF received €52 million in fees for its participation in the transaction.Change in dividend rate on preference stockThe dividend rate on the remaining preference stock increases from 8.00% to 10.25%.  The transaction involved no new investment by the NPRF in Bank of Ireland and was funded entirely via conversion of preference stock.  Including the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock and fees, the NPRF received total cash income of €543m from Bank of Ireland for participation in the transaction.The NPRF's directed investment in Bank of Ireland now consists of: 1,900 million units of ordinary stock valued at their current market price (36% of the bank's ordinary stock in issue); and 1,837 million units of preference stock held at their issue price of €1.00 paying an annual dividend of 10.25%.  The NPRF's directed investment in AIB now consists of: 3,500 million units of preference shares held at their issue price of €1.00 paying an annual dividend of8.00%.  198 million ordinary shares valued at their current market price (18% of the bank's ordinary stock in issue).The NPRF Commission will continue to publish information on the overall return on and value of the investments it holds at my direction in credit institutions in its quarterly Performance and Portfolio Updates.  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, in my statement on banking this morning, I announced the details whereby the NPRF will further support the recapitalisation of AIB as necessary. The details are set out in my reply to an earlier question today.

The latest mortgage arrears data from the Central Bank and Financial Regulator for period end June 2010 published on 1 September 2010 provide the following statistics for mortgage accounts in arrears more than 90 days and 180 days: 36,438 mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days of which 24,797 are in arrears for more than 180 days.  These figures do not equate to the actual number of homeowners in arrears.  This is because an estimated 20% of homeowners have two or more accounts, which are included in the figures reported by the Financial Regulator for period ended June 2010.  Examples of this are where the mortgage is divided into part-fixed and part-variable or where a second account was opened to cover spending on an extension.With regard to the second part of the question, it is a priority of the Government to ensure that as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is currently providing support for a number of initiatives designed to assist homeowners who are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by Money Advice Budgeting Service (MABS), which are all having a positive impact on the number of homeowners facing repossession.The Financial Regulator, who has responsibility for the CCMA, undertook a review, at my request, of the effectiveness of the moratorium period for legal repossessions in the CCMA and decided to extend the moratorium period from six to 12 months in line with my request. You will be aware that the 12 month moratorium came into effect on 17 February last and runs from the date the borrower fell into arrears.In addition to the above supports, the Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitments to Protecting the Family Home and Helping those in Debt under the Renewed Programme for Government, and of the appointment by me last February of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group (Expert Group) under the independent chair of Hugh Cooney, an insolvency accountant. The purpose of the Expert Group is to make recommendations to me on options for dealing with the growing problem of mortgage arrears and personal indebtedness.The Deputy will also be aware that the Expert Group submitted their Interim Report (www.finance.gov.ie ) to me on 5th July. In general the recommendations of the Expert Group's Interim Report are intended to improve communication between householders in arrears and their lenders; provide for a more consistent assessment process by lenders of borrowers in difficulty and introduce an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures. The recommendations have been accepted in full by the Government and action is being taken to bring them into effect. A consultation process on proposed amendments to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which will give effect to the recommendations of the Expert Group is currently under way by the Office of the Financial Regulator.The Expert Group has since commenced the second phase of their investigations and will consider how best to deal with the more complex issues facing borrowers in arrears. I expect to receive their final report by the end of October. The Government will then have an opportunity to consider the recommendations and decide on actions to be taken.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 71 together.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes was published in July 2009 and outlined 271 options with potential savings of up to €5.3 billion in a full year along with associated staffing reductions of over 17,300 in public service numbers.Following the publication of the Special Group's Report, which is advisory in nature, the Government referred the Report to each Government Department with instructions to examine recommendations relevant to their Department as a major input to the Estimates process for 2010.  In parallel with this, my Department also closely examined the Report for the same purpose.  Accordingly, the Special Group's analysis and recommendations were taken into account in the 2010 Budget and Estimates of Expenditure.  The formulation of policy in regard to the 2010 Estimates involved discussions and consultations between my Department and other Departments, as is normal.  Implementation of all Estimates decisions, including those arising from the Report of the Special Group, is the responsibility of the relevant Minister and Department.In summary, 41 recommendations have been implemented in full and 111 in part to date.  Detailed information in relation to the recommendations implemented may be sought from the relevant Ministers. In aggregate terms, the latest calculations are that these savings will yield in the region of €2.2 billion in 2010 and €2.36 billion in a full year, with savings implemented by the Department of Social Protection accounting for an estimated €730 million in 2010 and €780 million in a full year.  On that basis, aggregate savings outside of those related to the Department of Social Protection amount to approximately €1.47 billion in 2010 and €1.58 billion in a full year.  These figures include savings accrued as a result of the closing or merging of offices and staff reductions in specific areas.Overall, public service numbers have been reduced by 11,000 between end 2008 and end June 2010. This is due to a range of factors, including the moratorium on recruitment and promotion, the introduction of a new numbers control framework as recommended by the Special Group, and Government priorities in regard to public service provision. In addition, the Employment Control Frameworks agreed by Government will see the number employed in the public service reduced to 306,805 by the end of 2012. The latest figures reported to my Department show a reduction of approximately 4,400 posts in line with the recommendations of the Special Group. The majority of these posts are in the Health, Education, Revenue and the Defence sectors. Given the variety of factors that affect public service numbers policy, it is not possible to determine accurately the total reduction in public sector numbers associated with individual decisions taken to date.With regard to the rationalisation of public bodies, Departments have reported that 4 rationalisations of public bodies have been completed to date in line with recommendations of the Special Group. In addition, a number of decisions to rationalise further bodies have been taken in line with the recommendations and are in the process of been implemented. These rationalisation decisions are in addition to the 17 decision that have been implemented to date, in line with the Budget 2009 announcement on Agency Rationalisation, which have resulted in the rationalising of 23 Agencies and the closure of 4 Army Barracks. It is often difficult to make definitive savings projections when the functions of agencies and bodies are being transferred or consolidated.  Such matters only tend to become clear at, or shortly after, the commencement of the implementation phase.The Report of the Special Group will continue to be a central point of reference in the Government's ongoing consideration of overall expenditure strategy and structural reform across the public service.

If the request is unclear or is not a valid request the FOI officer will liaise with the requester and make every effort to provide assistance to the requester in an effort to agree an  amendment of the request so that it becomes a valid request and can be dealt with.The Freedom of Information Officer will issue an acknowledgment letter to the requester advising him or her of the name of the decision-maker, their contact details and the deadline by which a decision will issue.The Act sets out the procedures and time frames for dealing with requests and FOI decision makers and internal reviewers are obliged to comply with these. This is the same for all Government departments and every other public body covered by the Act.All decision makers and internal reviewers receive training in the operation of the Act and are familiar with its requirements.  Furthermore the Act sets out that it shall be the duty of a public body to give reasonable assistance to a person who is seeking a record under the Act (a) in relation to the making of the request under section 7 of the Act for access to the record and (b) if the person has a disability, so as to facilitate the exercise by the person of his or her rights under this Act.The Act also sets out under section 8(4) that in deciding whether to grant or refuse to grant a request under section 7(a) any reason that the requester gives for the request and (b) any belief or opinion of the head as to what are the reasons of the requester for the request shall be disregarded.Where a requester is unhappy with a decision whether wholly or in part in relation to the record concerned they have a right of appeal.  The first stage of this process is internal review which is set out under section 14 of the Act and this is where an officer senior to the original decision-maker will review the request and following such a review may as he or she considers appropriate, affirm or vary the decision or annul the decision and if appropriate make such decision in relation to the matter as he or she considers proper.If the requester is not satisfied with the decision on their request at internal review they then have a right of appeal to the independent Office of the Information Commissioner.  The Information Commissioner is independent in the performance of her functions.  The Commissioner may on application to her Office affirm or vary the decision or annul the decision and if appropriate, make such decision in relation to the matter concerned as she considers proper.  The decision of the Information Commissioner is legally binding.  A party to such a review may appeal to the High Court on a point of law from the decision. An appeal shall be initiated not later than 8 weeks after notice of the decision concerned was given to the person bringing the appeal.

These plans were reviewed by John Trethowan and the Department and were found to be credible.  Both Mr. Trethowan and the Department receive monthly progress reports from the two banks which allow us to ensure they deliver on the strong commitments given in their plans to support viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.Both banks insist that there are no constraints on lending bar demand from viable businesses.  To back this up, Mr. Trethowan has reported to the Department that both AIB and Bank of Ireland remain open for business and borrowers should use the Credit Review Office if they find this is not so.As part of the terms of the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland, the banks committed to actively promote mortgage lending at competitive rates, with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  In particular AIB and Bank of Ireland committed to providing an additional 30% capacity for mortgage lending to First Time Buyers. IBF statistics for all mainstream mortgage lenders show that overall mortgage lending to FTB fell by 25% in the full year to June 2010 vis-à-vis the previous comparable period.  In this market of retrenchment, AIB and Bank of Ireland continue to lend substantial monies and grow market share.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	704	Commissioner Semeta was in Dublin on Monday 20th September last to address a joint EU-USA conference for investigators and prosecutors on the subject of tobacco fraud which was organised by the European Anti-fraud Office and the Revenue Commissioners.In the margins of that conference I had a bilateral discussion with the Commissioner and his officials on EU tax policy issues including the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, CCCTB. The Commissioner confirmed his intention to bring forward a proposal to the Council of Ministers sometime in the New Year.For my part I reiterated our scepticism towards a CCCTB and said that while we are prepared to engage and work with the Commission in a positive manner in relation to tax matters, we would also uphold the principles that we and others believe in, in terms of subsidiarity, national discretion and competitiveness. I indicated to the Commissioner the need to analyse the likely impact of the CCCTB on employment and foreign direct investment in the EU. I also stated that the CCCTB could prove to be very divisive in that it could create significant winners and losers among Member States through the redistribution of tax bases.As part of our strategy on the CCCTB my officials are also in regular contact through our Embassy network with other Member States. We will have an opportunity for face to face discussions with our EU counterparts at a CCCTB workshop which has been organised by the Commission for 20th October next in Brussels. Furthermore, a new high level tax policy group, under the Chairmanship of Commissioner Semeta and to include representatives of all Member States is due to have its inaugural meeting next month at which we will have a further opportunity to engage with our EU counterparts on EU tax  policy issues.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	705	There is no doubt that the perceived uncertainty about the total cost of addressing the problems at Anglo Irish Bank has been cited as adversely impacting  on the cost of Sovereign borrowing and for Irish financial institutions generally. These total costs arise because of the appalling lending decisions by the bank prior to nationalisation and the losses incurred in that regard. It is not exposure to bondholders that is at issue. The bank's liabilities are to depositors including customers and the Central Bank, senior bondholders and subordinated bondholders.The Government's primary objective in dealing with Anglo Irish Bank has been to minimise the cost of this distressed bank to the Irish taxpayer. The Government decided in early September that the bank will be split into a funding bank and an asset recovery bank.  The Central Bank has determined and announced the appropriate levels of capital needed in both institutions. That announcement, along with my earlier statement on the restructuring of the bank will bring clarity to the markets regarding the amount of capital required by Anglo Irish Bank. In addition my statement earlier today in relation to all the financial institutions will help bring certainty to the market.With this clarity I would hope that the markets will reassess the position and that the rates for borrowing by the State and by Irish financial institutions will fall below current levels.The figures for the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and all other relevant information will be taken into consideration in revised forecasts which will be published in the Pre-Budget Outlook in October.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	706	The National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, Section 211(1) specifies that NAMA has recourse through the High Court in the event that a debtor has disposed of an eligible bank asset, in order to defeat, delay or hinder the acquisition by NAMA.I am informed by NAMA that it will take the appropriate action where it considers that this has occurred.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	707	As I indicated in my Statement earlier today much has been said about senior debt obligations in Anglo Irish Bank. The position is that senior debt obligations rank equally with deposits and other creditors under Irish law. I have no plans to change this position. There is, therefore, no question of seeking to impose losses on holders of such senior debt in Anglo or indeed in any other credit institution in the State through any legislative measures. Any alternative strategy as advocated by some creates a significant risk of jeopardising the banking system's and indeed the State's access to international debt markets and cannot be countenanced on that basis.The principle of appropriate burden sharing by holders of subordinated debt, however, is one with which I agree. As can be seen from the figures outlined above, the losses in the bank are substantial and it is right that the holders of Anglo's subordinated debt should share the costs which have arisen.In keeping with this approach, my Department in conjunction with the Attorney General is working on resolution and reorganisation legislation, which will enable the implementation of reorganisation measures specific to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS which will address the issue of burden-sharing by subordinated bondholders.  The legislation will be consistent with the requirements for the measures to be recognised as a re-organisation under the relevant EU Directive in other EU Member States.I expect the subordinated debt holders to make a significant contribution towards meeting the costs of Anglo.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	708	In April of this year following consultations with the Irish authorities, Eurostat published an estimated General Government Deficit for 2010 of €18.5 billion. At that stage the significant capital supports needed for the banks were not included as work was ongoing in that regard.Earlier today, I announced the final figures for the banks and I indicated that as a result of the supports needed, there would be a very substantial spike in our General Government Deficit for this year. On a purely headline basis our General Government Deficit for 2010 will be around €50 billion or 32% of GDP this year. Were it not for the once off spike we would have broadly met our budget deficit target, with an underlying deficit of about €18.75 billion or 11.9% of GDP.My officials are finalising the Maastricht Returns which are due to be submitted to Eurostat today, September 30th. The final figures will be published by Eurostat on October 22nd, as is usual.In terms of the headline deficit it is important to note that the effects of the supports to the banks on the General Government Balance is once-off and does not impact on the deficit in subsequent years.  No additional borrowing arises this year as a result of this capital support to our banks. Our ongoing cash funding requirements for these measures will be spread over more than ten years.  Funding the banks in such a manner lessens the immediate impact on the Exchequer. It is important to note that the Exchequer is fully funded through to the middle of next year.As said earlier, the underlying forecast deficit for 2010 is broadly on target at 11.9% of GDP. The slight difference between the latest forecast deficit and the figure published in April is due largely to technical factors, and the Government remains committed to achieving a General Government Deficit of below 3% of GDP by end 2014 as previously agreed.

The outcome of these contacts is a clearer understanding that the two systems are not comparable. In effect, we are dealing with "apples and oranges".  The major differences are:The QNHS is a sample survey and as such the numbers reported in the QNHS can be subject to variance and in particular this can affect the trends seen over time. The numbers produced by my Department are based on a fuller census and as such are not subject to such sampling variances;The QNHS sector categories (for Health, Education, Public Administration, etc.) include both private sector and public service staff, whereas my Department's figures report exclusively on the public service;The QNHS "public sector" numbers include Commercial State Bodies (CSB) whereas the numbers reported by my Department for the "public service" do not include staff from CSBs (whose staff are not subject to the moratorium on recruitment and promotion);In the case of the QNHS, persons in employment whether full-time or part-time are treated in the same way (i.e. counted as one employed person) in the estimation of the total number of persons employed. In contrast to this "headcount" basis, my Department reports numbers on a Whole Time Equivalent basis (WTE); andThe QNHS is a large survey (approximately 30,000 households each quarter) that relies on self-reporting by persons in employment of the economic sector in which they work and also whether they work in the public or private sector. The supplied sectoral detail is subsequently categorised into the harmonised European Classification of Economic Activity (known as NACE), while my Department uses an employer reporting basis to collect its numbers from all public service bodies that employ civil or other public servants.The Central Statistics Office have informed my Department that their survey indicates that public sector employees make up approximately 80% of the Education Sector, 60% of the Human Health and Social Work Activities Sector and 95% of the Public Administration and Defence Sector.  Applying these percentages to strip out the private sector element would reduce the gross total for these Sectors from 492,500 to approximately 363,000 on a "headcount" basis.The monitoring of public service numbers to verify compliance with Employment Control Frameworks will continue to use the systems set up by my Department.  The numbers reported to my Department for end-June 2010 were 308,370 (WTE), compared to 319,440 at end-December 2008.

The Commission was formally established on 21 September 2010 by Government Order.The person concerned will receive a per diem fee of €1,000 plus an allowance of €4,000 per month towards travel and accommodation expenses for the duration of the work of the Commission of Investigation, both of which will be subject to tax. The compensation arrangements in this case reflect an appropriate adjustment in line with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009.These compensation arrangements also reflect the fact that significant quasi-judicial powers are vested in statutory commissions of investigation established under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.

NAMA has completed a review of the assets securing the loans in Anglo's remaining NAMA tranches, taking into account its experience of valuing similar assets in the transfer of completed tranches.  This review has enabled NAMA to determine and advise the Central Bank of the expected discount of 67% on the remaining €19bn. of the bank's loans that are due to be transferred.

Note 14 to these accounts (page 75) provides details on the transaction, including a sales figure of €141m for the disposal and a profit of €49m. The note also indicates that the Bank provided the purchaser with a €24 million long term subordinated loan to part fund the purchase. A reference was also made to the transaction on page 59 of the Accounts (Segmental Reporting) and page 16 (Business Review).This sale obviously took place prior to the nationalisation of the bank. However, the bank has advised that the particular private banking business was not a core activity of the bank, was not particularly profitable and that there was a significant operational risk running the operation at a distance. The bank feels it important to point out that the bank did keep a branch in Austria. I am informed that there is nothing in the records of the bank or the nature or timing of the transaction to suggest that the sale of the subsidiary was other than the normal course of business.If the Deputy has any specific information which indicates further investigation is warranted she should of course bring this information to the attention of the appropriate authorities.

To date, no sites have been acquired to provide permanent accommodation for decentralising Offices at those locations nor have advance parties been put in place by the Departments and agencies concerned.

However, this decline follows an increase of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter — in other words, taken together the data for the first two quarters suggest that the level of GDP has stabilised.The quarterly figure for GNP was a decline of 0.3 per cent between the first and second quarters, pointing towards stabilisation in this measure of economic activity.As I've already indicated, my Department is assessing all relevant information and will publish revised macro-economic forecasts in the coming weeks.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows.Firstly, the Revenue Commissioners acknowledge that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes.  However, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2009 had not been taxed in Ireland.  It is important to emphasise that this estimate would include both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-border purchases. Based on an estimate of 14%, the loss of Excise duty to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 would be in the region of €200m.The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners for tackling this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU wide and international basis, ongoing review of  operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and internally to  intercept and seize the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.Revenue officials are located at all key ports and airports and they are focused on the interception and seizure of illicit products at the point of importation.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the retail level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, coordinating national blitz-style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.In recent years, Revenue has signed Memoranda of Understanding with two of the main cigarette manufacturers, ITL and JTI, to further cooperation in relation to the illicit tobacco trade.  In addition, Revenue meets regularly with the trade association representing the leading tobacco companies as well as the four major global manufacturers.The problem of tobacco smuggling is a global one and requires a very high level of international and inter-agency co-operation.  In this regard Revenue's Customs Service works very closely with their colleagues in An Garda Síochána on a multi-agency basis and with enforcement agencies throughout the EU and with OLAF, the EU Anti-Fraud agency.  This high level of co-operation has resulted in many successful detections of illicit products and in the prosecution of those responsible.Earlier this month the Revenue Commissioners together with the European Anti-Fraud Agency (OLAF) co-hosted a conference in Dublin on the illicit tobacco trade.  The conference, which was the first of its kind, brought investigators and prosecutors from all 27 member states together with their counterparts from law enforcement agencies from across the U.S.A.  The conference recognised that the problem of illicit tobacco was a global concern.Revenue's strategies in relation to the detection of tobacco-related offences are under continuous review.  For example, in July of this year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the sole purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs tobacco in the course of the two week period of the operation.This multi-faceted approach that Revenue has adopted has resulted in the seizure of 148m cigarettes and more than 2,400 kgs of tobacco to date this year.Follow-up investigations are also conducted with a view to identifying those responsible and instituting criminal proceedings where the necessary evidence has been obtained. In 2009 the Revenue Commissioners prosecuted 165 cases for various tobacco offences.My Department, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, regularly review the legislative framework.   For example, the penalties for tobacco offences were significantly increased in the Finance Act 2010 when the penalty for conviction on indictment increased from €12,695 to €126,950 or up to three times the duty paid value of the goods, whichever is the greater, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The position is that on 3 June the High Court granted the Joint Administrators permission to appoint advisers on any prospective sale of the company in question.As a consequence of this appointment, a summary note of the business was circulated by the advisers to all interested parties in early July in order to establish the level of interest in purchasing the company. On the basis of the replies received the advisers on behalf of the Joint Administrators issued an information memorandum (27 August) on the sale of the company to interested parties which set out a two stage process for selecting a purchaser.  The memorandum which represents the first stage required the submission of a non-binding indicative proposal by Friday 17 September. These are currently being examined.I understand that following evaluation by the advisers and the Joint Administrators of the above mentioned proposals, a limited number of prospective purchasers will be selected to participate in Phase II of the sale process.

The purpose in establishing the NPRF was to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.The Act provided for the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission. The Commission is solely responsible for the control, management and investment of the assets of the Fund (other than assets which the Minister for Finance has directed the Commission to invest in a listed credit institution under the provisions of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009) and for determining the investment strategy for the Fund in accordance with Fund investment policy. The Commission is required to invest the assets of the Fund so as to secure the optimal total financial return, having regard to the purpose of the Fund and the eventual requirements on the Fund to make payments to the Exchequer, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission. It is open to the Commission to invest in infrastructure projects by way of participation in a public-private partnership or by investment in infrastructure funds. The Commission would of course have to satisfy itself that the investment was in accordance with its investment mandate.As regards NPRF investment in Irish infrastructure, I understand that the NPRF Commission completed a scheduled review of the Fund's Strategic Asset Allocation earlier this year in which the target infrastructure allocation, which includes Irish infrastructure, was increased from 2% to 5%. Furthermore, I note that, in a letter to the Committee of Public Accounts in March of this year, the National Treasury Management Agency stated that infrastructure, as a long-term investment, is a natural asset class for the NPRF and that the NPRF is keen to access PPP investments where the risk/return characteristics satisfy its statutory commercial investment mandate. Moreover, I understand that recent changes to the tendering process for PPPs will facilitate NPRF involvement in PPPs and that a number of opportunities are currently being explored.In terms of investment in Ireland generally, the letter to the Committee of Public Accounts, referred to above, also stated that the NPRF is committed to supporting domestic investment where the investment terms satisfy its risk and return requirements. This commitment includes a particular focus on the venture capital sector and the NPRF has to date made a total commitment of €68 million to four Irish venture capital funds. In addition, the NPRF has been working closely with the Government and Enterprise Ireland on Innovation Fund Ireland.

The Bank has in place a series of controls to ensure loan security is adequately taken, held and is protected. The Bank also works with external legal advisers in this regard.

The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2010 was forecast to be of the order of €20 billion and developments so far are in line with this estimate. The Exchequer deficit at end-August was approximately €12.1 billion compared to €18.7 billion in the same period last year.Tax revenues were just under €1.9 billion or 9% below the corresponding period in 2009 but this was in line with expectations. In total, just over €18.9 billion in tax receipts were collected in the first eight months of the year, just 0.7% below profile. Three of the largest tax-heads — VAT, corporation tax and excise duties were slightly above target in the period to end-August. The fourth — income tax — was somewhat weaker than anticipated in the first eight months of the year although receipts were above target in both July and August. The Budget forecast that taxes would be 6% below the 2009 outturn. Developments in the year to date are consistent with this view.At end-August, total net voted expenditure, at some €29 billion, was just under €1.8 billion or 6% below the same period in 2009 demonstrating the impact of the expenditure control decisions taken by Government.  Net voted current expenditure was 0.8% above target at €26.4 billion and was 1.6% down year-on-year. Net voted capital expenditure at end-August, at €2.6 billion, was down some 34% year-on-year and was some 24% below target. A considerable portion of this shortfall is due to timing and operational issues and it is anticipated that capital expenditure will pick up over the remainder of the year.The Exchequer Returns for the period to end-September will be published by my Department on 4 October. At that stage, my Department will comment further on the likely end-year position.

In these meetings, the Body has concentrated on the implementation of the Agreement, including putting in place strong structures at sectoral level and seeking from public service management their action plans for the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement.The plans, due for submission this week, will form an initial template for the implementation of the terms of the sectoral agreements which form part of the overall Agreement and set out a clear agenda for change within each sector. It is intended that these action plans will develop in a dynamic way over the four year period of the Agreement, in the context of Government policy on budgetary and other matters.It is a matter for the Implementation Body to verify cost savings arising from the implementation of the Agreement, including any service delivery that may be provided on an outsourced basis under the terms of the Agreement.The Agreement precludes compulsory redundancy, save where exit provisions are in place at present.  This commitment was given by the Government on the  basis that the redeployment arrangements in the Agreement are utilised as an alternative to redundancy where staff have become surplus for whatever reason in order to fill vacancies that are approved for filling in accordance with Government policy.

Presently, it is envisaged that the European Parliament will vote on a compromise proposal on 18 October at its plenary meeting.  Ireland is working constructively in this negotiation process.By way of background, the proposed Directive has two main aims to establish a secure and harmonised EU framework for monitoring and supervising the risks that AIFMs pose to their investors, counterparties, other financial market participants and to financial stability; and to permit, subject to compliance to strict requirements, AIFMs to provide services and market their funds across the EU's internal market (the so-called "passport").AIFMs manage hedge funds and private equity funds as well as commodity funds, real estate funds and infrastructure funds. The proposal is essentially aimed at the managers of any investment fund not covered of the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities or UCITS Directive. Sovereign wealth funds are not included within the scope of the proposal.The proposal is part of the EU's efforts to reform the financial regulation environment in Europe aimed at ensuring that the recent economic and financial turmoil is not repeated.

This is an important support to the Irish banking system, facilitating its access to both short and longer term funding to help maintain the overall stability of the banking sector and complements the broad Government Strategy to restore fully the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.With regard to the situation beyond end 2010, my Department and the relevant state authorities along with the EU Commission will continue to monitor market developments over the coming months so as to confirm that the Guarantee continues to underpin the core principles of financial stability and funding access for the financial institutions. Approval for the continued provision of financial support under this Scheme must be sought from the European Commission every six months in accordance with EU State aid requirements.

A Steering Group and a number of working groups were established to carry out the necessary research.   I expect to see the Group's report shortly.On receipt of this report, and having considered its contents, I will then decide on the possible publication of a discussion paper on the issue.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	727	Consideration of how to ensure that the financial sector contributes to the cost of dealing with crises is underway in various fora internationally including the EU.  The European Council in June agreed that EU Member States should introduce systems of levies and taxes on financial institutions to ensure fair burden-sharing and to set incentives to contain systemic risk.  The Council called for careful assessment of the main features and issues of level playing field and cumulative impacts and invited the Council and the Commission to take this work forward and report back in October.The IMF report to the G20 in June analysed various options including a financial transaction tax and proposed two possible contributions from the financial sector: a Bank Levy, or "Financial Stability Contribution" levy (FSC), to pay for the fiscal cost of government support of the sector; and a tax on financial transactions which involved two options, a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), charged on financial transactions undertaken by financial institutions covering dealings by those institutions in stock, bonds and derivative transactions in exchanges as well as instruments traded "over the counter" rather than in a recognised exchange, but not transactions undertaken by individuals and businesses, or a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), a broader tax levied on the profits and remuneration of financial institutions, which is sometimes described as a form of VAT on financial institutions by targeting the ‘added value' of the services they provide (there is no VAT on financial services in the EU).In a May 2010 Communication, the European Commission supported the establishment of ex ante resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner and suggests that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework.  An objective of the Commission’s proposal, in conjunction with its wider proposals on a crisis management system, is to mitigate the burden on the taxpayer arising from financial crises.This is a complex area and careful consideration is being given at EU level to the issues involved. Ireland is of course participating in those deliberations.In my dealing with the banks, I have clearly maintained the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State's support — the banks have been charged for the Government's guarantee of their liabilities and the NAMA Act provides for a levy on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer.  In the context of the enhancement of supervision and the restructuring of the banking sector underway in Ireland it is my intention to ensure that the sector contributes its appropriate share, thereby minimising as much as possible taxpayers' exposure to potential costs arising from State support of the banking sector.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available on the cost to the Exchequer of all property related tax schemes is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the year 2008, the latest year for which this information is available. These are set out in the following table:Scheme2008€mUrban Renewal84.5Town Renewal23.7Seaside Resorts5.7Rural Renewal34.2Multi-storey car parks6.6Living over the Shop2.5Enterprise Areas2.5Park & Ride0.7Holiday Cottages10.8Hotels114.7Nursing Homes19.4Housing for the Elderly/Infirm3.0Hostels0.66Guest Houses0.11Convalescent Homes0.5Qualifying (Private) Hospitals12.3Qualifying Sports Injury Clinics1.5Buildings Used for Childcare Purposes12.0Mental Health Centres0.0Student Accommodation22.7Registered Caravan Parks0.6It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2008 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.Projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the projected cost data requested by the Deputy for the year 2010 in relation to the above-mentioned reliefs.

Such fees may reflect a variety of factors, including the price charged by the retailer's bank to offer laser card services.While I am conscious of the additional cost to consumers arising from such charges, I should point out that in the event that retailers were unable to reflect their own costs, they may choose not to accept payment using debit or credit cards. This could result in increased use of paper-based payment instruments, a development which would run counter to the Government's objective of encouraging the use of electronic payment methods.The Deputy may wish to be aware that, notwithstanding the above, the Consumer Protection Act 2007, which is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Minister Batt O'Keeffe, T.D, may apply in the scenario referred to in the question. The National Consumer Agency is statutorily responsible for enforcing the provisions of that Act and should be consulted for advice in relation to specific cases.

The most recent such report, to 30 June 2010, valued the Fund at €24.1 billion.The value of the discretionary portfolio (investments made under the Fund's investment policy and for which the Commission is responsible) was €17.3 billion as of 30 June 2010. The value of the investments in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc, made by the Fund at the direction of the Minister for Finance, was €6.8 billion at the same date. This latter figure does not include €491 million in cash received by the NPRF in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued by Bank of Ireland in conjunction with the preference stock. This warrant cancellation formed part of the NPRF's participation in the capital-raising exercise announced by Bank of Ireland on 26 April 2010. This receipt has been allocated to the Fund's discretionary portfolio.

However, because of changes in grading and organisational structures across the Civil Service in the intervening period between 2000 and 2009, these figures cannot be directly compared.  Excluding the equivalent grades, a more direct comparison would be that in 2000 there were 462 Principal Officers (Standard & Higher Scales) compared with 709 (Standard & Higher Scales) in 2009. This number has since declined to 682 in Summer 2010.As regards the wider public service, information of this nature had not been generally reported to my Department in the past as the focus had been on overall numbers.  Therefore, I am not in a position to provide any information in relation to 2000.  However, following the establishment of a new public service monitoring system during 2009, information along the lines sought by the Deputy has started to be reported to my Department.  They are mutual data only and I will communicate with the Deputy when the information is fully collated and analysed.

This was not unexpected, and a number of factors, including higher mortgage interest costs and base effects, contributed to the increase.The EU measure of consumer prices — the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) — remains in negative territory, with prices on this measure falling by 1.2 per cent in the year to August.  This compares with a positive annual rate in the euro area, and shows that our competitiveness is improving.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	734	On the 8th of September last I announced the Government's decision on the restructuring and resolution of Anglo Irish Bank, which remains subject to European Commission approval.This envisages the splitting of the bank into two licensed and regulated credit institutions: an Asset Recovery Bank focussed on recovering maximum value for the State from the loan assets and business of Anglo not being transferred to NAMA and a Funding Bank to fully safeguard Anglo's deposit base. It is important to note that this restructuring is not a cessation of business.As I indicated in my Statement the Central Bank has completed its assessment of the capital required by the new structure. A statement has been issued by the Central Bank which details the capital required in a base case and in a stressed scenario and provides an explanation of the approach and methodology adopted to determine the bank's capital requirements.The Central Bank has determined and advised the Bank that in the central — or expected loss case — an additional €6.4bn in total capital will be needed for the Recovery Bank and Funding Bank structure to continue to meet the minimum capital requirements in the coming years consistent with Basel rules.A total of €22.9bn has already been provided by the State since the bank was nationalised early in 2009. This additional capital requirement brings the projected total gross cost of the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank to €29.3bn.This additional capital will be provided by increasing the Promissory Note issued by the State and by appropriate burden-sharing exclusively by holders of Anglo subordinated debt instruments as outlined in my Statement.The Central Bank has also undertaken a stress test on Anglo building on the PCAR analysis carried out for the other banks earlier in the year. The Central Bank has determined that on the basis of severe stress assumptions — including a 70% discount on the remainder of Anglo's NAMA loans– the stress case level of losses in Anglo Irish Bank could potentially be €5bn. higher than in the expected case of €29.3bn.The stress case indicates the upper boundary of the level of losses. It does not represent the Central Bank's expectation of the likely outcome.The Government will therefore capitalise the new structure to the expected case requirement of €29.3 billion.It will be a priority for authorities to press ahead with the restructuring of the bank with a view to achieving the split of the bank early in 2011. I will continue close consultation with the European Commission and in particular with Commissioner Almunia with the aim of providing in the next month all elements necessary to bring the Commission's assessment of the restructuring plan to a positive conclusion. This should allow the matter to be settled through a formal Commission decision on a timely basis.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows.Firstly, the Revenue Commissioners acknowledge that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes.  However, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2009 had not been taxed in Ireland.  It is important to emphasise that this estimate would include both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-Border purchases. Based on an estimate of 14%, the loss of Excise duty to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 would be in the region of €200m.The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners for tackling this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU wide and international basis, ongoing review of  operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and internally to  intercept and seize the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.Revenue officials are located at all key ports and airports and they are focussed on the interception and seizure of illicit products at the point of importation.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the retail level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, coordinating national blitz-style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.In recent years, Revenue has signed Memoranda of Understanding with two of the main cigarette manufacturers, ITL and JTI, to further cooperation in relation to the illicit tobacco trade.  In addition, Revenue meets regularly with the trade association representing the leading tobacco companies as well as the four major global manufacturers.The problem of tobacco smuggling is a global one and requires a very high level of international and inter-agency co-operation.  In this regard Revenue's Customs Service works very closely with their colleagues in An Garda Síochána on a multi-agency basis and with enforcement agencies throughout the EU and with OLAF, the EU Anti-Fraud agency.  This high level of co-operation has resulted in many successful detections of illicit products and in the prosecution of those responsible.Earlier this month the Revenue Commissioners together with the European Anti-Fraud Agency (OLAF) co-hosted a conference in Dublin on the illicit tobacco trade.  The conference, which was the first of its kind, brought investigators and prosecutors from all 27 member states together with their counterparts from law enforcement agencies from across the U.S.A.  The conference recognised that the problem of illicit tobacco was a global concern.Revenue's strategies in relation to the detection of tobacco-related offences are under continuous review.  For example, in July of this year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the sole purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs tobacco in the course of the two week period of the operation.This multi-faceted approach that Revenue has adopted has resulted in the seizure of 148m cigarettes and more than 2,400 kgs of tobacco to date this year.Follow-up investigations are also conducted with a view to identifying those responsible and instituting criminal proceedings where the necessary evidence has been obtained. In 2009 the Revenue Commissioners prosecuted 165 cases for various tobacco offences.My Department, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, regularly reviews the legislative framework.   For example, the penalties for tobacco offences were significantly increased in the Finance Act 2010 when the penalty for conviction on indictment increased from €12,695 to €126,950 or up to three times the duty paid value of the goods, whichever is the greater, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.

It is estimated that in 2010, approximately 45% of income earners will be exempt from tax and 42% of income earners will pay tax at the standard rate.  I consider that this shift in the income tax burden is unsustainable and the income tax base needs to be widened.As I also stated in Budget 2010, with a view to restoring balance in the income tax system, to simplify it, to make it fairer and more broadly based, I intended introducing a new universal social charge that would be paid by everyone at a low rate on a wide base.With regard to the introduction of a third rate of tax for those with high incomes, the position is that the Irish taxation system already has provisions that apply to such individuals with high incomes viz. the 5% health levy rate on income over €75,036 per annum and the 6% income levy rate on income over €174,980 per annum.   In fact, in 2008 the top marginal rates for PAYE employees and the self-employed were 43.5% and 46.5% respectively. Today the top marginal rates are 52% and 55%.As you will appreciate, it is a long standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

All these impacts have been factored into fiscal projections.Recently released figures from the CSO show that net outward migration in the year to April 2010 was minus 34,500. Additionally, it should be noted that the natural increase in the population is at its highest rate since at least 1987, which is an encouraging pointer to the overall sustainability of the Irish economy over the longer term.My Department will provide revised macro-economic forecasts in the Pre-Budget Outlook in October.

The application of this protection to the records of meetings on 29/30 September was upheld by the Information Commissioner in her decision of 22 January 2010 (Case 090028). The Information Commissioner's published decision indicates that she was satisfied the primary purpose of the information exchanged at the meetings was for the conducting of an incorporeal meeting of the Government held on 30 September 2008. On that basis the Commissioner decided that the records were prohibited from release under section 19(1) (c) of the Freedom of Information Act.It is public knowledge that in meetings held over the course of 29 September and into the early hours of 30 September the appropriate response to the difficulties facing Irish banks was discussed. As well as the Taoiseach and myself, these meetings also involved the Attorney General, the Governor and Director General of the Central Bank, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Regulator, senior officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and the NTMA, legal advisors and the Chairmen and CEOs of AIB and Bank of Ireland.Regarding the solvency position of Anglo Irish Bank, I would note that the focus of the discussions on 29 September was on dealing with the severe liquidity difficulties facing the banks. Detailed information regarding the capital position of the banks, including Anglo Irish Bank, such as the PwC reports subsequently completed and published, was not available at that time and while it was clear that Anglo was experiencing difficulties, the extent of Anglo's capital problem was not evident at that time.

If necessary, the NPRFC's underwriting commitment will be met by the conversion of up to €1.7bn of the State's existing preference shareholding and the investment of the NPRFC's cash balance.In the event that the bank's residual capital requirement is not met through asset disposals, it may be met from a subsequent conversion of the remaining €1.8bn. preference shares to the extent that this may prove necessary.

Central to the Experts Group’s terms of reference is a requirement to make recommendations to me on options for improving the current situation for families with mortgage arrears and personal debt.The Expert Group has completed the first phase of its work and submitted an Interim Report to me in July www.finance.gov.ie. The Interim Report's key recommendations address the issues of communication between householders in arrears and their lenders, and the need for a more consistent assessment process by lenders of borrowers in difficulty in the form of an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures.  The recommendations have been accepted in full by the Government and action is being taken to bring them into effect.The Expert Group is now in the process of addressing the more complex issues of homeowners who are facing long term difficulties in meeting their mortgage and personal debt commitments and will make recommendations to me at the end of next month which will build on the Interim Report's recommendations to provide an integrated package of solutions to address the various circumstances that borrowers are now finding themselves in.As has been stated on many occasions in this House, it is a priority of the Government to ensure as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  I am confident that the support measures being taken by Government, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by MABS, are having a positive effect in this regard. However, I will await the final recommendations of the Expert Group before deciding on options for improving existing supports.

Therefore, all the Government's actions in the banking area are designed to support the development of a reformed and reinvigorated banking system that can serve our economy in a proper manner and, within which, there is scope for all viable credit institutions operating in the Irish market to play their full part.  The State has taken over institutions in distress to protect the financial stability of the banking system.  Financial institutions, with the help of the State, are seeking to ensure they meet the required capital needs which should lead to stable financial institutions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has advised that, as is usual, the estimates for debt servicing costs in the Stability Programme Update were prepared on the basis of the market conditions for Irish Government bonds prevailing at the time of the preparation of the Budget.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, the NTMA does not disclose the assumptions underlying the estimates.The funding requirement for 2010 was some €20 billion.  The NTMA estimate that a 100 basis point increase in rates would lead to an increase cost of €200 million for a full year.  However as a result of the NTMA's policy of locking in long-term funding at historically low rates over the last number of years, over 95% of the debt now outstanding carries fixed rates of interest.  With the September auction, the NTMA achieved its target of raising €20 billion in long-term funding from the bond markets in 2010.  This funding is fixed at a weighted average cost of 4.7% which is the same as the average cost achieved in 2009.

This specialist has a Bachelor of Commerce degree, and also a Masters in Economic Science.  In addition, my Department has recently secured the services (since 1 March 2010) of a banking accountant for a period of 12 months through an agreed secondment arrangement, at no cost to my Department.  He has a B. Comm degree, and is also a qualified accountant.  The Department has also engaged, on secondment from the Office of the Attorney General, a Senior Legal Advisor to the Department solely on financial services matters.  The Legal Advisor has Bachelor of Civil Law and Barrister at Law degrees, and in addition to his experience in the Office of the Attorney General, he spent a number of years as a barrister in private practice.  Finally, in July last, the Government approved the appointment of a Senior Economist on a 3 year employment contract.Since 2008, the staffing levels in the Financial Services Division  of my Department  within which responsibility for banking lies, have increased from 34.20 to 51.73 (whole time  equivalents) in 2010 — a 51.5% increase.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, I have looked at my overall resources on banking and have reallocated considerable functions to the NTMA, which has also engaged a number of new banking experts for this purpose.  Overall, therefore, my resources in relation to the banking area, including specialist expertise, have increased significantly, and will be kept under review.

Ireland remains fully committed to reducing our deficit to below 3% of GDP by end-2014.  It is important that we have a credible path to show how we propose to meet this commitment.  Accordingly, work is underway on a four-year plan that will set out the annual measures required to restore order to the public finances and bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by end-2014.  The four-year plan will be published in early November taking account of the latest economic and fiscal data.In order to fully underline the strength of our resolve, we will make a significant consolidation effort in 2011.  As part of the four year plan we will be incorporating, at a sectoral level, additional measures which will assist the strategy for recovery and jobs being pursued by the Government.  As stated by the Taoiseach this week at the launch of Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, jobs are the central priority of Government policy.  The focus of all in Government is firmly fixed on improving the fiscal and economic position and at the same time on ensuring that, as far as possible, we protect the economy and generate employment.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The recent release of the Quarterly National Household Survey for the second quarter of this year provided further evidence of the stabilisation of the labour market.  The year-on-year decline in employment in the second quarter of 2010, while unwelcome, was not unexpected.  It was, it should be noted, the smallest annual decline in employment since Q3 2008.  Last week's Quarterly National Household Survey release shows that there was a small quarter-on-quarter increase in employment in the second quarter of 2010.  Although seasonal factors account for this upturn, nevertheless, the trend is encouraging.This Government is particularly concerned at the growing rate of long-term unemployed.  Upskilling and retraining this group, in particular, will continue to be a priority for this Government, while schemes, such as the PRSI job incentive scheme for employers, continue to focus on creating new jobs for people who have been unemployed for six months or more.  The recent employment data highlight the considerable work that still needs to be done.  This Government will continue to focus on improving our price and labour cost competitiveness which is a necessary condition for improving the labour market.  Ireland's participation rate eased to 61.1 per cent in Q2 2010, in part, due to unemployed people returning to the education system.  It should be noted that in Q1 2010, Ireland's participation rate was still significantly higher than the EU or euro area averages.Separately, the CSO also recently released its Population and Migration Estimates for April 2010.  Gross outward migration in the year to April 2010 was virtually unchanged from last year.  The high level of net outward migration recorded is due to a sharp fall in inward migration.  Additionally, it should be noted that the natural increase in the population is at its highest rate since at least 1987, which is an encouraging pointer to the overall sustainability of the Irish economy over the longer term.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The latest estimate for the gross accrued liability for public service occupational pensions is €116bn as of December 2009.  This estimate is set out in the recent annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This figure was arrived at on the basis of a detailed actuarial valuation of public service schemes in the light of present terms and conditions.  The valuation followed the approach set out in the new accounting standard issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board, IPSAS 25.This accrued liability figure of €116bn is a single monetary amount representing the present value of all expected future superannuation payments to current staff and their spouses in respect of service to date, plus the full liability for all future payments to current pensioners and to their spouses.  The large size of the figure is due to the fact that it represents a projection of aggregate pension payments that will be spread over perhaps 70 years into the future.The estimate of the accrued liability should not be confused with the actual cash funding that will be required in the future.  The more meaningful measure of public service pension costs is the actual annual gross outgo on pensions which amounted to 1.6% of GNP in 2009.  Based on the C&AG Report in 2008 this outgo is projected to rise to 3.9% of GNP by 2058.  The projected increase arises from the growth in public service employment in the past and from increasing longevity.In Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a new single pension scheme for all new entrants to the public service — the new scheme will [a] raise the minimum pension age to 66 years initially and then link it to the changes in the state pension outlined in the National Pension Framework, [b] set a maximum retirement age of 70 years, and [c] provide for pensions on a ‘career average' rather than a final salary basis as at present.  The new scheme will provide reasonable pensions for staff in their retirement, while at the same time ensuring substantial longer-term expenditure savings.Following the ‘Croke Park Agreement' [Public Sector Agreement 2010-2014] and the clarifications provided by the Government on pensions and other issues, work is underway on the necessary legislation for the new scheme.  The Minister intends to present the draft Bill to the Government for a final decision on publication before the end of the year.  Subject to approval by the Oireachtas, the scheme will be in place for new entrant employees in 2011.

The scheme was introduced in 2004 and provides for a tax credit of 25% of the increase in expenditure incurred by a company on R&D as compared to its expenditure in a base year which is 2003.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional or incremental R&D spend by companies.  For companies who commenced to incur expenditure on R&D after 2003, the base year expenditure is nil and all of its R&D expenditure will qualify for the 25% credit.The Taskforce's recommendation in this area would involve an additional "deadweight" cost to the Exchequer in respect of R&D expenditure that had been incurred without the need for a fiscal stimulus. Indeed this fact is acknowledged in the Report.  It is my strong view that implementing this recommendation would represent poor value for public expenditure, particularly in the current economic environment.  Accordingly, I have no plans to review the incremental expenditure requirement for the scheme, given the obvious deadweight costs involved.

Restoring sustainability to the public finances is essential to underpin future economic growth.  My Department will continue to assess the most up to date economic and fiscal data and its implications for the fiscal consolidation process in the coming years as it prepares the four year plan.  An adjustment above the €3 billion will be required next year but it would be premature for me to get into details today about the extent of the additional consolidation required or its broad composition as between adjustments in capital or current spending or taxation measures.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	752	A healthy banking system is vital to the functioning of the economy and the Irish Government is fully committed to a strategy of restoring fully the Irish banking system.  Much progress has been made to date: NAMA has been established and the first tranches of loans have been transferred, restructuring or viability plans have been prepared for all of the guaranteed institutions and plans have been put in place to restore the capital positions of those institutions by the end of this year to levels at which they can withstand future losses, even under very stressed conditions.The restoration of the banking sector to health and the promotion of economic growth are interlinked, and the steps we are taking are intended to ensure that the Irish banks will be in a position to make a strong contribution to overall economic recovery.  Indeed, the two largest banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, each have committed to make available not less than €3 billion each year in new or increased credit facilities to SMEs for the next two years.  They have submitted their lending plans to the Department of Finance and the Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan.  Mr Trethowan, an experienced banker, has examined these plans and considers that they are credible basis for delivering on their commitments to support viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The Central Bank yesterday announced that it has advised the Irish banks that have been subject to Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) that the year-end deadline for meeting the PCAR standards remains in place despite recent developments in international capital standards.  The Central Bank also advised the banks as to the capital treatment of any adverse development in NAMA haircuts since the PCAR calculations were initially conducted on 30 March.Since the initial PCAR calculations on 30 March 2010, the completion of the first two tranches of NAMA loan transfers enabled the Agency to refine its estimates of the discounts on the remaining loans to be transferred to a high level of accuracy.  This allowed the Financial Regulator to update his assessments of the capital position of all of the guaranteed institutions following the earlier PCAR and the EU-wide CEBS Stress Testing Exercise carried out in July.  This has been achieved by the Financial Regulator working very closely with my officials, NAMA and the other relevant authorities, and with the participating institutions to establish as definitively as possible the level of capital required by them.In my comprehensive banking statement earlier today, I set out with clarity and certainty the final costs to the State of repairing the banking system.  Though significant, the costs are fully manageable in the context of the programme of fiscal restraint to which the Government is committed.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	754	While the rate of capital spending is a matter for individual Ministers, I am informed that the underspend so far is due essentially to timing issues and better value for money from lower prices.  There is no deliberate policy of delaying of spending to minimise the year end Exchequer deficit.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	755	As the Deputy will be aware I have instructed Anglo Irish Bank to prepare, in conjunction with the NTMA, the Central Bank/Financial Regulator and my Department, a detailed plan to reflect the restructuring approach decided by Government.  Work is continuing on this plan which will address in detail the respective roles and operations of the Asset Recovery Bank and the Funding bank.  When this task is finalised it will be possible to quantify the management and staff numbers and skill sets required for each entity.Until this work is completed it is not possible to indicate who will head up the institutions or what staff levels or skill base will be required.  In general terms however I can say that staff and remuneration levels will reflect industry norms.  For senior management posts, including Chief Executive Positions, remuneration will be in line with the recommendations of the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC).Finally, I think it is important that the public interest is specifically represented on the boards of institutions in receipt of State assistance.  Anglo Irish Bank is somewhat different in that the Bank is a wholly owned commercial State entity and as such I will insist in my role as sole shareholder that the public interest is to the forefront of the Board's objectives.

The figures refer to the exemption from the study of Irish in a recognised school and not to the examination itself.The choice of subjects for post-primary students, including those for students with an exemption from the study of Irish, is a matter for the student and his or her parents in consultation with the school Principal in the context of the students overall educational needs and in accordance with policies and procedures obtaining in the school.The State Examinations Commission has responsibility for the operation of the certificate examinations and publishes the results on its website at www.examinations.ie.  It is not possible for data protection reasons to match holders of exemptions with performance and subject choice in the examinations.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise  known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, is not attending a post primary centre within his catchment area and should contact his local Bus Éireann office regarding the availability of catchment boundary transport.

Once the stage 2(a) is approved the design team will be authorised to seek planning permission, fire certificate and Disability Access Certificate (DAC). These all form part of stage 2(b) of architectural planning. Once these statutory approvals have been secured, the school and it's design team will be requested to indicate a timeframe for completion and submission of the stage 2(b) report to my Department.The further progression of this project through to construction stage will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2011 and subsequent years. However, pending receipt of the necessary statutory approvals and in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give a more indicative timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	791	The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700 pupils by the year 2016. Meeting this level of significant increased demand for education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017. Overall post-primary requirements in the North Kildare area, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary school will be considered in this context.A multi-million Euro building project has been provided for Coláiste Cois  Liffe, Lucan to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 600 pupils.  This  Gaelcholaiste, under the aegis of Co. Dublin VEC was built to serve the needs of the west Dublin /north Kildare area, including Maynooth and Kilcock.  The enrolment for 2009/10 in Coláiste Cois Life was 345 and therefore this school would appear to have capacity to cater for the North Kildare area.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The NAMA Board set this date as 30 November 2009. It follows that any property price changes after 30 November 2009 will not be reflected in the NAMA market valuations. Commercial property price indices suggest that prices in Ireland may have experienced a small decline since November 2009 but prices in the UK, which has about one-third of the assets underlying the NAMA loan portfolio, rose by a greater percentage.It should be noted that, at this early stage, NAMA has taken over only the loans of the largest borrowers and has not realised any underlying securities and so it has not acquired any properties.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	794	On 30 March this year, in the context of the capital requirements imposed on the banks by the Financial Regulator and the transfer of eligible loans to NAMA at a discount, I made it clear that, insofar as any capital requirements could not be sourced privately, the Government would make up the shortfall.In my comprehensive banking statement earlier today, I set out with clarity and certainty the final costs to the State of repairing the banking system. Though significant, the costs are fully manageable in the context of the programme of fiscal restraint to which the Government is committed.The transparency and certainty to which we are committed have been recognised internationally as a significant strength of the government's strategy for the repair and the restoration of the banking system. The decisions we have taken will enable the banking system to play its essential role in providing the finance required to underpin our economic recovery and fiscal sustainability in the future.Furthermore, we now have in place a more stringent regulatory system overseen by the Central Bank Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan and the new Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield. The new fully integrated structure replacing the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland has been established by the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. With the commencement of the Act, the Central Bank will be responsible for maintaining the stability of the financial system, the effective regulation of financial institutions and markets and safeguarding the interests of consumers and investors.

The only recapitalised banks which are significant lenders to the SME sector are AIB and Bank of Ireland.As you are aware, on foot of the bank recapitalisations previously announced, I imposed specific lending targets on the two main business banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They are making available for targeted lending not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  The two banks have each submitted SME lending plans both by geography and sector for 2010 and 2011 and these plans are being reviewed by my officials and Mr. John Trethowan, the Credit Reviewer.A monitoring/reporting structure has been put in place which will ensure that banks continue to lend to the real economy and the Credit Review Office is operational.  This ensures that there is a process in place to review decisions by the participating banks where credit facilities are refused, reduced or withdrawn.

Both Mr. John Trethowan and my Department receive monthly progress reports from the two banks which allow us to ensure they deliver on the strong commitments given in their €3bn lending plans to support viable businesses in all sectors of the economy and in every area of the country.  There are also regular meetings to discuss the quarterly recapitalisation reports which cover the customer package agreed in February 2009.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	797	A total of €22.9 billion has already been provided by the State to support Anglo Irish Bank since the bank was nationalised early in 2009. The additional €6.4 billion announced earlier today brings the projected total cost of the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank to €29.3bn in the base case scenario that I announced today.In the case of Irish Nationwide Building Society, the National Treasury Management Agency have recommended that I provide a further €2.7bn representing a prudent estimate of the capital required to cover expected losses on the institution's residual loan book and bringing the total capital support to the institution to €5.4bn.€3.5 billion each has already been invested in both Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  The Financial Regulator has confirmed that Bank of Ireland has sufficient capital to meet the PCAR standard.In the case of Allied Irish Banks additional capital of up to €7.9 billion will be required. Of this amount, €5.4bn is to be raised through a placing and open offer to shareholders underwritten by the NPRFC using, if necessary the conversion of up to €1.7bn of the State existing preference shareholding and the use of the NPRFC's cash balance to make up any remaining shortfall.  The balance, €2.5bn, will be made up through the sale of AIB's stake in M&T Bank and disposal of other assets in due course. Any residual capital requirement may be met from a subsequent conversion of the remaining preference shares to the extent that this may prove necessary.The Educational Building Society has to date received €350 million.  The Society is in discussion with a number of parties about its future and any adjustment in its capital need that arises will be accommodated in the outcome of those discussions in due course.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	798	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that all processing of personal information by Revenue is carried out in accordance with Data Protection legislation.  A general principle of Irish Data Protection law is that a data controller needs the consent of the data subject in order to disclose personal information to a third party. Furthermore taxpayer information can be extremely sensitive, and quite apart from Data Protection law, Revenue has a duty to protect taxpayer confidentiality.  However, Revenue fully recognise the role of public representatives in relation to their constituents.When Deputies make representations on behalf of individual taxpayers, these representations normally contain personal information such as the individual's PPS Number or other personal tax identifiers.  In these circumstances there is generally enough evidence to reasonably support Revenue in a presumption of consent on the part of the taxpayer underpinning the interaction.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this approach is working well; for example, in the year 2009 more than three hundred and sixty representations were directed to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners by public representatives in relation to individual taxpayer issues.  Indeed, the Deputy will be aware that in the last eighteen months he himself has received responses to and been supplied with information from Revenue in relation to twelve cases where he wrote directly to the Chairman of Revenue or through official local channels, and thirty-nine cases where he submitted queries through the Parliamentary Question process.Revenue staff are expected to take great care to protect taxpayers' information and accordingly, where enquiries of a general nature are made by telephone to Revenue it is not unreasonable that staff should request evidence of consent in advance of passing on personal information.  While it may be that the Deputy has a particular request in mind, he will appreciate that telephone enquiries may necessitate an extra level of vigilance in relation to the level of proof of consent required.The Revenue Commissioners advise me that they have a dedicated enquiry line for members of the House which can be reached on (01) 679 58 52.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	799	I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that data is not separately maintained on the enforcement action taken by them against small businesses. However, I am informed that a total of 22,668 certificates in respect of €385m. in unpaid tax liabilities were issued by Revenue to the Sheriffs in the period from 1 January to 31 August 2010 (which is a slight decrease on the same period in 2009).  A total of 17,498 businesses that were registered with Revenue ceased trading in the same period. 1,206 of these businesses were companies that have gone into liquidation. Some 30% of the companies that went into liquidation in that period were wound up by their members with no outstanding debts to any creditor. Of the remainder, Revenue initiated legal proceedings that lead to the courts winding up some 36 companies by way of the appointment of a liquidator.The Revenue Commissioners are charged with responsibility for collection and recovery of a wide range of taxes and duties. The Revenue Commissioners take the decision on what collection and recovery measures should be deployed in any specific case and in what timeframe and are not subject to any direction by me in that regard. I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. Revenue is fully determined to take the necessary collection enforcement action, including referral of cases to the Sheriffs, to pursue tax debts from taxpayers that fail to meet their liabilities on time and do not engage fully and honestly with Revenue in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement to return the business to full tax compliance as quickly as possible. I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard.I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate in this country and how that impacts on business in being timely compliant. Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.I am aware that the feedback from trade representative and tax practitioner bodies to the work of Revenue in that regard has been positive and is regarded as an effective way of supporting businesses who are disposed to addressing payment difficulties in a positive, realistic and proactive way.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The withdrawal of any bank from the Irish market is a matter of regret because it reduces the level of competition between banks and causes disruption for the customers of the bank concerned. I note, however, that other banks are mounting campaigns to attract those customers and that at least one other foreign owned bank has reaffirmed its commitment to the Irish market.The availability of adequate working capital for all sectors of the economy including the hotel and catering sector is crucial to their ongoing sustainability and the Government has taken a number of steps to ensure this availability to viable businesses.The Credit Review Office has been set up to ensure that the banks are not refusing credit to viable businesses and any businesses who are refused credit should first use the internal appeal process in their bank and then follow up with the Credit Review Office is necessary. In addition, the SME lending plans of AIB and Bank of Ireland mean that credit should be available as required by SMEs.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will work with John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office on options to enhance support for SMEs.

Total liabilities guaranteed under the ELG Scheme amounted to €153 billion at the end of June. The comparable figure at end June for the CIFS Scheme was €103 billion.However, the covered institutions have paid fees to the State in respect of the guarantee — as at end August 2010 €730m has been received by the State in respect of the CIFS scheme and €295m has been received in respect of the ELG scheme.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available are set out in the following tables for 2006, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.Estimates of the prospective yield to the Exchequer in 2011 from the abolition or standard rating of each deduction and relief from incomes over the specified ranges are not available. These estimates could not be provided without undertaking an extensive and costly development of the Revenue tax model nor would they capture any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such change or their economic effects.Estimates of the costs of tax deductions and reliefs for 2007 are currently being compiled.Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2006 and 2005.The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits. To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.The figures of cost are for 2006 and 2005 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2005 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2007 Report.TABLE IT6: Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2005 and 2006.(1) Estimated cost for20052006€mNumbers€mNumbersINCOME TAX

65.213574.7141NOTES ON TABLE IT 6(1) Figures accompanied by an asterisk* are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.(2) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a “net pay” basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for background commentary and cost figures for 2007.(7) Arising from the work on the “Green Paper on Pensions” (2007) the basis for costing this item was changed for 2005 and is not directly comparable with the figures for earlier years. See also the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for more recent figures.(8) “Other” relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.(9) The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits, income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), and also includes tax on (see Note 10) (a) donations made by the PAYE and self-employed sectors to approved bodies (b) income tax repayments on foot of PAYE donations. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.(10) The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.(11) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2005 and 200(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with “unused capital allowances”, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company’s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3,340 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2006 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2005 and 2006 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.(15) The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional(16) The costs shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2005 and 2006. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.Green Paper on Pensions — updated estimates of cost for 2007.As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2007 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2007 are included in the table below:Estimated costsNumbers*€ millionEmployees’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes590708,100Employers’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes150385,100**Estimated cost of exemption of employers’ contributions from employee BIK540385,100Exemption of investment income and gains of approved Superannuation Funds900Not availableRetirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)420123,900Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)6556,400Estimated cost of tax relief on “tax-free” lump sum payments130Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee and employer contributions240Not availableGross cost of tax relief3,035Estimated tax yield from payment of pension benefits410Net cost of tax relief2,625*Numbers as included in P35 returns from employers to Revenue for 2007.

This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2006, is set out in the following table.The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.Tax Incentive/Income ExemptionAmount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax costNumber of claimants€m€mUrban renewal351.7140.53,436Town Renewal93.038.71,149Seaside Resorts15.76.41,167Rural Renewal94.038.02,137Multi-storey car parks40.216.6119Living Over the shop7.12.782Enterprise Areas7.43.0129Park and Ride6.92.832Holiday Cottages22.99.5660Hotels277.1106.61,515Nursing Homes35.514.7538Housing for the Elderly/infirm3.41.495Hostels1.960.8223Guest Houses0.20.17Convalescent Homes4.11.718Qualifying Private Hospitals25.210.6284Qualifying sports injury clinics0.103Buildings Used for certain childcare purposes14.36.0304Student Accommodation162.564.31,059Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.40.16Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions90.722.5185Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands13.65.41,231Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)395.083.81,120Totals1,662.9576.215,299Notes:The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2006 form 11 and CT1.There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 42% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6.

The task of the NAMA Board is to assess, for each debtor, the ultimate viability of that debtor, given the scale of his debts and the quality of the assets securing them.In the case of the ten Tranche 1 debtors, draft plans have been through a number of iterations and are either being reviewed by the NAMA Board or will be reviewed over the coming weeks. It is reasonable to point out that a review of debtors, some of whom have aggregate debts running into billions, is not an exercise that can be carried out quickly, given the scale and complexity involved. At this stage, many of the Tranche 2 debtors have submitted or are about to submit draft business plans and a similar process is being followed with them.To the extent that there have been delays in the process, it has been caused by the initial failure of some debtors to submit plans in line with the detailed template provided by NAMA. Some debtors were also asked to revise their original assumptions and projections so as to bring them into line with a realistic outlook for supply and demand for the various asset classes and geographical regions in which they operate.The Deputy's raises a question in relation to independent business reviewers who have declined assignments offered by NAMA. I understand that a small number of firms have done so and have indicated to NAMA their dissatisfaction with the proposed fee arrangements.

Since the introduction of the moratorium the numbers employed in the public service have steadily decreased and the latest numbers reported to my Department for end-June 2010 were 308,370. This is a decrease of approximately 11,000 whole time equivalents since the end of 2008.2000200120022003200420052006200720082009247,343269,799279,274279,609284,787292,129304,512312,131319,440309,791*Note that the above figures are on a whole-time equivalent basis, and are subject to revisions reflecting methodological changes and updated information regarding numbers in particular sectors.These numbers include employees in the Civil Service, Education Sector, Justice Sector, Health Sector, Defence Sector, Local Authority Sector and Non-Commercial State Agencies (NCSA). In addition, public servants whose pay is not in all cases funded directly by the Exchequer are included in the numbers.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	807	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows.Firstly, the Revenue Commissioners acknowledge that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes.  However, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2009 had not been taxed in Ireland.  It is important to emphasise that this estimate would include both illicit cigarettes and legal cross-border purchases brought into the State for personal consumption.Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-border purchases. Based on an estimate of 14%, the loss of Excise duty to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 would be in the region of €200m.The strategy of the Revenue Commissioners for tackling this illicit trade is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU wide and international basis, ongoing review of  operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and internally to  intercept and seize the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.Revenue officials are located at all key ports and airports and they are focussed on the interception and seizure of illicit products at the point of importation.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the retail level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, coordinating national blitz-style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.In recent years, Revenue has signed Memoranda of Understanding with two of the main cigarette manufacturers, ITL and JTI, to further cooperation in relation to the illicit tobacco trade.  In addition, Revenue meets regularly with the trade association representing the leading tobacco companies as well as the four major global manufacturers.The problem of tobacco smuggling is a global one and requires a very high level of international and inter-agency co-operation.  In this regard Revenue's Customs Service works very closely with their colleagues in An Garda Siochána on a multi-agency basis and with enforcement agencies throughout the EU and with OLAF, the EU Anti-Fraud agency.  This high level of co-operation has resulted in many successful detections of illicit products and in the prosecution of those responsible.   Earlier this month the Revenue Commissioners together with the European Anti-Fraud Agency (OLAF) co-hosted a conference in Dublin on the illicit tobacco trade.  The conference, which was the first of its kind, brought investigators and prosecutors from all 27 member states together with their counterparts from law enforcement agencies from across the U.S.A.  The conference recognised that the problem of illicit tobacco was a global concern.Revenue's strategies in relation to the detection of tobacco-related offences are under continuous review.  For example, in July of this year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the sole purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7m cigarettes and 195 kgs tobacco in the course of the two week period of the operation.This multi-faceted approach that Revenue has adopted has resulted in the seizure of 148m cigarettes and more than 2,400 kgs of tobacco to date this year.Follow-up investigations are also conducted with a view to identifying those responsible and instituting criminal proceedings where the necessary evidence has been obtained. In 2009 the Revenue Commissioners prosecuted 165 cases for various tobacco offences.My Department, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, regularly review the legislative framework.   For example, the penalties for tobacco offences were significantly increased in the Finance Act 2010 when the penalty for conviction on indictment increased from €12,695 to €126,950 or up to three times the duty paid value of the goods, whichever is the greater, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.

I refer in particular to the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme (MIS) funded by the Department of Social Protection, the Money Advice Budgeting Service (MABS), and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.In addition to the above support measures, in my Budget speech in December I refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market.  Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.The Renewed Programme for Government sets out the Government's commitments for introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their mortgage repayments and personal indebtedness under the headings Protecting the Family Home and Helping Those in Debt.  I have spoken extensively about the Government’s intentions in this regard, including during the passage of the National Asset Management Agency legislation.The Deputy will be aware that at the end of February, I announced the establishment of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group (Expert Group), under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney an insolvency accountant, as a follow up to the Government's commitments to homeowners under the Renewed Programme for Government. Among the terms of reference of the Expert Group is a requirement to make recommendations to me on options for improving the current situation for families with mortgage arrears and personal debt, and also to take into account the ESRI report on negative equity.Negative equity mainly applies to those homeowners who bought at high loan-to-value rates close to the peak of the market in 2006. The difficulty for the Government is that all estimates of the extent of negative equity appear to be based on very general economic assumptions, but it is very difficult to assess realistic price levels when property market activity remains low. Also, being in negative equity does not change the level of mortgage payments.  The priority for Government is to ensure as far as possible that mortgage borrowers in arrears or facing into an arrears situation do not end up in legal proceedings for home repossessions. Home repossessions should be and generally have been the last resort for most lenders.The Expert Group has completed the first phase of its work and submitted an Interim Report to me in July www.finance.gov.ie. The Interim Report's key recommendations address the issues of communication between householders in arrears and their lenders, and the need for a more consistent assessment process by lenders of borrowers in difficulty in the form of an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures.  The Expert Group in its Interim Report also includes a number of recommendations relating to the operation of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme which is intended to support homeowners who are in difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments due to being unemployed.  The recommendations of the Expert Group have been accepted in full by the Government and action is being taken to bring them into effect.The Expert Group is now in the process of addressing the more complex issues of homeowners who are facing long term difficulties in meeting their mortgage and personal debt commitments and will make recommendations to me at the end of next month.

This body of legislation deals with a range of issues including authorisation provisions, prudential supervision and governance matters. The day to day responsibility for ensuring that the insurance industry complies with this legislation is a matter for the Financial Regulator which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.Consumer issues are covered by the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code which amongst other things sets out a series of general principles about how financial service firms (including all insurance companies) should interact with their customers. The Code however does not prohibit or restrict an insurance company which conducts life insurance business from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question. In this regard the  Financial Regulator has advised me previously in relation to similar type of enquiries  that premiums for what are known as "Whole of Life " policies are not fixed and can increase over the duration of the policy.The persons in question have the option of referring this matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman at www.financialombudsman.ie for investigation and adjudication.

On the 13 May 2010 the NPRFC received 198 million ordinary shares of AIB in lieu of a cash payment of the dividend on the preference shares. The payment was made in the form of ordinary shares as the European Commission requested that discretionary coupon payments on Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments in Bank of Ireland and AIB not be paid while it considered each bank's restructuring plan. This number of shares was equal to the aggregate cash amount of the annual dividend of €280 million, divided by the average price per share in the 30 trading days prior to the payment date.€3.5bn was invested by way of preference stock in BOI on 31 March 2009. On 22 February 2010 the NPRFC received 184 million units of ordinary stock in lieu of a cash payment of the dividend on the preference stock, this being the number of units equal to the aggregate cash amount of the 2010 dividend of €250 million divided by 100% of the average price per unit of ordinary stock in the 30 trading days prior to the payment date.As part of BOI's capital raise completed in the first half of 2010, the NPRFC converted 1,663 million units of preference stock into 1,715 million units of ordinary stock through participation in a rights issue and a direct placement of ordinary stock.  In addition, as part of the capital raise, the NPRFC received €543m in transaction fees and payment for cancellation of the warrants and the interest rate on the remaining preference shares was increased from 8% to 10.25%.As a result of the directed investments referred to above, the NPRFC holds 1,900 million units of ordinary stock in BoI and 1,837 million units of 2009 preference stock.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	812	As indicated in my statement of the 8th September the Government believes that it is essential to identify, with as much certainty as possible, the final cost for the restructuring and resolution of the bank.  This will underpin international financial confidence in Ireland.  Accordingly, the Central Bank/Financial Regulator was asked to determine the appropriate levels of capital needed in both institutions by October.This assessment has now been completed. The Financial Regulator has determined that in the central — or expected loss case — an additional €6.4bn. in total capital will be required for the Recovery Bank and Funding Bank structure to continue to meet minimum capital requirements in the coming years consistent with Basel 2 rules. As the House will be aware a total of €22.9bn has already been provided by the State to support Anglo Irish Bank since the bank was nationalised early in 2009. This additional capital requirement brings the projected total cost of the restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank to €29.3bn.Because of the recent volatility in the markets and the need to bring as much certainty to the situation I asked the Financial Regulator to undertake a stress test on Anglo building on the PCAR analysis carried out for the other banks earlier in the year.  The Financial Regulator has determined that on the basis of severe stress assumptions — including a 70% discount on the remainder of Anglo's NAMA loans– the stress case level of losses in Anglo Irish Bank are €5bn. higher than in the base case of €29.3bn.In order to safeguard the financial interests of the State it is vital for all to understand fully and present accurately and in a balanced way the fundamental difference between these two figures I have announced this evening.The Financial Regulator's determination of the base case capital requirement for Anglo is €29.3bn.  This is the Financial Regulator's best estimate of the capital required to meet those losses expected to arise from the remaining NAMA transfers and on the those loans not transferring in the years ahead.The stress case estimate does not represent the Financial Regulator's expectation of the most likely outcome — it delimits the boundary of the level of losses that could arise if the bank were to experience unexpected additional losses in certain severe stressed scenarios.The Government will ensure that the new structure for Anglo is capitalised to an appropriate level to maintain its stability throughout the restructuring process taking into account both the Financial Regulator's base and stress case and the contribution that could be made by further burden sharing exclusively by holders of subordinated debt in the bank.The revised plan will be completed over the next two weeks in finalising the bank's revised restructuring to be submitted to the European Commission.  It will also be a priority for authorities to press ahead rapidly with the restructuring of the bank with a view to achieving the split of the bank early in 2011.  I am confident following further consultations with the European Commission that Commissioner Almunia will be in a position to indicate his agreement in principle to the proposed restructuring next month.  This should allow the matter to be settled through a formal Commission Decision on a timely basis.It is important to point out that this restructuring is not a winding down of the bank.  The revised structure requires the Asset Recovery bank to focus on working out the assets of the bank over time.

The Government has a clear economic growth strategy in place.  The four key elements of the strategy are:fiscal consolidation in order to put the public finances on a sustainable path;repairing the banking system to ensure that credit is available to support viable economic activity;improving our competitiveness so that exports can once again become the engine of growth in the Irish economy;upskilling of the labour force to ensure that those who lose their jobs are in a position to gain employment in expanding sectors of the economy.It is the Government's targeted actions in each of these areas that will ensure that the economy reverts to a sustainable growth path.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	815	On 30 March 2009 I directed the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Bank of Ireland and on 12 May 2009 I directed the Commission to invest €3.5 billion in preference shares issued by Allied Irish Banks plc (AIB). I gave these directions having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and having decided that the investments were required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system.These investments were in perpetual preference shares with an annual non-cumulative fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or, in the case of non-payment by either bank of the cash dividend, ordinary shares in lieu. The preference shares could be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of the issue and at 125% of face value thereafter. Warrants issued with, but detachable from, the preference shares gave an option to purchase up to 25% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of each bank (following exercise of the warrants). The warrants were exercisable at any time from the fifth to tenth anniversary of issue of the preference shares or immediately prior to any takeover or merger of the bank concerned, whichever is earlier. The number of ordinary shares which may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants was subject to anti-dilution protection in line with market norms for warrants. Accordingly, the warrants will be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of ordinary shares in issue resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of units of ordinary shares. The warrants will also be proportionately adjusted for any capital distributions by the bank and for certain bonus issues or rights issues by the bank.In February and May 2010 the Fund received ordinary shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB respectively in lieu of cash as payment of the first dividend on its preference share investments. The payment was made in the form of ordinary shares as the European Commission has requested that discretionary coupon payments on Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 capital instruments in Bank of Ireland and AIB not be paid while it considers each bank's restructuring plan. The number of shares issued in each case represents the amount of the annual preference share dividend divided by the average share price in the 30 trading days prior to the date of issue.On 25 April 2010, again having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and having decided that it is required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system,  I issued directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission  to convert part of its €3.5 billion holding of Bank of Ireland preference stock into ordinary stock as part of the capital raising exercise announced by the bank on 26 April. The details of the transaction are as follows:Placing/ Conversion (Step 1)The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) subscribed for 576 million units of ordinary stock. In exchange for this stock the NPRF converted 1,036 million units of preference stock at their issue price of €1.00 into ordinary stock.Warrant cancellationThe NPRF received €491 million in cash in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock.Rights Issue (Step 2)The NPRF participated in the Bank of Ireland rights issue taking up the full allocation to which it is entitled at a price of €0.55 per unit of ordinary stock.  In order to exercise the rights, the NPRF converted a further 627 million units of its preference stock into ordinary stock.FeesThe NPRF received €52 million in fees for its participation in the transaction.Change in dividend rate on preference stockThe dividend rate on the remaining preference stock increases from 8.00% to 10.25%.The transaction involved no new investment by the NPRF in Bank of Ireland and was funded entirely via conversion of preference stock.  Including the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock and fees, the NPRF has received total cash income of €543m from Bank of Ireland for participation in the transaction.The NPRF's directed investment in Bank of Ireland now consists of:1,900 million units of ordinary stock valued at their current market price (36% of the bank's ordinary stock in issue); and1,837 million units of preference stock held at their issue price of €1.00 paying an annual dividend of 10.25%.The NPRF's directed investment in AIB now consists of:3,500 million units of preference shares held at their issue price of €1.00 paying an annual dividend of 8.00%.198 million ordinary shares valued at their current market price (18% of the bank's ordinary stock in issue).On 30 March 2010 I gave details to the House of the further capital needs of the banks in order to meet the Financial Regulator's requirement of a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, of which 7% must be equity.  In the case of AIB I said the Regulator has determined that AIB must raise additional equity capital of at least €7.4 billion by the end of the year to meet the new base case capital standards.  AIB immediately commenced the process of the sale of overseas assets as a first step in meeting its capital needs.The Central Bank has now assessed the impact of the increased NAMA discount on AIB's capital requirements and has concluded that an additional amount of €3bn will be required. This brings the total capital requirement for AIB, after deducting the capital generated on the sale of its Polish subsidiary, to €7.9bn.In order to afford every opportunity to AIB to raise as much as possible of the required capital from the markets and to minimise further Government support, it has been decided that this capital requirement will be met through a placing and open offer to shareholders of AIB shares to the value of €5.4bn. This transaction will be fully underwritten by the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission (NPRFC) at a fixed price of €0.50 per share and is expected to be completed in 2010 subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. If necessary, the NPRFC's underwriting commitment will be satisfied by the conversion of up to €1.7bn. of its existing preference shares in the bank into ordinary shares along with a new cash investment for the balance of €3.7bn in ordinary shares. This transaction structure assumes the sale of AIB's stake in M&T Bank and disposal of other assets in due course.In the event that the bank's residual capital requirement is not met through asset sales by 31 March 2011, any shortfall will be met by the conversion of a proportion of the remaining €1.8bn. of preference shares. The company will issue a prospectus in relation to the open offer in due course giving details of the transaction, underwriting structure and timing. In the first instance, existing shareholders will be given the option of subscribing for the whole or part of their entitlement to new shares under the offer pro rata to their existing holdings. New institutional shareholders may also be permitted to subscribe for new shares.  Any additional capital required will be provided by the NPRFC.Ireland is committed to ensuring that all additional aid to AIB will be granted in line with State aid rules. To this end, it will notify the new measures to seek State aid approval before they are implemented.  As a consequence of these actions it is likely that the State will hold a majority shareholding in AIB.The high level of State support being provided to AIB, as an institution, is absolutely necessary given the central role that AIB plays in the Irish economy and in the Irish financial system. In the coming weeks I will be working closely with the Board of the Bank on behalf of the Government to ensure that AIB successfully overcomes its current challenges and develops a renewed strategic focus on the Irish market following the divestiture of its overseas operations.

Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.An individual aged 65 or over is only eligible for a refund of or exemption from DIRT if his or her taxable income, including deposit interest, does not exceed the relevant income tax exemption limit — €20,000 for single individuals and €40,000 for married couples.  Such individuals would be unlikely to have savings in excess of €300,000.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	819	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the aggregate amount of trading losses for Corporation Tax returned by companies for accounting periods ending in 2008 (the latest year for which figures are available) was approximately €17.4 billion and the aggregate amount of losses carried forward from earlier accounting periods was €11.7 billion. The equivalent figures for Income Tax were €653 million and €438 million.These figures reflect an inevitable increase in the incidence of trading losses due to the economic downturn. I should emphasise that the figures do not represent the actual amount of trading losses used to claim relief in the period. Revenue's computer systems do not provide data on the aggregate amount of trading losses actually used by companies to offset profits in a year and, therefore, information is not available on the overall Exchequer effect of loss relief claimed each year. The Revenue Commissioners are currently examining how best their data processing systems for Corporation Tax can be adapted to provide details of the aggregate amount of loss relief used in a year and the Exchequer effect of such relief.In relation to the surrender of trading losses by Companies to other Group Companies, claimed as an element of group relief, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the aggregate amount group relief claimed by companies for accounting periods ending in 2008 was approximately €8.4 billion. This includes trading losses and various other amounts surrendered by group companies such as capital allowances and non-trade charges. However, it is not possible to separately identify the amount of trading losses that are included in the figure and, as the figures are from the tax returns submitted, they may be subject to change following processing and assessment in Revenue. Therefore, the amount of losses actually used as group relief in the periods concerned may differ from the figure above.I should add that losses incurred in a trade are a fact of business life and the provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and that of all other countries in the OECD. It would be difficult to justify taxing business income without taking due account of business losses or, in the context of groups of companies under common ownership, without allowing the sideways set-off within the group of losses that reduce the overall profitability of the group.

However, where the shares are awarded through a Revenue approved profit sharing scheme, the employees are not chargeable to income tax on the value of the shares awarded, subject to a general annual limit of €12,700 on the value of shares. The cost to the Exchequer is essentially the income tax foregone on the value of any shares awarded under such schemes. Apart from approved profit sharing schemes, there are some other tax-advantaged employee financial participation schemes that must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners in order for the tax relief to apply.  These are:Approved share option schemes, under which employees are not chargeable to income tax on any gains arising on the exercise of share options;Savings-related share option schemes, which comprise a share option scheme element and a savings element. Interest or bonuses arising on any savings that may be used to acquire shares are not chargeable to income tax;Employee share ownership trusts, which work in conjunction with approved profit sharing schemes and have the further tax advantage of not being taxable on any dividends received in respect of shares held by the trust where such dividend income is used to purchase further shares;Income tax relief in respect of new shares purchased on issue by employees of certain trading companies up to a lifetime limit of €6,350.The following table sets out the estimated cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax foregone in respect of the various share-related schemes for 2007, the latest year for which this information is available.Employee Share SchemesEstimated cost to the Exchequer*€mApproved  profit-sharing  schemes106Employee  share-ownership trusts4Approved share-option schemes3Approved savings-related share option schemes12Relief for new shares purchased on issue by employees<1*Figures are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.

It is not possible to predict the effect such a levy would have on the behaviour and decisions of holding companies with foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of any yield that might accrue to the Exchequer if such a levy were imposed on the their profits.  In any event, such a levy would be unlikely to yield significant additional Irish tax because many of the holding companies with foreign subsidiaries would be entitled, under the terms of our Double Taxation Treaties, to reduce the additional charge by the amount of foreign tax paid on the profits out of which their dividend income was paid.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that Corporation Tax is not charged on dividends received by a company from another company resident in the State, subject to certain exceptions. The reason for this exemption is that such dividends are paid out of profits of the dividend-paying company which have already been subject to Corporation Tax and to apply a corporation tax charge on the company receiving the dividends would, in effect, amount to double taxation.If the exemption were to be abolished and companies were to be made chargeable to Corporation Tax on dividends received from other companies resident in the State, it would be necessary to allow a credit for Corporation Tax paid by the dividend-paying company on the profits out of which the dividends were paid. As such a credit would offset the Corporation Tax payable on dividends received, there would be no net gain to the Exchequer from the abolition of this exemption, but there would be additional administrative demands on companies and the Revenue Commissioners.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 163 together.Deferral of Capital Gains Tax is provided for in a company reorganisation or amalgamation that does not involve a cash payment.  These are generally referred to as "paper for paper" transactions.  If the company reorganisation or amalgamation involves a cash payment, the cash element is taxed in the normal way.Deferring tax in the case of a paper for paper exchange recognises not only the fact that the transaction has not produced cash with which to pay tax, but also that the parties concerned have not disposed of their interest in the underlying assets.  This treatment is in line with international practice.  It is also provided for in the EU Mergers Directive (90/434/EEC) OJ No. L 225 28.8.1990.Where shares are exchanged in a corporate reorganisation, the exchange does not give rise to a charge to Capital Gains Tax. However, shares held as trading stock are not chargeable assets and do not come within the scope of the Capital Gains Tax Acts. Shares held as trading stock are relevant to the computation of income rather than capital gains.  In computing a company's income there are no special rules relating to the exchange of shares held as trading stock.  A disposal of shares held as trading stock is within the charge to tax as part of the company's trading profits, which are computed in accordance with accounting principles.  As transfers in the course of corporate reorganisations or amalgamations do not give rise to tax under the current legislation the Revenue Commissioners do not have information regarding the number of value of such transactions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	828	As transfers between Group Companies are not taxable transactions, the Revenue Commissioners do not have information regarding such transactions that would enable the figure requested to be estimated.The Capital Gains Tax Acts permit the transfer of assets within a Corporate Group on a no gain/no loss basis for Capital Gains Tax purposes and tax is then levied when assets are sold outside the Group. The tax payable when the asset is sold outside the Group will be the tax on the full gain accruing since the asset was first acquired by a Group Company.For financial reporting purposes, a Company prepares its own accounts and then, if it is a member of a Group, these results will be consolidated into the financial results of its ultimate Parent Company. In this way, the Group is treated as a single business entity with the results of each Group member being pooled to give the results and financial position for the Group as a whole.  However, for tax purposes, each Company within a Group is treated as a separate entity. Each Company in the Group makes its own Tax Return, computes its own liability and is assessed on and pays that liability separately. This separate Company approach is modified in specific respects to acknowledge the common ownership of the Companies that are members of the same Corporate Group. In relation to transfers of assets within a Corporate Group, the Tax Acts reflect the fact that the transfer does not result in a change in the ultimate corporate ownership of the asset.

As the benefit of the 4 year write-off is largely one of timing, its abolition would not be expected to give rise to gains to the Exchequer in the long run, as any resultant annual gains would be offset by increased tax deductions in the year of disposal or death of the stallion.

However, relief is still available in the tax year 2011 for service charges due in 2010 and actually paid.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	834	As regards capital expenditure, the Government published Infrastructure Investment Priorities for 2010 — 2016 in July 2010. The core rationale for the current investment in public infrastructure is to create the framework conditions to facilitate a return to growth and thereby support sustainable job creation into the longer term. This can be achieved through capital investment in infrastructure which bolsters the economy's productive capacity such as the road network, the water services infrastructure, broadband provision and educational facilities among many more areas.Adjustments in expenditure, capital or current, and tax policy, have an impact on the economy in that they can result in changes in consumption and investment patterns leading to changes in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy is mainly a function of the marginal propensity to consume and generally changes in policy are assumed to lead to a buoyancy factor in the range of 20 to 30 per cent. A buoyancy factor in the lower range is generally thought appropriate in terms of capital expenditure.

The Statutory Instrument provides the legislative basis for the extension of the ELG Scheme to 31 December 2010 for both deposits and liabilities eligible under the Scheme reflecting the approvals granted by the European Commission on 28 June 2010 and 21 September 2010 in line with the relevant State aid rules. Approval for the continued provision of financial support under the ELG Scheme must be sought from the European Commission every six months in accordance with EU State aid requirements.This is an important support to the Irish banking system, facilitating its access to both short and longer term funding to help maintain the overall stability of the banking sector and complements the broad Government Strategy to restore fully the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.My Department and the relevant state authorities along with the EU Commission will continue to monitor market developments over the coming months so as to confirm that the Guarantee continues to underpin the core principles of financial stability and funding access for the financial institutions.Progress in relation to the phasing out of the guarantee will be achieved over time consistent with any requirement for continued support of the funding conditions of the banks and the maintenance of financial stability overall.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million. There are no plans to reverse these changes.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available. The remaining care provision is subject to prior approval, which will be required from a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for: high risk and exceptional patients; those requiring emergency care; and patients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.Where prior approval is required for the treatment, the HSE Principal Dental Surgeons will apply their professional judgment to determine, in the circumstances, whether or not there is a clinical emergency, and whether or not treatment should therefore be approved. The HSE will also monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  My colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has also called on providers of professional services in the private sector to adjust their fees in line with the reductions in fees of those providing such services in the public sector.  I should add that General Practitioners who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the Health Service Executive (HSE) must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	851	In June this year I launched a new cardiovascular policy "Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 -2019”.
This policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which will ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.The Cardiovascular Policy Report proposes that stroke services be reconfigured on a network basis at  hospital and emergency care level. Each network will provide specialist services by a blend of hospitals designated as (i) local/general and (ii) regional/comprehensive centres. Under the reconfigured hospital network system, stroke patients will be brought directly to the appropriate centre for initial treatment. An improved ambulance service will ensure that 80% of the population will be brought to the appropriate centre within the accepted critical timeframe.In the context of the implementation of the Report, the HSE has appointed two lead clinicians to direct the implementation of the recommendations in so far as stroke is concerned.  Funding will come from within current resources provided for in the HSE Service Plan. The HSE is currently identifying the hospitals and networks required to support the Policy.  As of July this year, 15 hospitals reported having an acute stroke unit and one further hospital has opened a stroke unit since then.  Some 16 hospitals reported delivering 24 hour thrombolysis.I have noted the contents of the recent Irish Heart Foundation's report on the estimated cost of stroke in Ireland.

In 2008 and 2009, €904,000 and €430,000 respectively was provided in direct funding to that organisation prior to the staff transferring to the Department.  In addition, an allocation of €1.6m has been made available in the current year to fund the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA).The main spending in relation to Older Persons is undertaken by the HSE.  As set out in the National Service Plans 2008-2010,  the allocations for Services for Older Persons were  €1.239bn, €1.275bn and €1.316bn respectively.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	854	The Programme for Government 2007-2012 identified the need ‘to better recognise the position of older people in Irish society' and committed to develop a National Positive Ageing Strategy to establish the strategic framework for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  A key function of my office, which was established in 2008, is to develop this Strategy.A call for submissions on the Strategy was issued in June 2009 and 192 submissions were received from a broad range of stakeholders. The top five priority themes that emerged from the submissions were: health and social care (64%); transport (40%); social inclusion (36%); housing (33%); income and pensions (27%).In May 2010, I completed a three-month country-wide series of consultation meetings to hear the views of older people, service providers and representative organisations at first hand.  These meetings were held in Cork, Sligo, Galway, Kildare, Wexford, Newcastle West, Dundalk, Dublin and Athlone.  I also held consultation meetings with a number of NGOs who represent more vulnerable or marginalised older people.At the public consultation meetings, participants suggested how services/programmes could be improved and have given views on what works well and what could be done differently or in a better way (particularly how service delivery could be enhanced in the light of current resource constraints). The themes that arose during the public consultation meetings are broadly consistent with those outlined in the written submissions received.The Strategy is being developed by a Cross-Departmental Group (CDG), comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments,  the Central Statistics Office and An Garda Síochána, and is chaired by the Director of the Office for Older People. An NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national-level non-governmental organisations with an interest in older people's issues and an Expert Advisory Group, which is in the process of being established, will also inform the process.  Work to develop the Strategy is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The Strategy is being developed within the constraints posed by the present fiscal situation. It is not the intention that the Strategy will propose new service developments; rather it will set strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people.A report on the consultation process to highlight the issues which older people and service providers have brought to my attention will be published shortly. It is intended that a draft Strategy will be completed by the end of 2010.

Thankfully due to the speedy actions of the train driver on that day and the effective operation of all post accident procedures, there were no fatalities or injuries to any members of the public or staff.  However, I recognise that the report gives a detailed and worrying account of an inadequate maintenance and inspection regime in Iarnród Eireann (IE) of recent years which failed to safeguard the viaduct structure from the impact of scour and erosion in Broadmeadow Estuary.I wrote to the Chairman of CIÉ on 17 August last emphasising the importance of implementing in full the recommendations made to Iarnród Éireann by the RAIU and the Railway Safety Commission (RSC) in its compliance audit.  I referred to the importance of regular progress updates to be provided by Iarnród Éireann as part of the monitoring of the railway safety investment programme funded by my Department.  In addition I asked the Chairman to provide an early update on the progress of the implementation of the RAIU and RSC recommendations.As indicated in the RAIU report and from updates received from Iarnród Éireann significant changes have now taken place to meet the shortcomings identified and to ensure that there is no repetition of this incident.  Iarnród Éireann has identified and conducted detailed surveys on 105 bridges that are particularly susceptible to scour and has not found any scour related risks with any of these bridge structures.  There has also been a substantial reorganisation of the IE Civil Engineering department including the appointment of a new Chief Civil Engineer and a Technical Manager for civil engineering.I understand from the Railway Safety Commission that there was an approved Safety Management System (SMS) in place at the time of the accident.  However I am informed that Iarnród Eireann are currently fully revising their SMS to meet the latest European Railway Safety requirements and that the Railway Safety Commission expect to complete the process of approval of this new SMS in 2011.  As the independent regulator, the RSC has the power to bring sanctions under the Railway Safety Act 2005.  I understand that, based on the evidence in the RAIU report, the RSC is considering what sanctions, if any, are appropriate or possible under the legislation.I should add that over the period since 1998 the safety of the rail network has been enhanced through a sustained high level of investment and the strengthening of safety regulation arrangements and institutions.  Total investment in railway safety in the period 1999 to 2008 amounted to €1,172 million.  A further investment programme provides for total expenditure of €513 million over the period 2009 to 2013, which includes an allocation of €100 million this year alone.

Through these and similar measures I would expect to see most civil servants in my Department increasingly engaged in e-working by 2013.  Furthermore my Department currently has five officers engaged in tele-working.  The Smarter Travel Plan 2009-2010 recognises that flexible and e-working policies can contribute to reducing the need to travel and to achieving modal shift.

Certain conditions apply to the right to apply for and to obtain the access order.  As part of its Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014, the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper ‘Legal Aspects of Family Relationships', in September 2009.  In its Paper the Commission makes provisional recommendations on the rights and duties of extended family members including grandparents.  The Commission invited submissions on its provisional recommendations as part of its consultation process.  The Commission's final report and recommendations, expected to be published later this year, will help to inform debate on the issues in advance of the formulation of any proposals for reform of the law in this area.

On 7 May 2010, an application to have the Deportation Order revoked, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), was received from the legal representative of the person concerned.  This application is under consideration at present and a decision is expected shortly. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the relevant party.  While the consideration of this application is not a review of the case as such, it will involve a detailed examination of the latest information submitted to determine if this is materially different to the information which was before the then Minister when the original decision to deport was made.In relation to the asylum claim made by the person concerned, the position is that this claim was examined by both of the statutory independent refugee status determination bodies, namely the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  In assessing each individual asylum claim or appeal, the bodies referred to must, in accordance with their statutory remit, have regard for the specific claims made by an applicant as measured against objective, reputable, up to date information relating to the applicant's country of origin and, where doubts exist, the benefit of the doubt is applied in favour of the applicant.  I understand that copies of the determinations made by the two bodies were sent to the person concerned at the appropriate times, and to his then legal representatives, so the person concerned will be able to see from those documents the basis for the conclusions reached in his particular case.Overall, I am satisfied that the State has a very fair and comprehensive mechanism in place for the consideration of all asylum applications and, as such, I am satisfied that the asylum application made by the person concerned was properly considered before a final decision to refuse it was taken.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that plans are at an advanced stage to undertake a comprehensive refurbishment of the premises.  The principal reason for redevelopment is to facilitate works that will result in a substantial increase in prisoner capacity within the nearby female prison known as the Dóchas Centre.  When completed, the joint projects at Dóchas and the premises referred to by the Deputy will result in the provision of accommodation for approximately 70 additional female prisoners within the Dóchas Centre.  In addition to the extra prisoner accommodation, there are also plans to accommodate Irish Prison Service personnel at this site who occasionally have a requirement to spend time in Dublin.An invitation to tender for the refurbishment works and for provision of new prisoner accommodation at the Dóchas Centre issued to all eight member firms of the Irish Prison Service's Construction Framework Arrangement on Friday last, September 24th. 2010.  As a tender competition is currently in progress it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this matter as issues of commercial sensitivity and confidentiality arise.  However, I can confirm that the proposal to refurbish the premises in question has been properly and fully evaluated by officials within the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors.  Matters pertaining to the leasing of a premises in Clondalkin are pertinent to the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service has no involvement in this issue.

The decrease in average cost is attributed to the following two factors:a decrease in total costs of €17.7 million (of which €15.5 million relates to pay costs); andan increase in bed capacity of 495 from 3,611 as at 31st December 2008 to 4,106 as at 31st December 2009.Consistent with calculations in previous years, costs which are not under the direct control of the Irish Prison Service have been excluded.  Therefore, the teachers' salary costs are excluded from this exercise as these costs are not provided for under the Prisons budget allocation.  Similarly, capital expenditure, including building/equipment assets and small works, is excluded from the calculations in the interest of facilitating comparison between prison types

I have been further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Garda Reserve, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 629 with a further 99 in training.  The Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full time strength of the Force. Recruitment is ongoing and the Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.  I recently announced the start of a Garda recruitment campaign to establish a panel of approved candidates who will be available to meet future Garda recruitment needs.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. In managing its portfolio of accommodation, the RIA must ensure value for money in balancing the demand for, and supply of, asylum seeker accommodation.  Adjustments to the portfolio are made with the procurement of accommodation or the non-renewal or downsizing of contracts depending on demand.The contract for the accommodation at Mosney was renewed in June, 2010 with a capacity reduction from 800 to 650 bed spaces.  This reduction has been achieved in line with the accommodation needs of the RIA and in accordance with the efficiency targets recommended in the recently published Value Form Money report on asylum seeker accommodation.  In order to achieve reductions in the number of residents at Mosney, arrangements were made for 109 single adult asylum seekers to be re-accommodated at Hatch Hall accommodation centre in Dublin 2 and other locations where suitable accommodation and associated services for this group exist.To date, of the 109 persons scheduled to transfer, 41 have transferred to Hatch Hall, 36 have left direct provision or moved to other centres for which they expressed a preference and 6 persons have been allowed to remain at Mosney.  A further 26 persons, scheduled to transfer, remain at Mosney and the RIA is processing these cases with a view to finalising their future accommodation location.The types and profile of accommodation centres under contract to RIA vary in terms of the services supplied, duration, location and cost. The average cost per person per month for direct provision accommodation across all tenures is €770.28.  The reduction in the Mosney contract occupancy rate is expected to realise savings of in the order of €1.2m in 2010 alone and with ongoing savings in 2011.  Added to this, the RIA has achieved higher occupancy and more efficient usage of its portfolio with downsizing such as at Mosney and closures of other accommodation centres, thus effecting further savings in real terms.  The Value for Money report on asylum seeker accommodation recommended that occupancy levels at RIA accommodation should be in excess of 90% and this has been achieved.

In addition a significant number of files arising in the context of that legislation are with the Director of Public Prosecutions at present.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	881	I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the period 1 January, 1998 to 26 September, 2010, the most recent date for which figures are available, 203 murders involving a firearm were recorded.  All cases of murder where proceedings have not yet been taken remain under active investigation.  The detection rate by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore, such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.   Against that background, proceedings have been instituted in 61 cases and 25 convictions secured.I am, of course, deeply concerned about the incidence of gun murders and I deplore all such killings.  All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda Síochána in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is also reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year, and specific initiatives, including under Operation Anvil and involving members of the Emergency Response Unit, have been put in place.While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, the reality is that there can be considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities from associates of a victim of a gangland killing, or indeed from gangland figures even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.It was in that overall context that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda Síochána, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2010.  I am advised that to date eight persons have been charged with the offence of membership of a criminal gang under the legislative provisions introduced in 2009, and are before the courts.  In addition, a significant number of files arising in the context of the legislation have been submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.I have introduced further significant legislative proposals in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, and I will not hesitate to introduce additional measures if that becomes necessary. In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  There are very severe penalties for firearms offices in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Possessing a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, possessing a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, carrying a firearm with criminal intent and altering a firearm all carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.

It is not possible to provide figures to the Deputy on whether these persons had previously served a similar sentence in a prison or a place of detention without the manual examination of all their individual records.  This would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.However, the Deputy may wish to note that the Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology, published in 2008.  That study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence with one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  The fact that over 50% of prisoners do not re-offend within four years of release compares well internationally.

Prison staff providing accredited training possess qualifications or competencies in the relevant skill set and also complete a FETAC accredited Train the Trainer Programme.The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community, notably the VECs.  Literacy, numeracy and general basic education provision is a priority and broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.Education programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.  Educational courses and curricula, which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and sitting terminal examinations, are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners.  Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment. FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation.  All prison Education Units meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.  Considerable attention is paid to coordinating courses with the Work and Training programme described below.The education programmes provided can be broadly categorised as follows:Basic Education, including literacy, numeracy, English as a second language and communications;Creative Arts, notably music, sound recording and production, drama, art, craft, stone work, creative writing, film production and photography;Technology, including woodwork, woodcarving, metalwork, computer-aided design, information technology and horticulture;General Subjects, incorporating history, languages, geography, home economics and English literature;General Subjects, incorporating history, languages, geography, home economics and English literature;Life Skills, comprising notably personal development, interpersonal skills, anger management, parenting, child care, addiction studies, driver theory and food hygiene; andHealthy Living, notably physical education, sports, fitness and recreational activities, health education, diet and nutrition.Participation in education generally varies with factors such as access, facilities, turnover of population and segregation.  During 2009, approximately 39% of the prisoner population were engaged in education based on actual attendance at classes over the academic year.  In previous years the measure of participation was based on enrolment as distinct from actual attendance in a sample period.  The percentage enrolment was 51% in 2005, 47% in 2006, 50% in 2007 and 48% in 2008.Training activities are chosen to give as much employment as possible in prison and to give opportunities to acquire skills which will help prisoners secure employment on their release.  A wide range of training workshops operate within the institutions, e.g. printing, computers, braille, woodwork, metalwork, construction, industrial contract cleaning, craft, horticulture and electronics.  In addition, formal training is also provided in prison services such as catering and laundry.During 2009, the average number of prisoners participating in work and training activities was over 800 or over 21% of the average daily prison population.  External accreditation of certified training is available for a number of courses run within the institutions.  376 prisoners participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2009 which was slightly down on the 381 figure for  2008.The IPS is developing enhanced partnership arrangements with both City and Guilds and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) which will allow for centralised and co-ordinated management of the accreditation process and an expansion in the number of courses and activities with certification.  The skills areas, where additional certified courses will be delivered in the coming years, include painting and decorating, storage and warehousing, fork-lift driving, catering, metal/welding, construction, horticulture, electronics and laundry operations.I hope this gives the Deputy and the House an overview of the range of educational and training opportunities available to the prison population to assist offenders who are willing to engage in a purposeful manner with the available opportunities to improve and augment their skills.

This blueprint for how we tackle drugs in the prison setting continues to be implemented across our prisons.  This work involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population through meeting prisoners’ treatment and rehabilitative needs.At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids on committal is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification for operational reasons.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options which may include stabilization on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.Given the large number of prisoners requiring drug treatment services, the Irish Prison Service endeavours to provide a comprehensive range of such services in closed prisons.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services including addiction counselling provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.

CoolminePrisoners who on committal are engaged in a methadone substitution programme in the community will, in the main, have their methadone substitution treatment continued while in custody.  Methadone maintenance is available in 8 of the 14 places of detention accounting for over 75% of the prison population.  Details of the number of prisoners treated with drug related problems since 2006 is set out in the table below.Prison2006200720082009Cloverhill678710827808Dóchas216225245291Limerick8103758Midlands1990110182Mountjoy464594553794Portlaoise23420St.Patrick’s8152819Wheatfield184193210252Totals1,5791,8402,0142,424The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has spaces specifically allocated for a dedicated drug detoxification programme.  This programme is available to any prisoner who meets the qualifying criteria, subject to assessment.  Each multi-disciplinary programme has a duration of 6 weeks and the programme has a capacity of 9 prisoners at a time.  The dedicated multi-disciplinary drug detoxification programme in the Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison involves both prison based staff and external agencies and is aimed at assisting prisoners who have indicated a desire to move from either a situation of current drug use or existing substitution programme to drug free status.The Deputy may be interested to note that the Irish Prison Service has become the largest single initiator of drug treatment in the State and usually has as many prisoners in treatment as the Drug Treatment Centre Board at month end.  Drug treatment programmes continue to be enhanced and expanded.  For example, the Irish Prison Service, in the national context of drug treatment provision, has cared for over 20% of the total numbers on methadone nationally.  The expansion of these services is being achieved in partnership with statutory and community based services and will, I believe, result in a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment services in the prisons.Furthermore prisoners have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and ‘work and training' options which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.  Because of this multifaceted approach, it is not possible to give comprehensive detail on the number of prisoners engaged in the various treatment modalities.Currently the Irish Prison Service provides drug treatment for in excess of 700 prisoners nationally per month.  I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that methadone maintenance treatment in Irish prisons such as Mountjoy, Wheatfield and Cloverhill provide levels of coverage comparable to some of the highest levels of provision of methadone treatment in other European prisons.  I am also advised that the Irish Prison Service has identified and treated almost 31% of all new entrants to the Central Treatment List in 2009.  Indeed the prison service is now the leader in engaging new patients into drug treatment, often engaging patients who have been unable to secure community based treatment services.

I will communicate with the Deputy when I receive the information.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	887	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is within the Clontarf Garda Sub-District.  Local Garda management is aware of the incident referred to by the Deputy.  The scene was visited by Gardaí and subsequently a technical examination was carried out.  To date no one has been made amenable for the incident.  Gardaí will maintain contact with the injured party and continue to update them on the progress of the investigations which are ongoing.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

As the Deputy will be aware, copies of these documents are available at www.finance.gov.ie and in the Oireachtas Library.Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the Court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The Court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" in the case or the "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.The Deputy may wish to note that, under the 1962 Act, an applicant for free legal aid may be required by the Court to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  The operation of the Scheme is currently being examined in my Department in the context of preparing a new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

As I have previously advised the House it is the intention to incorporate Harristown House into the prison estate and accordingly, the House has been made available to the Irish Prison Service.  I have been advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that he is currently examining a range of options for the future use of the premises.

At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis.  In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are under review at present, in the light of the increasing demands being made upon it.

However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful and must relate to information which has not previously been considered.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

It is intended to commence this part of the Act shortly.  From date of commencement, FÁS will continue to provide these services but under the direction of my Department.   Further legislation is under preparation to provide for the transfer of the relevant staff and related resources from FÁS to my Department as early as possible in 2011.A major programme of change is currently being developed by my Department, in close consultation with senior management in FÁS and the Department of Education and Skills, with the objective of developing a new service vision and model for the integrated Department.   The aim is to create a Department which is structured around the customer rather than the schemes it delivers so that people can obtain the services they require, and are entitled to, in a seamless, effective and efficient way.I should add that the training services of FÁS will remain under the remit of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.

Given the volume of appeals, it is not possible to estimate the length of time before a case is determined.There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals. In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order.A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented,andSignificant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

Many recipients pay more than €24 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.A person who claims a one-parent family payment is required to seek maintenance from his/her spouse or the other parent of the child. These maintenance payments are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a one-parent family payment. However, vouched housing costs of up to €95.23 per week (rent or mortgage) are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment due.This disregard is then assessable in determining the appropriate level of rent supplement payable, as the amount of rent supplement is based on the net amount that a person has available to meet their accommodation costs from their own resources.Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than €95.23, the first €75 per week together with 25% of any additional maintenance above €75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. This is to ensure that the family benefits from the extra maintenance income up to that level before it affects their entitlement to rent supplement.Overall, the means assessment rules are designed to give an incentive to lone parents to seek maintenance payments to improve their household income position, while ensuring that families in that situation have access to the appropriate levels of rent supplement to meet their accommodation needs.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of her full entitlement to rent supplement based on her income from one-parent family payment and maintenance. If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the HSE she can appeal the decision to the HSE Appeals Office.

This is a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.However, the Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, is responsible for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  There are 51 MABS companies providing money advice, free of charge, to clients operating from 65 locations around the country, as well as the National Traveller MABS which operates on a national basis.  In addition, MABS National Development Limited (NDL) is funded by the CIB to provide a national support and development service to local MABS companies.Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.The MABS money advisers provide assistance, advice and intense support to people who have financial difficulties.  The money adviser works out a budget and negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors, including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the clients in managing the repayment of their debts.  Where required by the client, the money adviser can assist with setting up a special account with a local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money adviser makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client.  In 2009 some 2,618 special accounts were set up with the local Credit Unions.I am satisfied that MABS provides a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received back in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 3 July 2010 and the appeal will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals. In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.  They work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VEC, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  In addition they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme, and the short term enterprise allowance scheme of the department.The facilitator service is available locally to all social welfare recipients via the Department's Office. Facilitators are assigned to cover a geographical area.  They hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office, the employment support section or by other agencies.The service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme. Additional facilitators have been appointed during 2009 and 2010.  It is envisaged that there will be 70 facilitator posts provided for under the Plan.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-30 00:00:00	Prelude	926	The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 — 2008 established the Building Energy Rating (BER) scheme under which a BER certificate must be obtained whenever a dwelling is commissioned or is subject to an offer for sale or letting.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), as the designated issuing authority under the regulations, is responsible for the day to day administration of the BER scheme.  The assessment of buildings must be carried out by independent BER assessors who are registered with SEAI.  The latest figures from SEAI indicate that some 141,601 BER certificates have issued in respect of both domestic and non-domestic buildings since the regulations were first introduced.  In broad terms, a total of —  50 BER certificates issued in 2007; 3,068 issued in 2008; 89,584 issued in 2009; while a further 48,899 issued up to the end of August this year.While the requirement for a BER certificate was introduced for new dwellings with effect from 1 January 2007, a transitional planning-related exemption applied in the case of dwellings for which planning had been applied for prior to 31 December 2006 subject to substantial completion by 30 June 2008.  The overwhelming majority of housing completions for 2007 and 2008 would have benefited from this exemption as indicated by the low number of BER certificates issued in those years.

My Department considers whether heritage properties might be acquired, on behalf of the State, where exceptional circumstances apply. In principle, normal planning procedures and legislation should be used to give adequate protection to the special interest of a heritage property without the need for State acquisition, in particular, in the current fiscal climate. In the case of Bellamont Castle, this principle applies and acquisition is not considered appropriate.

In the case of non-petroleum minerals, there is no production from the Irish offshore at present so there would be no yield from such a levy.  Furthermore, as there are no identified reserves or resources of non-petroleum minerals in the Irish offshore, no estimate can therefore be made of any return to the State if such a levy were applied, and any such estimate would be fraught, depending on estimates of factors such as those set out above.In the case of petroleum, the only existing production is off Cork (Kinsale/Seven Heads) where annual production volumes for 2011 are estimated at 11.5 billion cubic feet.  The value of this gas will depend on the price agreed between the producer and its customers.

The objective of the Retrofit Programme is to deliver energy efficiency upgrades to one million residential, public and commercial buildings in Ireland.  It will be a programme of scale, involving energy supply companies, energy services providers, construction workers, energy auditors and policymakers, working together to deliver energy savings, cost reductions and ultimately smaller carbon footprints for energy customers.The programme will build on the success of the existing energy efficiency programmes including the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES) as well as the programmes for the public sector and industry.The Programme will, among other innovative approaches, require energy companies to promote and deliver energy efficiency measures and services to their customers.It will also introduce new ways in which householders are incentivised to invest in energy efficiency, which will support and drive the necessary behavioural change by consumers while also underpinning the maintenance and growth of the energy services and building sectors.A public consultation process has just concluded on the new Retrofit Programme.  Over 50 submissions have been received which are being reviewed as part of finalising the details of the Programme.A programme of information events, workshops and seminars is also being undertaken by SEAI with key stakeholders, which is informing the finalisation of the Programme.

These numbers are published on the Department's website.  The use of a lo-call number is appropriate for persons who do not have access to free national call services and it affords considerable savings to such persons and is considered to be best practice in terms of customer communications.  Persons who have an entitlement to free national calls can of course ring the main Department number for free.The operation of the lo-call system is a matter for the service provider concerned and not one in which I have a function.  However, the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg) has information on its website www.comreg.ie regarding the system: Document Number 08/02 of 2 January 2008 –‘National Numbering Conventions' and Document Number 10/60 of 4 August 2010 –‘Sixth Review of National Numbering Conventions'

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.Earlier this year Phase 3 of a comprehensive assessment of new towns not already connected to the national gas network was completed by BGE Networks on behalf of Gaslink.  The assessment, which included Cootehill, analysed 39 towns in terms of each town's estimated demand for gas, forecasted population growth, anticipated rise in industrial/commercial activities and the required infrastructure to meet the demand.  This was approved for publication by the CER following detailed economic analysis based on the criteria outlined in the CER's Connection Policy.  The assessment concluded that the cost of bringing gas to Cootehill was uneconomic.Gaslink continues to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the development of a new large scale industrial facility.  I am advised that the company in question has initiated discussions with Gaslink with a view to obtaining a direct gas connection to their facilities.

The person in question wishes to slaughter a number of cattle but does not have the passports of three of the animals which belonged to a herd owned by a sibling, now deceased.  He has recently applied to my Department for the transfer of the ownership of the herd into his own name.  An official from my Department met with the person named on 29 September 2010 to assist with this application.  Following this meeting, a replacement passport will issue shortly in respect of one animal.  The person named has been advised to register the birth of a second animal at which point a replacement passport can also issue.  There is an outstanding query in relation to a third animal which must be resolved before the animal can be slaughtered.

The whole focus of Government policy on banking since 2008 has been to return the banks to a position where they can access funds and lend these funds on to viable businesses and households to support enterprise growth and economic recovery.In developing any further initiatives, it would be important that they would complement, rather than substitute, the main banks' lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and also that there would be value for money from the taxpayer's perspective.Loan guarantee schemes can be designed to address known credit market failures for viable firms, such as low collateral or lack of market knowledge on the part of the lender.  My officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás to address these issues for viable SMEs including the option of a loan guarantee scheme.  Substantial progress has been made in identifying the critical elements involved in any further initiatives.

These 21 recommendations related, directly or indirectly, to five Government Departments.  The Government has reviewed the progress made by these Government Departments in responding to the 21 recommendations and a Government Statement to this effect issued in April 2010.  I intend to bring to Government twice-yearly updates on the implementation of these and any further recommendations made by the Competition Authority.Since the October 2009 commitment contained in A Renewed Programme for Government, the Competition Authority has issued one report — in two parts — containing two recommendations.  The report relates to GP services and of the two recommendations one has already been implemented with the remaining one currently being progressed.In relation to the National Competitiveness Council, the Annual Competitiveness report 2010, published by the NCC in July this year, acknowledged that since January 2008, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost at the start of the global economic downturn.  The improvement in competitiveness is closely linked to the policies the Government has pursued to restore stability to the economy.The NCC recommendations cover a range of shorter and longer term priorities, and require implementation by a range of Government Departments and agencies.  The Government is continuing to drive the competitiveness agenda across the economy, in particular through the work of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal, with a view to progressing those recommendations in order to promote a business environment that is conducive to creating jobs and securing future export-led growth for our enterprise economy.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 17 June 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved significantly and claims dating from February 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.  My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I would also point to the fact that in the eight-month period up to the end of August 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 51,800, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (26,405) which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year 2009 (50,664).Currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding eight-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.  The claims backlog which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009 has been reduced to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of advice services and non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to them prospective project promoters are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the board.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ie.

So far this year, Enterprise Ireland has paid out over €9 million to client companies in South Dublin including Tallaght.  The agency has been actively engaged with its client companies in the region and has a number of supports and initiatives in place to assist them including grants to industry, Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, technology acquisition grants, management development, seed and venture capital funds, research and development funds, jobs expansion fund and several others.Business growth and job creation are inherent considerations in the activities of the South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) in promoting and developing indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulating economic activity and entrepreneurship in South Dublin, which includes the Tallaght area.  The forms of financial assistance available include priming grants, expansion/development grants and feasibility/innovation study grants.  During 2010, South Dublin CEB has continued to assist micro-enterprises throughout the area by both direct grant aid to eligible businesses and also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice designed to help stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and to boost employment creation.Currently, there are 482 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Dublin City and County employing more than 47,000 people.  More than 2,500 new jobs have been created by new and existing IDA-supported companies in Dublin City and County to date in 2010.  Through its network of overseas offices, IDA is actively promoting Tallaght and South Dublin to potential overseas investors.  There have been a number of visits by potential investors, some which are expected to come to fruition this year.  In addition, IDA Ireland works closely with its existing client companies in South Dublin, encouraging them to take on additional valued added activities and to expand their operations in the county.  In May of this year, SAP commenced recruitment of 75 additional jobs at its City West facility, bringing the employment figure to over 1,000 at the campus.Tallaght and South Dublin are well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle and a third level Institute of technology at Tallaght.I can assure the Deputy that the enterprise development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are working hard to attract and develop employment and investment opportunities for Tallaght and the surrounding area.
