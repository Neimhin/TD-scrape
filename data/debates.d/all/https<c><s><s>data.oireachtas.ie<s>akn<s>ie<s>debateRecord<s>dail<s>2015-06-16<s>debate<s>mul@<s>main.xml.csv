#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	In January 2014, an independent expert panel was established to oversee the integrity of the process being undertaken by EirGrid to report on comprehensive, route-specific studies of overhead and underground options for both the Grid Link and Grid West projects. While the North-South transmission line project is outside the panel's terms of reference, the panel did agree, on foot of a request by my predecessor, to provide an opinion on the compatibility of the methodologies employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects with what had already been done on the North-South project up to and including 2 May 2014, being the date that the panel decided to examine the North-South project. Having considered and discussed all of the material, the panel issued a statement on 1 July 2014, indicating its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what had already been done on the North-South project is compatible with the methodologies being employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects. On 27 March last, EirGrid published a discussion paper regarding its new independently peer-reviewed draft development strategy which seeks to achieve an optimal balance between the competing demands of publicly consulting on necessary network development, choosing the best emerging technology options for that development and minimising new build. The draft development strategy found that there remains a clear need for the North-South transmission line and that the existing proposal for a 400 kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project. I understand that EirGrid lodged the planning application for the project with An Bord Pleanála on 9 June. Accordingly, I do not intend to comment further on the details of that application while the planning process takes its course. Following submission of any final application to An Bord Pleanála in respect of the EirGrid projects, a further consultative process will be open to interested parties. Section 182A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the making of submissions regarding an application for consent with respect to a development comprising electricity transmission infrastructure. A timeframe of not less than six weeks of public consultation is provided for under the section.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I understand that in relation to the North-South project, submissions or observations in respect of the application for planning approval may be made to An Bord Pleanála during the ten-week period of statutory public consultation which will commence today.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	The chairman of the Commission for Energy Regulation and his colleague from Northern Ireland appeared before the Oireachtas committee this morning. They outlined the importance of the North-South interconnector and the fact of it being of mutual interest for European funding and so forth. They also outlined clearly why the project is so necessary on an all-island basis. In addition, evidence was given by EirGrid to the Oireachtas committee a number of weeks ago that it is possible to put the cables of the North-South interconnector underground. Prior to this we were always informed that it was not feasible and, with respect to engineering, could not be done. On this occasion, however, the representatives admitted that it was possible to put it underground. Given the evidence to the Oireachtas joint committee this morning about the strategic nature of the project and its benefits for all of the island, if it is of such importance it should be put underground. That appears to be the issue for everyone concerned. Why must the people of Monaghan and Meath have these monstrosities forced upon them? The Minister should look at the evidence EirGrid gave to the joint committee, look at the evidence given to the committee this morning and make a decision once and for all to put these cables underground.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	Given that the planning process is under way for the North-South project, submissions or observations in respect of the application for planning approval may be made to An Bord Pleanála during the ten-week period of statutory public consultation which begins today. It is open to the Deputy and members of the public to make submissions on that planning application for consideration by An Bord Pleanála. I am not aware of the discussion that took place this morning at the committee but I am aware of some deliberations on this by the committee on a previous occasion, because the Deputy raised it in the House on the previous occasion. I do not wish to trespass into the engineering issues, not being an expert in them, but the question of feasibility, in other words whether it is physically possible to do something, is one issue, and whether it is the correct approach to take is another. It may be possible but it might not necessarily be the optimal approach. I offer that distinction between the two different approaches to the same issue.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	EirGrid has admitted that it is feasible from a technical and engineering point of view. It is possible to do it. It had previously bandied about costs that were 30, 20 and three times the overground cost. It is now down to 1.57 times that cost. We should bear in mind the importance of the project and the impact it will have on the people of Meath, Monaghan and Cavan. I realise the project is now before An Bord Pleanála and I do not expect the Minister to comment on the planning issue, but surely to God decisions must be taken at this juncture.It is incorrect to put the cables overground and correct to put them underground. Surely to God the Government, or a government, is elected to make the correct decisions. What is occurring is almost like building a three-storey monstrosity where a single storey would do. The proper approach is to put the cables underground. It is wrong to proceed to planning and put the cables overground. They need to be put underground. The Government needs to consider the facts and, having got the advice from the experts, say it is possible to do this and that it is the right thing to do.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	EirGrid is the statutory agency with responsibility for this project and the grid across the country. It has made a proposal to the board and set out certain options. It has said the option under discussion is the optimal one and has set out the scientific and other evidence that underlies the conclusion it came to. However, it is now up to An Bord Pleanála. It is open to citizens in the course of the planning process to scrutinise and delve into their various issues and concerns, including the question of whether other options were sufficiently or properly examined.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The Government’s strategy on affordable energy highlights how addressing energy poverty is a critical whole-of-government responsibility. To that end, my Department offers energy efficiency upgrades that are free of charge to households that are at risk of energy poverty. I introduced a new scheme in 2014 that requires the main energy suppliers to deliver annual energy efficiency savings, a certain proportion of which must be in the energy poverty sector. Other Departments are also proactive in tackling energy poverty, including the Department of Social Protection, through its income supports for those in energy poverty, and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, which offers a range of supports through local authorities.  While energy poverty will of course be an important element of the forthcoming White Paper, there will also be a new Government strategy on affordable energy published in the autumn of this year. This strategy will be informed by the results of the engagement on the consultation paper on affordable energy published earlier this year. The aim of the strategy will be to focus on a small number of high-impact actions. I intend to make progress on those actions over the next three years with a view to tackling energy poverty to maximum effect. As I noted in the consultation paper on affordable energy, ensuring that there is an adequate level of oversight and accountability will be critical to our efforts in combating energy poverty, and I would welcome engagement with the Oireachtas committees in this regard. I note that the Deputy made a submission on the affordable energy consultation paper and I very much welcome his interest and active engagement.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister. Those of us who are out meeting people know that, in very many circumstances, there are still people who face a choice between heating and eating. The financial supports for energy have not kept pace with the increasing costs of energy. We need to examine further the issues of retrofitting, solar energy panels on houses, building standards and planning controls. Will the Government's strategy on affordable energy take into account the absence of a European focus on energy poverty? There is a considerable focus on energy companies and Government strategy but not so much on energy poverty. We have to come up with a solution whereby the poorest can afford to keep warm.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	As I stated, I appreciate the Deputy's interest and insights on this issue. I agree with him that this is an area in which we need to continue with our efforts. We need to increase our efforts in order to have a policy that addresses this undoubted issue. The Deputy mentioned solar panels and retrofitting. There have been initiatives in this regard. I was involved in announcing some community-based initiatives with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland just last week. I am interested in the Deputy's point on the absence of a European focus. I have heard him make that point here before. It is, perhaps, a reasonable enough insight. I was at a meeting of energy Ministers last week in Luxembourg where I raised with colleagues this question and the importance of there being an agenda item or focus on energy poverty.He is right and I appreciate his insights. It is certainly something that is a major priority for me, as will be seen when I publish the affordable energy strategy later in the year.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The point I made about the EU is that we have copious documentation about the wider energy issues, including the press for renewable energies and the policy of reducing CO2 emissions output. Sometimes this can have a cost impact on consumers. We must protect those at risk of fuel poverty in all those discussions. I do not see the same emphasis on the cost poverty element of it. I would like to see as much discussion, debate and decision-making in that area as there are in the other areas, welcome as they are.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I take the point. As we migrate to a decarbonised economy here and elsewhere in Europe, we must always remember that there is a cost associated with these changes. Those costs must be discharged, regardless of whether it is directly from the Exchequer or from the consumer, industry or business. The cost must land somewhere in the system and the economy. The Deputy makes a fair point that there should be protections to ensure those at greatest risk and those who are vulnerable do not have to face a disproportionate cost given too many people struggle with their bills. I take the Deputy's point, which is a good one.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Does the Minister agree that there is a case to be made for the State to subsidise the connection for business premises to metropolitan area networks where the commercial case is not there for e-net, which is managing it, and where e-net has, therefore, decided that it will not make the connections?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The State-owned metropolitan area networks, MANs, have played an important role in driving competition in the regions and have facilitated large and small retail service providers operating in a fully liberalised market in providing high-speed broadband services without having to build their own networks. The MANs provide a link between national backhaul networks and the so-called last mile access networks that deliver telecommunications services to citizens and businesses. The 88 MANs, which cover 94 regional towns and cities, are managed, maintained, marketed and operated under a concession by a management services entity, MSE. The MSE provides fibre-based services and products to licensed telecommunications operators on a wholesale, open access basis. The MSE operates on a commercial basis and the cost of connecting to the MAN must be recovered by the MSE. The MSE works with operators to encourage them to use the MANs to provide downstream services. The decision, however, to avail of the MANs is ultimately based on the operator's own commercial business case. Under EU state aid rules, the State can intervene only in cases of clear market failure. Any question of subsidising connections to the MANs would come within the area of state aid. The current focus of policy is to deliver high-speed broadband services through a State-led intervention in the broadband market where market failure has been demonstrated. The proposed intervention will not be targeted at any individual operator or infrastructure. Instead, minimum service standards will be determined and operators such as e-net may bid to provide the infrastructure to deliver those services.  The mapping exercise under the national broadband plan shows that all MANs towns will have access to commercial high-speed broadband by the end of 2016. In this regard, under EU state aid rules, the State cannot further subsidise services in these areas. While take-up of the MANs by service providers was slow in the initial stages in part because the MANs were ahead of their time, the MSE has worked with service providers to enable them to connect to the MANs in a cost-effective manner and take-up has improved significantly over recent years.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House 
 The number of connections to the MANs has more than doubled in recent years and more than 60 service providers are using the MANs infrastructure. It is estimated that in excess of 600,000 individuals and business users currently benefit from the MANs infrastructure. These end customers include industrial estates, multinationals, SMEs, State entities and educational institutions, as well as fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin. While two of the 88 MANs - Banagher and Knock – are not currently in use, they are available and ready to meet demand for services as they arise. Demand for bandwidth continues to increase exponentially with the development of the digital economy, and this increase is expected to continue. As service providers bring optical fibre closer to their end users to meet this demand, the MAN networks are well-placed to serve the needs of service providers and their end users throughout their regional footprint for the foreseeable future.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	The State paid a lot of money a few years ago to put these fibre loops in the ground and then passed over management to connect them to a commercial entity called e-net. E-net's position is that if it can make money out of connecting them, it will do so but if it cannot make money out of connecting them, it will not do so. There is a lot of fibre in the ground that e-net has said it will not connect up because it will not make any money out of it. Two of them are in Wicklow but they are throughout the country. There is a loop in the Kilcoole-Newtownmountkennedy-Greystones area and one in Blessington. Businesses are screaming out for broadband connectivity and fibre connectivity. The State has put public money into putting this fibre outside the premises.Now, however, a commercial entity is stating it is not making any money out of doing the final bit of the connection. The same case for using State money to put the fibre in the ground applies to connecting the fibre to businesses. There are going to be several places where the national broadband plan will not supersede this. I ask the Minister to go back and take a look at the logic of the State paying money to put fibre in the ground. It is insufficient for the State to take a hands-off approach by saying if e-net can make money out of it, fine; if it cannot make money out of it, that is also fine. That is not fine; therefore, I ask the Minister to work with his Department in looking at this issue on a case by case basis and, in particular, at the two cases in the area I represent. What is the commercial gap? In Blessington, for example, it may be €10,000, in which case it should be provided immediately.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	There are constraints on State intervention and in funding or subsidising activity other than in circumstances where there is clear market failure, as the Deputy is well aware. That said, he raises an interesting issue about infrastructure that is already in place and asks if it is being used in the way intended for which funding was provided. I take his point. As I said in my introductory remarks, from what I can see, having prepared the response to this question, most, if not all, of the areas covered by the metropolitan area networks, MANs, are in the so-called blue area under the national broadband plan. Therefore, the expectation and the assurance is that the commercial sector will provide high-speed broadband in all of these homes and premises by the end of 2016. In that context, we must decide what is the best and most appropriate intervention. Should we make a new state aid application on the basis of a perceived market failure related to the MANs or should we proceed with the national broadband plan? The Deputy raises a very interesting question and I am very happy to engage with him further on it. I will do as he asks and take a closer look at the issue to which he has referred, particularly as it affects County Wicklow. He makes a fair point and I will be happy to discuss it further with him on another occasion.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	The national broadband plan aims to ensure every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. In tandem with commercial developments, intensive work is under way in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the country-wide introduction of next generation broadband access. On 24 November last, a public consultation process on a national high speed coverage map, 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at www.broadband.gov.ie. It allows all members of the public to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. The coverage map was produced following an intensive engagement between my Department and the industry.  The intervention area includes over 700,000 premises. Eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 with fibre-to-the-premises technology. My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from eircom concerning these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts on the proposed intervention area, the so-called amber area.. The publication of the coverage map and consultation are necessary to ensure the State intervention does not compete with commercial high speed broadband services as required under EU State aid guidelines. The publication of the aforementioned map was required under the same guidelines. Formal notification will be made after consultation on the intervention strategy is completed later this year. In the meantime, the Department continues to liaise closely with the EU Directorate General for Competition on a range of issues related to the strategy and we are on target to submit pre-notification to the directorate over the summer period.  Intensive design and planning work is under way in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the amber area. Following a public consultation process on the draft intervention strategy this summer, I hope to move to the formal procurement phase towards the end of the year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016 and it will take between three and five years to fully complete, depending on the details of the bid or bids selected.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	The Minister made reference to eircom which he said "may" reach a further 300,000 premises. The issue with regard to the areas not covered by broadband is that officialdom is constantly using terms such as "may" and "might". There is enormous frustration, but I do not propose to discuss that issue in the Chamber today because I have been talking about it ad nauseam for quite some time.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources website states:The Department has continued its regular engagement with the European Commission throughout May. Further meetings are planned for June, following which, the formal State Aid Pre-Notification is expected to be submitted to DG Competition.People living in communities without broadband services have looked at every aspect including wireless and tried every way of getting broadband to their home or business. We have all heard anecdotal evidence of people holding the laptop at a different angle and everything else.

#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The Deputy can come back in.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Any of the timeline indications I have given to the House have so far been maintained. The Deputy is right in saying that the big hard stops will be the procurement process late in the year, in November and December. The next stage is to bring the intervention strategy to Cabinet, I hope in July, the pre-notification process to DG Competition and then to get on to the procurement application by the end of the year. That is what I said when I came into this office and I am still confident I can achieve that. People's frustrations are understandable and legitimate, particularly when they can see the services others have near them, perhaps in the next town, and they compare what they could have with what they have. There is an element of me having to say that we ask people to keep faith with this process. It is a very big operation to have an intervention to cover a huge proportion of the land mass of the State in order to deliver high-speed broadband. We can and will do it, but it will take time to do it properly. Hardly a day passes without me having some engagement with senior colleagues in the Department to ensure the process is driving on, and driving on it is.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	As somebody said to me at a recent meeting on this, if we had the European Commission and all these procurement rules and regulations back in the 1940s and 1950s, it might have taken a generation to bring electricity to the people. That is the frustration for individuals and businesses. The Minister mentioned November and December, which is a nine-week period. Is it set in stone that the procurement will be advanced during that period? We are still talking about 2016, 2017 or 2018 probably before these areas are connected to what is essentially a quality of life issue at this point. At various meetings I have outlined what the Minister has told me on the floor of the Dáil. People are asking what we can do to move this on because it is a case of live horse and get grass. Why can we not get the Commission to look at the frustrations? In addition to the broadband issue, there is also the mobile telephone service.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I thank the Deputy.

Is that timeline set in stone? Is there any commitment on how long that phase will take?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	That is my intention. I can say in good faith to the Deputy that nothing has changed since the last time we had this engagement in the House that would make me believe there would be any issue with November-December. In other words, what I know now, I knew the last time we had this conversation here. We are on course to get to procurement by the end of the year, November-December, as I indicated some months ago. I recently looked at some state-aid notifications and they may be of some interest to the Deputy. For example, a Danish state-aid application in June 2012 took five months to approve. An Italian one in June 2012 took six months. A British one in the same month took ten months.A French one in July 2010 took 15 months. Another Danish one in February 2010 took five months. A Polish one in July 2011 took four months and a German one in July 2011 also took four months. My hope is that the Irish application will be processed within a few months. One never knows when submitting an application to the Commission exactly when one is likely to get a response. If the work is done in advance, including the prenotification process by way of attendance at the early meetings to pre-notify of what can be expected, which is what we propose to do over the next couple of months, it makes it much easier to get the final application through quickly.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	Postal services play an important communications role, serving the needs of domestic and business customers alike. However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change with migration towards electronic communications, resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year. It is Government policy that An Post remain a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices in the community. The post office network has many strengths and can play an important role in the communications sector into the future. For example, it has the largest retail network in the country and was fully computerised some years ago. As a result, it can fill a vital role in the nationwide provision of over-the-counter services to the public, State services and other financial and commercial transactions. In recognition of the changing commercial environment, I established the Post Office network business development group in January of this year to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network, as well as identifying new business opportunities for the network. I am firmly of the opinion that the work of the group is key to supporting the future sustainability of the network, which point I made to the postmasters at their annual meeting on 3 May last. The initial report of the group, published today, will now be opened up to consultation, the results of which will contribute to the final report in due course. I envisage a strong future for the post office network, through utilisation of its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of government, financial and other services. 
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I look forward to reading the report in detail. I understand that all Departments were party to the Post Office network business development group, including and, perhaps primarily, the Department of Social Protection. I have received correspondence from various post offices, the most recent from the post office in beautiful Easkey, County Sligo, which is on the Atlantic coast. The correspondence included a form issued by the Department of Social Protection, which states:The Department recommends direct payment to your current, deposit or savings account in a financial institution. This is the best payment option for you, as you can receive your payment at a time and place that suits you. The account must be in your name or jointly held by you.That is active encouragement of people to move from the post offices to one of the banks, which works directly against what should have been the objective of the working group.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I understand that the Department of Social Protection recently amended its old age pension application forms to reorder the list of payment options available to new beneficiaries, putting EFT payment first and relegating payment via the post office second. This is because electronic payment is often more convenient for recipients, as well as being cheaper for the Department to process. I understand that the revised form was sent to An Post for distribution at post offices and that this is a requirement under its contract with the Department of Social Protection. I further understand that this has attracted criticism from the Irish Postmasters Union. The form is for use by new recipients only so that the impact will not be significant, at least not initially given that the majority of new benefit recipients choose to receive their payments via EFT through the banking system.I am advised that this move by the Department of Social Protection is in line with its move towards electronic payments, as there is a significant cost saving associated with such payments relative to over-the-counter cash transactions.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The Department of Social Protection payments constitute up to one third of the business of post offices and without that business, post offices will close. If people are not going in to do business, they will close. Did the development group consider the possibility of EFT capability within the post office network? I agree that we cannot be like Canute in holding back the tide with a rake. However, we must support this accessible network in delivering a public service. It does more than deliver post. It is a network of accessible offices in prime position to provide public, commercial and semi-commercial services, but it needs to be developed if it is to do this. Are we looking at ways and means of ensuring post offices within the network can carry out EFT transactions in the short to medium term?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	That is exactly one of the things we need to do and it is uppermost in our minds. The shift towards electronic payments, as recognised by the IPU, needs to be made to enable the post office network to compete with the banks and in order that the post office network can be as good in transacting this business as any other outlet. The Deputy is right in that regard. This illustrates the importance of the business development group and its interim report which was published today. Among the areas outlined in the report in terms of potential include over-the-counter transaction services for new products such as BillPay on behalf of various organisations and tax payment services for the local property tax on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners. New services for Departments could also be provided such as client identity authentication services, back office and outsourcing services such as those provided by An Post for the Revenue Commissioners, as well as banking and other financial services such as those provided by An Post on behalf of AIB. We want to ensure An Post can provide these services in an efficient way and in the way people nowadays want to avail of them.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	In this question I ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for an outline of the discussions he has had with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the new planning guidelines.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	The wind energy development guidelines provide guidance for planning authorities on planning for wind energy projects by ensuring consistency of approach in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy developments and the treatment of planning applications throughout the country for such developments and assisting developers and the wider public in considering wind energy development. The current guidelines have been in place since 2006. In December 2013 the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government began a review of the existing guidelines. The review of the guidelines is set against the backdrop of the need to tackle global warming, reduce Ireland's reliance on fossil fuels and meet Ireland’s legally binding EU and international obligations, including in regard to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and the generation of renewable energy, as well as real and legitimate concerns about the impact of essential energy infrastructure on local communities. The review focuses on the specific issues of noise, proximity and shadow flicker. All other sections of the existing guidelines are to remain in place. Submissions were received from around 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period. This is a very technical area and the engagement between the two Departments is ongoing.Technical studies have been obtained on various aspects of the issues involved, particularly noise, including separation distance, and detailed assessments of various options have been undertaken by the two Departments. Revisions to the guidelines following the conclusion of deliberations will be introduced by issuing the revised guidelines to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	When are the guidelines likely to be issued? On wind energy, what is happening is that the technology has improved dramatically in terms of the height of wind turbines. In the case of current planning applications, wind turbines are approximately twice the size of those dating back to 2004 and 2005. There is considerable concern across the country and in any community I have been in about the impact of wind turbines on houses and the value of property, in addition to quality of life issues such as flicker and noise. The community in Rockchapel in north Cork is concerned about interference with the television transmission service. Something must be done as a matter of urgency. It causes frustration that while the discussions are ongoing with the Department, wind energy projects developers are applying for planning permission under the old guidelines in anticipation of a major change in the new guidelines and these projects will be developed when the new guidelines are in place. There is real urgency. Will the Minister indicate when the directives will be issued to planning authorities?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	Work and analysis are ongoing in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the review of wind energy guidelines. No firm decisions have yet been taken, but it is hoped to finalise the review in the very near future. I understand the concerns the Deputy has raised about the perceived impact in terms of noise, shadow flicker and property prices. We must take carefully into account issues of concern raised by citizens and local communities. We must also examine the issue in the context of energy policy. We have an energy policy in place and adopted a national commitment, but there are also legally binding international requirements to migrate to renewable production of energy. Onshore wind generation has been the most cost effective means by which we can migrate to renewable energy production. That is also another aspect of the issue that we must take on board.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Does "the very near future" mean days, weeks, months or years?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I do not wish to mislead the Deputy or anybody in the House, nor would I, in suggesting it is days or weeks, but the matter is being actively considered by the two Departments with a view to publication of the guidelines by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. That will give the Deputy an understanding of the issue.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	CDM Smith, a company that has led the fracking industry into Poland and Ukraine, is leading the EPA's research project on fracking. It is a little worrying that such a company would be given the job. The company's official line on natural gas is that "It is an abundant, reliable, clean and cost-effective fuel source." Surely, someone else should examine the matter?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I thank the Deputy for his question which relates to a motion passed by Leitrim County Council. While I have received communication from the county council, as outlined in the Deputy's question, I would comment as follows on the appointment of CDM Smith and the involvement of that company in the multi-agency trans-boundary programme of research commissioned by the EPA on the potential impacts on the environment and human health of unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects.The programme is managed by the EPA and co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, with oversight from a broad-based steering committee that includes my Department. As is normal in major and broad-ranging projects such as this, the project team involves a wide range of expert institutions and companies. CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research, and the consortium includes the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast, Amec Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. The contract for the programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the CDM Smith headed consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. I am aware that there has been some recent focus on the fact that CDM Smith has provided expert advice to oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. CDM Smith has also provided advice to State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is common that a broad range of parties will seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	Although I do not doubt CDM Smith's experience in the area and I understand why people would garner some information from it my point remains the same. The company is involved seriously at the coalface of fracking and would almost promote it. Recently, New York State changed its fracking moratorium into a full ban based on its department of health's review of the latest evidence. CDM Smith's response to this effort by state legislators to protect their drinking water, clean air, the global climate and the public health of their communities was one of condemnation. These people have a vested interest in telling us fracking is good for us. The Minister does not need to have fracking researched. There is enough research to prove to most ordinary people that fracking is bad for our health. A couple of months ago, a Minister said to me here that we were burying our heads in the sand if we ignored the energy potential from fracking. It might not be a bad idea if we did, given that our health would be much better.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I do not know who said that. It was not me.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	It was someone from the Minister's party who had the job before him.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	While I understand what the Deputy is saying, I respectfully disagree with him when he says there is no need to have the matter researched. We should have it researched here and have expert scientific evidence available to us in this jurisdiction. That is why the EPA has commissioned the study. The science is critical and there is a consortium of parties involved - I read out the list - including reputable, scientific institutions and universities. There is also legal advice and advice across the board so the Parliament and Government can have the best scientific evidence available to us. Evidence is evidence, not opinion. Evidence is about the science, and I would like to see the science as, I am sure, would the Deputy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	Some science experts are climate change deniers and are well-known and are perceived to be very knowledgeable. People can form opinions and very often, sadly, some people have a vested interest in the opinion they form, even if it is based on so-called expert research. Natural gas is a fossil fuel which produces heat-trap carbon dioxide when combusted as well as generating other global warming emissions. At every stage of the fracking process there are methane leaks, and methane is more than 30 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. I am even more worried about the water table.We already have enough problems with the water table which I believe are directly linked with the high rate of cancer in Ireland. The water table has been poisoned in many areas and the incidence of cancer is on the increase. The rate in Ireland is five times that in Italy. The water table presents a serious problem and fracking would only add to it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	We will have to part company on the science. Perhaps I am naive, but I think the science stands on its own. Scientific evidence is important to policy making. As a policy maker, the Minister of the day will make a decision based on the best available advice and evidence and will come to the House to account for it. It will be at least another year before the EPA's findings emerge. We should have confidence in ourselves, as a people, a Government and a Parliament to make the right decision. The scientific evidence will assist us in that regard. Like the Deputy, I keep abreast of the experience of fracking in other countries. I am aware of the changes introduced in New York. The correct process is to await the outcome of the EPA's study before determining whether there is a basis for making a decision. That is my position as Minister.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	This issue is of more than academic interest to me because I live in the area most immediately threatened by fracking. Last week the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications discussed its progress report with representatives of the EPA. I have described CDM Smith as a cheerleader for the fracking industry. My major concern is that it is the lead company for the study. How can any reasonable person expect a report to be truly independent if the lead company producing it is a cheerleader for the fracking industry? It was a bad choice as the lead company. The EPA has indicated that it signed a conflict of interest declaration. I could sign 100 documents, but I would remain implacably opposed to fracking because I know of the damage it will do. Last Friday, when the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris, attended the opening of the MacDiarmáda summer school at Seán MacDiarmáda's cottage, outside Kiltyclogher, County Leitrim, he looked out at the beautiful drumlin landscape of hills, valleys and rivers. Imagine that beautiful place covered with fracking pads. Irrespective of the health impacts, we will never be able to restore that environment if it is savaged in the cause of making money for hydraulic fracturers.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	The Deputy has noted that CDM Smith Ireland Limited and its sub-consultants signed a conflict of interest declaration as part of the tender documentation. The declaration stated it had no conflict that would impair its ability to meet the requirements as specified, whether through personal interest, current or prospective contractual obligations or any other activity or association.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. My Department is working on a new energy policy White Paper which will set out Ireland’s energy policy up to 2030. I aim to publish the White Paper in October. In regard to its energy efficiency aspects, eliminating waste and the targeting of improved energy efficiency will be key to our transition to a sustainable energy future. Through the better energy homes programme which provides grant support for householders who undertake energy efficiency improvements, 167,443 homes have undertaken energy efficiency retrofits, with a total Government investment of €174 million.Additionally, under the Better Energy Warmer Homes programme, 115,223 homes in energy poverty have received free energy efficiency improvements with a total Government investment of almost €138 million. A further 9,644 homes have received energy efficiency upgrades under the Better Energy Areas and Communities Programme, with €46.8 million of Government funds invested. In total, almost one sixth of all homes in the country have received a Government-supported energy efficiency upgrade. In March of this year, I announced an increase in the level of financial support available to householders under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme. The cash value of every grant available to householders was increased by between 25% and 50%. In addition, a bonus payment was introduced which sees householders receive a bonus payment if they complete three or more energy efficiency improvements. The minimum grant threshold was also abolished. Resourcing of measures that will be set out in the energy policy White Paper will be considered in the context of the normal budgetary discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and as the development of the White Paper is finalised over the coming months.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I thank the Minister for his reply. Retrofitting houses is certainly a good investment and any increase in the amount going towards it will certainly pay big dividends, not just for those whose houses are being retrofitted but also for society at large. It is guaranteed to reduce energy dependence. The need for such work should be assessed, particularly in rural houses many of which have non-cavity walls. We should try to gauge the scale involved in order that we can measure the percentage needed to hit the target.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I had a question on the energy area earlier. The Minister said the White Paper will be produced in September but will it include a review of the effectiveness of the Commission for Energy Regulation? I have tried to ask the Minister that question many times but the Ceann Comhairle rules it out saying it is not the Minister's responsibility. However, it clearly is the Minister's responsibility to invigilate the CER and see if it is delivering. We have almost 3,000 excess deaths each year due to fuel poverty, which affects many people. The retrofitting programme is helping but a significant number of people spend up to 10% of their income or more on fuel. Given that they are enduring fuel poverty, will the Minister re-examine the CER? In correspondence with the Minister I indicated that the mathematical model the CER uses for setting gas and other fuel prices needs to be looked at. As the Minister knows, it has been criticised in some economic journals. I have received voluminous correspondence from the CER, but a thorough invigilation of the commission should be at the heart of the Minister's White Paper.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	Retrofitting should apply to some of the old local authority estates, both urban and rural. Deputy Colreavy mentioned non-cavity walls and some of those houses were built as mass concrete buildings 50 or 60 years ago. There is a major issue of heat loss, even with some of the newer local authority housing estates that were built 25 or 30 years ago. Any retrofitting programme should apply to those houses in the first instance because it would help to deal with fuel poverty, as Deputy Broughan mentioned. Such houses need to be fully retrofitted at this stage. I have seen graphs and figures from experts in this field, which show that if a house is properly retrofitted, heat loss can be reduced by one third or even a half. It will have a big impact on fuel consumption and, consequently, energy needs.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	An extraordinary number of houses in the country have been built with 9 in. cavity walls. Such a cavity can carry damp across. The outside walls may be pebble-dashed, but it makes such a difference to those houses if a 30 mm baton is introduced on the inside, with insulation and a new slab over it.It is possible to paint over the slab. If a builder does it properly it makes the house far more snug. A 9 in. cavity was not designed to keep out the moisture or cold, yet an extraordinary number of houses have been built with 9 in. cavities. They were still at it right up to the end of the 1980s.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	Certainly Deputy Wallace's expertise is welcome and I have taken a note of what he has said. It is most helpful, as are the insights from other colleagues. As Deputy Colreavy said, it is right that we should have a sense, as best we can, of the extent of the issue. Deputy Moynihan also mentioned the point about older local authority schemes. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland does a great deal of work in this area. As I mentioned earlier, I re-launched the Better Energy Warmer Homes initiative last March. The SEAI is progressing a number of innovations which could assist in respect of the point the Deputies have made. These include the idea of a better green energy star - a quality rating system; the proposal that we should engage more with local actors, such as credit unions and local authorities and so on, to promote community level action; that we should target an advertising campaign for solar, thermal, boiler and heating controls; that we should target public relations and radio promotions in areas of low coverage - Leinster is an area of low coverage, by the way; that we should target home owners who have done shallow retrofits or those with expired applications; that we should review a declaration of works; that we should carry out a survey of expired home owner grants, and so on. These practical innovations from the SEAI would address many of the issues that have been raised in the House. I had not anticipated the question on the regulator. The regulator is an independent statutory body. If Deputy Broughan has any commentary or insights on the matter or on any aspect of our energy policy I would be happy to consider them in the context of the energy White Paper. We are getting close now, as Deputy Colreavy and Deputy Moynihan will know, because they have debated this issue in the House before. I would certainly be glad to hear any insights that the Deputies have in respect of any of these matters for the energy White Paper.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	This is much like the last question. I will try to avoid repetition, but it will be difficult. I will reiterate my point. The people who say fracking is not dangerous stand to profit from it, more often than not. A serious amount of research says otherwise. I appeal to the Minister to think seriously before even dreaming of allowing fracking to commence in Ireland. It is a no-brainer.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	There is no prospect of there being any developments in this area for quite some considerable time. The Environmental Protection Agency commissioned study is under way. It will not report before the middle of 2016. I would have thought that at that stage we would require a significant period either for me or whoever has the honour of being in this position as Minister to review and consider the matter then, as well as debate it in the House. In that sense I should reassure the Deputy. As we have said already, the research programme is managed by the EPA. It is co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. There is oversight from a broad-based steering committee that includes my Department. The consortium I mentioned earlier includes the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queen's University Belfast, AMEC, Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors. They all have expertise that they bring to the table. It will be open to those bodies to collaborate and work together on the research and evidence. Ultimately, it will be for the EPA to ensure a report is produced. In the circumstances, I believe we should allow that work to conclude. We should have confidence that it will be robust. We can evaluate the work in due course when it comes through, but not before the middle of 2016 at the earliest.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	We have a big problem in politics in how we make decisions, because we work from one election to the next. On top of that, we have an extra-large problem when it comes to addressing climate change in that none of us sees it as directing us in the near future. We do not feel it will affect us in the near future and that is a problem for us.It is an attitude that has hampered progress. The Minister pointed out that he might not be in this role in the next Government. However, he has an opportunity now to leave his mark. The country is screaming out for someone to take up a position, which the Minister can do, of saying it is about time we took climate change seriously. If he has read Naomi Klein's book, This Changes Everything, the Minister will know its contents are frightening. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill the Government is introducing is a pittance and does not address the problems we are facing in the long term. Sadly, too much of our decision-making is short-termist. We struggle to make plans for the long term whenever doing so will cost money.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I largely agree with the Deputy's comments. The problem from the point of view of political discourse is that with an issue like climate change, people too often regard it as something to be dealt with by someone else, somewhere else and at some other time. In fact, it is an issue that affects all of us, and it is already impacting our planet and must be addressed. To direct the Deputy to an indication of my bona fides on the matter, I delivered an interim presentation on 3 June on the White Paper on climate change. My speech is on the Department's website and, as I recall, I also tweeted it. I might tweet it again this afternoon. I ask the Deputy to take a look at that speech, in which I referred to some of the issues he has raised. As I said, addressing climate change is the greatest project of our time. There is no bigger issue.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	It is a huge disappointment that the Government has refused to include targets for the period from 2030 to 2050 in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill. The Scottish Parliament has introduced targets that are double ours after 2020. The Minister says he is seriously interested in this issue. I certainly will have a look at the speech to which he referred. Does he seriously maintain that the climate change Bill that is about to go through the House is good enough to deal with the challenges we face?
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The EPA report on fracking does not include consideration of an issue that will have to be taken into consideration by the political system, namely, the negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, system. Particularly under the ISDS system, energy companies will undoubtedly threaten governments. If they are not given consent even to explore, they will certainly look for the money back and may even charge governments for the potential profits they will claim they might have been able to make had permission been granted. That is a factor which must be taken into account by the political system. The EPA cannot do so because the matter is not within its brief.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I will take on board Deputy Colreavy's insights in regard to TTIP and ISDS. To answer Deputy Wallace's question, I support the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, in bringing forward the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill. That legislation constitutes progress. In fairness, however, notwithstanding its importance, it is only one element of what we need to do. The notion that putting targets into legislation would, by definition, make those targets happen is a little naive. The international targets up to 2020 are legally binding and it will be a real challenge for us to meet them. In the coming months, especially after the meeting in Paris in December, we will see the process kick in whereby individual member states are given targets for 2030. They will be very challenging and demanding targets and we are obliged to comply with them. That will require a collective effort by the whole country and the whole political system if the challenge of climate change is to be addressed properly.

I would also like to know the number of houses and businesses that do not have access to high-speed broadband. Where are we at in terms of establishing that level of need?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	The national broadband plan aims to ensure every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. I will make the reply available to Deputies rather than read it all because time is short. As they will be aware, a mapping exercise is in place. As a matter of fact, every single home and premises can be accessed and identified on the map which is interactive. Of course, it does not have a facility to count all of them, which is the issue the Deputy is raising, but we think there is something in the order of 2.3 million addresses in Ireland, approximately 1.6 million of which are expected to be served, in terms of the indications the commercial sector has given, with high speed broadband being provided by commercial companies in the next 18 months. That is the commitment which has been given by the commercial sector. I understand high speed services are available to approximately 1.2 million addresses. As the Deputy knows and as I mentioned earlier, eircom recently made a further announcement on an investment to cover a further 300,000 addresses. I can tell the Deputy that my Department is rigorously examining the assurances from eircom and other operators in respect of their plans. This is a requirement to be met by all operators. While we take seriously what the commercial sector states to us, we do not take it at face value. We look carefully at what it is stating to us in order that we can ensure the private sector will do what is commercially viable and the intervention required to be made by the State will only be made in those areas where the commercial sector will not go. We want to minimise the cost to the Exchequer and the system of the broadband plan. As I mentioned earlier to Deputy Michael Moynihan, the plan is progressing very well. We will have a full intervention strategy going to the Government in July. I hope we will be in the pre-notification process in respect of State aid rules to get to the procurement process by the end of the year.

I suggested five or six weeks ago that it would make sense to have an online system in order that, if people could not access high speed broadband, they could log the issue and the Department would have the information and a rolling count. It would be a simple, inexpensive solution to the problem. Of course, the private companies have a role to play, but members of the public are the ones who know whether they need and have access to high speed broadband. Has anything been done to develop this suggestion?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	As I understand it, the Deputy is proposing a database to monitor the availability of broadband services. It would not, in the first instance, be the responsibility of the Department. ComReg also has certain statutory duties and a role pursuant to legislation. My focus is on spreading access to high speed broadband across the country, in particular rural areas where the commercial sector ultimately will not go. I am concentrating on ensuring every home and premises in the country will have access to broadband. I am not sure setting up a database would be the best use of constrained resources in the Department, but I will take on board what the Deputy has said. It is important that we have information when we pursue these policy options.

My heart breaks for the parents who lost children this morning. I can only imagine the fear in the hearts of other parents whose children are in California this summer as they seek to contact them. The telephone number of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is (01)4180200. It is with great sadness that I confirm that a number of young Irish citizens have lost their lives, while a number of others have been seriously injured. It is truly terrible to have such a serious and sad incident take place at the beginning of a summer of adventure and opportunity for so many young people on J1 visas in the United States. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has opened its consular emergency response centre and an experienced consular team stands ready to provide all possible consular assistance for the Irish citizens affected by the this tragic incident and their families. Our consul general in San Francisco is in close contact with the authorities and will provide assistance for those affected on the ground. It is too early to know the full extent of this dreadful accident. A full investigation is under way. According to information from the local police, 13 people were on the balcony at the time of the collapse. While there is no official confirmation of the identities or nationalities of all those involved, current information suggests all of those involved are Irish. I received a call from the ambassador of the United States to Ireland, Mr. Kevin O'Malley, who had many of the young J1 visa holders in the residence in the Phoenix Park prior to their departure to the United States. He has expressed his sadness and tendered the sympathy and condolences of the people of the United States to the people of Ireland, in particular the parents and families of the young people involved.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I met with Clerys staff, suppliers and workers at midday on O'Connell Street today. I will speak in a non-partisan way on what has been a shocking, cold and callous way of closing an iconic and historic store. There is no doubt that the workers were treated in an appalling manner, as were the suppliers. Indeed, other jobs could be at risk due to the manner in which suppliers were treated, as well as the concession stores and their staff. What is happening is unethical and immoral. It speaks of a lack of respect for workers. There is an absence of decency and dignity in how this was approached. It is symptomatic of a trend, which unfortunately is gaining momentum, of consistent undermining of workers in certain sectors of the economy. We have seen it in the low-hour and zero-hour contracts and now there is this utilisation of company law and financial chicanery to engineer the closure of a company at the eleventh hour in a manner that does not facilitate the granting of the most basic entitlements to workers and all those connected to the company. Some of the staff have given 40 years of dedicated service and they deserve better than this. We are witnessing probably the worst example of vulture capitalism. Will the Taoiseach consider whether a fundamental review of our legislation is needed, in respect of both industrial relations and company law, to ensure this type of activity cannot continue? It would send a message to employers and employer organisations that we live in a society and that society demands basic respect and decency for workers. That is increasingly absent in how some employers are treating their workers. The State must intervene if it continues. The most effective intervention is legislative. Will the Taoiseach agree to review both company law and industrial relations law to ensure this type of behaviour cannot continue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I respect how Deputy Martin has raised this. The treatment of workers at Clerys, an institution for people from all over the country for over a century, was grossly insensitive and appalling. When I first heard the news, given the fact that we are making preparations for the centenary commemorations of 1916, which the Clerys building survived, and that the statue of Jim Larkin, famous for the Lock-out, is across the street, I thought it appallingly insensitive to people such as John Finn, who worked for 43 years in Clerys. He epitomised the shock and devastation that workers felt. The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Nash, has met with the liquidator to discuss the issues. The Department of Social Protection has assembled a team to meet with and advise workers about entitlements, jobseeker's payments, secondary payments such as rent supplement and future options in respect of alternative employment, training and education. Arrangements have been made with the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, to use Liberty Hall as a venue to meet with workers tomorrow, Wednesday, 17 June. The intention is that the meeting will provide information to all workers, including those employed by concession holders. Obviously, there are claims from concession holders for payments and the release of stock and its value due to them. The precise format of the meeting is yet to be finalised as workers might be involved at other meetings at Liberty Hall, but it is likely to involve the Department's team being available for referral for individuals or small groups on the day, rather than a large presentation. That facilitates better information being imparted to the workers. A representative of the liquidator has verbally advised the Department of Social Protection that all staff have been made redundant and that P45s will issue this week. It is possible that a small number of staff from the payroll section might be retained in respect of the liquidation. The liquidator will seek payment from the insolvency payments scheme, IPS, on behalf of workers in respect of unpaid wages, accrued but untaken leave and payment in lieu of statutory notice. It is intended that meetings will be held between him and individual workers to determine, on an individual basis, the extent of liabilities. The Department will deal promptly with the individual applications submitted under the IPS by the liquidator. The Department of Social Protection will also ensure that jobseeker claims will not be delayed pending the liquidator resolving individual issues in regard to any leave accrued but not taken. This means that claims in this unfortunate situation can be paid quickly, subject to the usual criteria, and reconciled as required at a future date. As Deputy Martin will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, has met with the liquidator and has advised the liquidator to meet with the workers, as will happen now. The situation in this case has been examined over the years in the context of the legislation that is in place. I do not wish to give commitments I cannot fulfil in respect of changes to legislation, but I agree with the Deputy that in Ireland in 2015 the method and insensitivity with which this was handled is not something one wishes to see.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that every effort will be made to fast-track payments to the workers affected and, in particular, their welfare entitlements. In addition, the Taoiseach might comment on the needs of suppliers. Their position is in considerable jeopardy as a result of what happened and the manner in which it happened. We would be willing to co-operate with the Government on this issue in terms of any legislative interventions that would be necessary to prevent a recurrence of this situation. That refers not just to industrial relations legislation but also company law and the manner in which the financial world can create various vehicles and scenarios effectively to absolve companies of fulfilling their moral obligations, as well as their legal obligations, to workers, suppliers and others in situations such as this. This is happening too frequently. There is a growing trend in certain sectors, particularly the retail sector, whereby workers are being consistently undermined in respect of their terms, conditions and pay. The Oireachtas cannot stand by and facilitate the continuation of this. It needs to send a very strong message. I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, said he was contemplating a change in legislation. Perhaps the Taoiseach might indicate whether the Government is preparing to examine legislation in this area.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I again thank the Deputy. There will be no delay in the processing of payments to workers affected by this outcome. The Department of Social Protection has notified all local offices in Dublin of the arrangements it is making to deal with individual claims or numbers of claims that will arise in any of these offices. The issue will be dealt with as speedily as possible. I thank the Deputy for his offer of co-operation. Obviously, a point was made by the Minister of State about the way the situation had evolved and its outcome. He will prepare a report for the Government on the suitability and efficiency of what is well tried legislation. It is the insensitivity of what has happened that has shocked most people, particularly the location in which it occurred at such short notice for staff. As indicated, Mr. Finn has given 43 years of his life to the establishment which, as the Deputy knows, was the first port of call for thousands of people from all over the country on their visits to Dublin for very many years.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The Taoiseach expressed sympathy for the Clerys workers. I have no doubt that he was sincere enough, but the Government is also partly to blame for their dilemma. We have seen it before. Workers in Waterford Crystal, TalkTalk, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, Game and others were frustrated in gaining access to basic rights and entitlements. Three years ago the Taoiseach and his partner in government, the Labour Party, rejected Sinn Féin's Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012 which sought to legislate for the scenarios in question. Had he supported that Bill, what the company did would have been unlawful. What we sought to do in the Bill was enhance the period of notice for workers made redundant and expedite the hearings and processing of claims to entitlements. One of the workers at the rally today asked me why the Government would do this and why it would not support the workers. I was asked why the Labour Party, especially, would not support them. Will the Taoiseach legislate belatedly to protect workers such as those at Clerys? For example, will he extend the period of notice legally required in collective redundancies and impose penalties for non-compliance? Will he provide a time limit within which applications for redress for employees such as those in Clerys will be heard? Will he move beyond the expressions of sympathy and introduce legislation to defend the rights of workers where employers fail to pay money due to them? In this regard, we will support him, although he has refused to support us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I thank the Deputy. As I said to him, a representative of the liquidator has verbally advised the Department of Social Protection that all of the workers involved have been made redundant and that P45s will be issued this week. That is why the Department has notified all of the local offices that claims will be processed speedily and efficiently. When one examines company law, one realises this is obviously a very complex issue and changes should not be made lightly. The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will prepare a report for the Government on all of the issues surrounding this matter. Perhaps it might be appropriate for the company law review group to examine what happened and how it evolved. That group is headed by a very capable person. The meetings that will take place in the next short period will bring to light all of the issues that evolved before this insensitive, swift action was taken following the court's decision to appoint a liquidator. The question of company law is one that, in the context of Clerys, could be examined by the company law review group which is headed by Mr. Courtney.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	Let me disagree with the Taoiseach profoundly. This is not a very complex issue. It is very straightforward and has to do with workers' rights and industrial relations. The Taoiseach mentioned Mr. John Finn whom I met today. He has worked for Clerys for 43 years and was given half an hour to clear his personal effects from the premises, in which he served loyally for all of those years. The Taoiseach also mentioned James Larkin. The rally today in support of the workers which was attended by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, other Deputies and I was held just opposite Larkin's statue. The Taoiseach will know that in 1913 Mr. Larkin addressed workers from the balcony of Clerys after they had been locked out in this city. Therefore, this is not a very complex issue. The Clerys workers were locked out. The manner in which they are being treated is appalling and unacceptable. They have families, mortgages, loans and bills to pay, just like everyone else. Riddle me this: the Boston-based Gordon Brothers Group which sold Clerys to the Natrium consortium has reputedly pocketed €19 million having put less than €2 million into the store. What is complex about this? What is difficult to understand about it? Those concerned have refused even to acknowledge the existence of the Clerys workers or anyone else connected with the company. Does the Taoiseach agree that these workers have rights and entitlements? Obviously, they must be protected, but they are not protected under law and the Taoiseach has to introduce legislation to bring them the money that is due to them. It is their money. Will he pick up the telephone today and talk to Natrium and ask it to have some basic decency and meet the workers' representatives? These workers, like the others I have listed, have been let down not only by the company bosses but also by the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	The Deputy deliberately misunderstands me. Company law legislation is very complex. The Deputy will be aware of the many hundreds of amendments made to company law Bills during the years. Company law is a complex business.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	Workers' rights.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	The issue is much more straightforward. The company was insolvent. An application was made to the High Court for the appointment of a liquidator and it was approved. The liquidator or personnel on its behalf have said all of the workers are now redundant and that P45s will be issued this week. The workers are protected under redundancy legislation, but the company is completely insolvent. A different issue arises for the concession holders in Clerys, for whom it would have managed the business, taking a fee, with the money being lodged elsewhere. Obviously, claims are in for the return of that money for the past month and the release of stock to the concession holders. In so far as the State is concerned, there is protection for the workers under the redundancy payments scheme which will click in tomorrow. Liberty Hall is being made available to advise workers of their rights and opportunities and the fact that the Department will expedite the payments to be made. The point I am making is that while company law is very complex, the question raised by Deputy Micheál Martin is one that could be considered by the company law review group when the report on all of these issues comes back from the Minister of State with responsibility for business, Deputy Gerald Nash.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	Last week we discussed the terms of reference for an inquiry into the State’s alleged preferential treatment of private sector investors in general and our good friend Mr. Denis O’Brien, in particular.That someone as rich and powerful as Denis O'Brien, who has unfettered control of much of the mainstream media, might get preferential treatment is not much of a shock to many. I do not think he is the only powerful individual or consortium who may have got favourable treatment from State-owned institutions. When NAMA was set up, the plan was that it would not flood the market with stressed assets. This was a special purpose vehicle that would await some form of recovery before maximising the assets in the interests of the taxpayer. That is not what has happened. For some strange reason, NAMA has been in a hurry to fire sale assets for less than their real value despite the fact it is a rising market. We see many of these assets being sold on at massive profits. I named a few of them in here last week. It is frightening how quickly these vulture funds have turned them over and the extent of the profits involved. This means that foreign vulture funds have won and the Irish people are losing out. Something is the matter with how NAMA has operated. Before the Taoiseach was elected to office, he said that NAMA was a secret society that needed an injection of competence, openness and transparency. He was dead right but everything stayed the same. It did not change. Sadly, the drip-feed of questionable deals has begun. If the Taoiseach does not address this now, it may come back to haunt him in years to come because I believe serious issues are at stake. Will the Taoiseach wait for this to reach a crescendo before he acts or is he prepared to commission an independent inquiry into how NAMA has worked and check whether the people got the maximum return in respect of how the assets were sold by this organisation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	The Deputy is well aware that NAMA operates under a very specific remit. It was dealing with the largest property portfolio in the western hemisphere. The Deputy made certain comments here. I point out to him that NAMA also operates under the aegis of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, some of whose personnel serve on the board of NAMA. NAMA appears regularly before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. If the Deputy has particular cases in mind concerning any deals done or decisions made by NAMA in respect of the disposal of property, he should remember that NAMA's remit is to maximise value and the return for the taxpayer and that personnel from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General serve on the board of NAMA and are quite entitled to appear before the independent watchdog in the Oireachtas, namely, the Committee of Public Accounts, as well as the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. If the Deputy has particular cases in mind, he can refer them to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy McGuinness. NAMA appears regularly before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with issues or decisions made by the board about property where its remit is to maximise the return for the taxpayer.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	It is interesting that the Taoiseach puts the onus back on me. I will give two examples. An office block on Mount Street was sold off market in 2012 by NAMA to US fund Northwood for €27 million. In 2014, Northwood sold it for €42 million. Most of the money was financed by NAMA in the first place. This is in a country where small and medium-sized businesses cannot get a cent out of financial institutions. NAMA sold the Forum building in the IFSC in 2012 to US private equity firm Atlas Capital for €28 million. Less than two years later, it was sold for €37.8 million, a 35% profit. If the Taoiseach thinks this is good business, I think otherwise. They are just two of the smaller examples. The Taoiseach does not need me to give him details. Many of the details are out there and there is a lot of stuff that is not out there because, as the Taoiseach put it four years ago, NAMA is a secret organisation. Despite the fact that it was brought under freedom of information in April, people are finding it incredibly difficult to get any information out of it. The sale of large blocks of apartments for less than it cost to build them is one of the reasons the private sector has not resumed building. There will be no serious increase in housing in this country until you build it yourselves. This is directly linked to the housing crisis and deserves investigation. The taxpayer has lost out badly and we are talking about billions. The Taoiseach did not set up NAMA but he can address the problem before it comes back to haunt him in the next term.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	I recognise that it is an offence under law to make connection with NAMA but I again point out to the Deputy that I am sure that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is utterly independent in the way it does its business. The personnel from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General serving on the board of NAMA are there for that purpose. NAMA operates under the aegis of Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and reports to the independent watchdog in this Oireachtas, the Committee of Public Accounts, and can be invited to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure to deal with cases like those referred to by the Deputy. I am not throwing the onus back on the Deputy. I am quite sure the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts will take note of what the Deputy has said here. I do not agree with him that there is no access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises. There is more access than ever before. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has set up many opportunities to avail of access to credit that were not there before and this is resulting in many more companies being set up and employment heading in the right direction. I am sure that as an employer, the Deputy knows that. The changes made by the Central Bank relating to the construction sector mean that builders must now put up 40% of the required funds instead of having 100% loans as applied previously and building on from the profit, resulting in a catastrophic situation, as happened under the previous Administration which brought the country over the cliff. The Minister for Finance has put together a number of opportunities where this matter can be addressed. Everyone understands that the supply side of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin area, is nothing like what it should be despite the fact that 20,000 more people are working in the construction sector. This needs to be greatly enhanced, which is why the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was advising local authorities in respect of their strategic development plans that if they made it too restrictive, it would become difficult to provide the quantity of housing that is required. The Central Bank introduced changes for a good reason connected with what happened previously. Access to credit and availability of credit for small and medium-sized enterprises is greater than ever before and is yielding results in terms of increased employment.

In September 2014, the Government made a number of changes to Cabinet committees during the establishment of the Cabinet committee on Construction 2020, housing, planning and mortgage arrears. This committee has met six times to date on 29 September 2014, 8 October 2014, 11 November 2014, 19 January 2015, 30 March 2015 and 25 May 2015. It has met three times in the past six months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	The Taoiseach said that the Cabinet committee on Construction 2020, housing, planning and mortgage arrears met six times over the past 12 months. He might indicate whether he agrees that far greater frequency was required given that he had originally insisted that everything was in hand in respect of the housing crisis, especially in respect of housing supply and household debt.The Taoiseach must accept that he was denying the facts until the figures reached crisis levels. There has been a 246% increase in the number of homeless families in Ireland. Over 1,000 children are in emergency accommodation in Dublin alone. We met with representatives of the Simon Community two months ago who were alarmed at the crisis in homelessness among children in particular and were very concerned about a potential fatality emerging in that area. Over the weekend we read that there has been a 30% increase in rental prices since 2010 in the Dublin area. I was on the streets of Dublin last week talking to people in various housing estates who told me of the extraordinary cost of rent which is prohibitive for many families and which is causing an enormous housing crisis.  The Cabinet committee is not doing its work. It is the driving force behind pretending to be doing something on housing but is missing its basic targets. In March, for example, the Government announced that 1,400 social housing units would be built by the end of this year. In recent weeks that target was shifted and the Government announced that 1,700 social housing units would be built by the end of 2017. In April we learned that there was a 60% fall-off in commencements of one-off dwellings in 2014 and a 25% drop in commencements generally. I ask the Taoiseach to explain what has happened and why the promises the Government made only a few months ago have already been abandoned.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the devastating impact of the mortgage arrears crisis is becoming worse by the day? The latest figures show a 50% increase in the number of enforcement cases being lodged with the courts. The Government's decision to allow the banks to control the entire process has been a complete failure, as has only been belatedly acknowledged by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. The Government has failed to take any measures at all to deal with that fundamental fact. The banks have taken State money and the low interest rates currently available but they continue to exploit mortgage customers in every way possible. Will the Government reverse that policy? Has the Cabinet committee considered giving an independent agency full control over this mounting crisis? At the heart of the flawed approach the Government took to the personal insolvency legislation and to mortgage arrears generally, in terms of any resolution mechanism, is the fact that the banks were in the driving seat and had a veto. For some reason, the Government has refused to dilute that veto.  Notwithstanding the fact that the aforementioned committee has met six times, the problem is becoming worse by the day. It is not just me saying that, organisations with long experience in the area of homelessness, like the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and others are saying that the homelessness crisis is appalling. It is alarming in terms of potential fatalities that could arise from the fact that so many children are living in hotel rooms in Dublin and across the country. Urgent action is required in that regard. The rent situation is crazy. The increases in rent and the decision to cap or reduce the rent allowance have had an appalling impact on low income families and reduced their capacity to secure suitable housing. In fact, the rent allowance is so out of touch with market rates that many cannot utilise it, with many landlords refusing to entertain it.  The aforementioned are key areas for the Cabinet committee which must meet far more frequently and must become far more effective in its interventions.

It is important to put on the record that the basis of the procedure emanates from Article 28.4.3° of the Constitution which states, "The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter".
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I have pointed out to Deputy Martin the number of times that the committee has actually met. In addition to that, every Monday morning the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, meets with a group in his Department and members of Dublin City Council to co-ordinate activities in this area. This is really a supply issue because supply ground to a halt after the economic collapse. The Minister has already made it clear he is working on a package of measures to deal with housing, including the situation concerning rent. He has already pointed out that a tenants rights campaign began this week to ensure that people are fully aware of their rights. He has already made the decision, approved by Government, that 50% of allocations in the Dublin area will go to people who are on the housing list. As Deputy Martin is aware, Threshold operates a scheme under which persons in difficulty or about to get into difficulty in respect of rent can have their case examined on an individual basis with a view to preventing them from being removed from their current accommodation and ending up on the street or as occupants of hotel rooms or bed and breakfast establishments. The real problem here is the supply of houses. That means that we cannot deal with this in a comprehensive fashion until builders are in a position to put blocks on concrete and houses on the ground. We have had discussions with the Dublin City Manager on a number of occasions as to how we can deal with this through emergency measures ranging from voids being completed, reconstruction of housing and emergency units being made available. The question of mortgage arrears is an issue but it is important to say that according to the Central Bank's figures for quarter 1 of 2015, out of 757,175 private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwellings in Ireland, 86% are not in arrears. Some 104,693 mortgages are in arrears. This figure includes arrears of one day or more and is down from a peak of 143,000 family homes in arrears. Mortgage accounts in arrears over 90 days fell for the sixth consecutive quarter in quarter 1 of 2015, with the number in arrears for over 90 days at the end of March standing at 74,395, or 9.8% of the total. Some 37,933 of those mortgages are in very long term arrears of over 720 days and although the number of accounts in long term arrears continues to rise, the pace of increase has reduced significantly in recent quarters.  More recent figures from the Department of Finance on the six main banks were published last week and represent 90% of the market. These also show that the number of principal dwelling houses in mortgage arrears has fallen. The number has declined by almost 2,000 per month and by 23% over the year since April 2014, to stand at just over 82,000 at the end of April 2015. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of over 90 days has continued to fall while those accounts in arrears of over 720 days remains steady, with a small rise of nine such accounts since March 2015. The number of accounts with no arrears has increased to just over 611,000. Central Bank figures also show an increase in the number of mortgage accounts on principal dwelling homes that have been restructured, with a year-on-year increase of just under 27% and a quarter on quarter increase of 2.3%. The figures show that 117,263 homes have had their mortgages restructured through a wide variety of restructuring options. It is worth noting that more than 85% of these are meeting their current restructuring arrangements. In terms of the six main banks, the Department of Finance figures show an increase of almost 30% since April 2014 in restructured accounts, with the total now standing at just over 57,000. The Central Bank figures show that the number of buy-to-let mortgage accounts in arrears has also continued to fall. At the end of March 2015 there were 139,206 buy-to-let mortgages, of which a total of 33,475 or 24% are in arrears. This is a decrease of almost 15% since quarter 1 of 2014 and a quarterly decrease of over 2,000 accounts.The number of accounts in arrears of more than 90 days has fallen by 5.9% quarter-on-quarter to just under 27,500. There was a marginal fall of five in the number of accounts in arrears of more than 720 days, bringing the total number to 15,361. The Department of Finance figures also show a decrease in the number of buy-to-let mortgage accounts in arrears. Of 120,513 for the six main banks, 77% are not in arrears. Of the cases dealt with by the Insolvency Service of Ireland up to the first quarter of 2015, 328 personal solvency arrangements have been agreed. While the overall numbers remain low, there is a success rate there of 72.4%.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	I wish to deal with the efficiency of this committee, which the Taoiseach has told us met six times in the past 12 months. It has responsibility for housing, planning and mortgage arrears. I listened keenly to the figures the Taoiseach produced earlier. If we judge it on results, almost four family homes are being repossessed or surrendered every day. According to Central Bank figures, 351 homes were repossessed in the first quarter of this year. Some 104,963 family homes are in mortgage arrears and that figure keeps growing. That is a real threat to the well-being, health and security of the families involved. The Central Bank figures also reveal that when the banks agree to restructuring, they increasingly rely on arrears capitalisation and split mortgages, which I am sure the Taoiseach will agree are the least fair and the least sustainable. Of course the high variable mortgage rates contribute to the overall mortgage arrears crisis. Last week the Government voted down what I considered to be a thoughtful Bill, the Central Bank (Mortgage Interest Rates) Bill 2015, tabled by Sinn Féin, which would have enabled the Central Bank to direct those banks bailed out by the State and theoretically owned by the citizens to lower or cap mortgage interest rates. I believe the Taoiseach has acknowledged that Irish home owners are paying over the odds compared with interest rates in other EU countries. The Taoiseach has said that the refusal of some banks to cut interest rates is a very serious manner and that it would not be tolerated. We are not happy, nor is it acceptable, that banks should be charging mortgage holders a much higher rate than the one at which they are able to borrow. We then measure what has been done about that. I agree with what the Taoiseach said, although it is very obvious, that the real problem leading to homelessness is with the supply of houses. I believe Fr. McVerry said about a year ago that he saw different people now becoming homeless. Unfortunately, and there but for the grace of God go all of us, some people fall into homelessness because of addiction problems, mental health problems, physical health problems or problems in their own home. However, people are now falling into homelessness simply because they cannot afford to pay the rent, particularly if a family member becomes ill or if their social welfare, including rent supplement is cut. Last month a record 71 families in the capital here presented as homeless. There are 1,000 children in emergency accommodation. The average worker in Dublin now pays half their wages in rent. Let us consider how the Minister deals with this. In April, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published social housing targets for local authorities. That included €57 million for the constituency I am privileged to represent, which the Minister, Deputy Kelly, claimed would provide 778 housing units and reduce the current waiting list by 20%. However, he was working on outdated figures. At the end of March, 4,636 households were on the Louth waiting list and 20% of this would be 927, which is 139 more than the Minister claims his strategy would provide. The fact is that his housing strategy, in Louth anyway, is based on outdated waiting list figures collected by the Housing Agency more than two years ago in May 2013. They are not contemporary figures. Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a serious flaw? Is it beyond the wit of someone in the Department to phone someone in Louth County Council for an up-to-date figure for the housing list? Of the 778 units announced for Louth, only 288, or 36%, will be provided under capital programmes and the majority will come from the private sector. Some 443 will come from the housing leasing initiative and 47 from the rental accommodation scheme. That will provide a major challenge for Louth County Council because reports indicate that there is already a major shortage of private housing for rent, with many private landlords preferring to rent or lease on the private market where more profit can be made. This reliance on the private sector is totally at odds with the Minister's position six months ago when he said:The privatisation of social housing should never have happened ... It was wrong, and it was more than wrong, it was simply unacceptable and we are going to change that.If it was wrong six months ago, why is the Labour Party Minister responsible for Government policy on housing now almost entirely reliant on private housing markets to provide social housing in Louth? Those are two issues when we consider the efficiency of this committee. I accept it has met six times in the past 12 months, but we have to measure it in terms of how it has been able to address, redress or reverse the crisis we have with private rent, mortgage distress and homelessness. I would like the Taoiseach to address some of those issues without getting into the business of the committee but just to give us some measurement as to how the Government strategically tackles these big issues.

In other words we cannot through asking when the committee last met then have a general discussion about housing policy or any other policy for that matter. I try to allow a little bit of flexibility. However, I ask Members to remember that the Taoiseach's only obligation is to give the notice of the number of meetings that were actually held - full stop. I have to say that the Taoiseach has expanded, but I would appreciate applying the rules. That is why we have a backlog of questions to the Taoiseach. I am trying to get through them in order that other issues of a very important nature can be raised.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	I know the Ceann Comhairle is drawing on all his years of experience here to define a very narrow line. It is a point of interest that Deputies want to ask questions and we can give them perhaps some facts that are distinct from a debate on Government policy on housing.Perhaps, a Cheann Comhairle, I can give Deputy Adams some of those figures. It is regrettable that anybody would lose a house. The key to preventing this is engagement with the lending institutions. Some cases end up in legal proceedings precisely because people may not have fully grasped what is necessary is terms of maintaining communication with a lending institution, be that a bank and so on. It is important people realise that the initiation of legal proceedings does not mean that homes will be repossessed.  Deputy Adams mentioned that 25% or one in four homes are being repossessed. The Central Bank statistics show that in 2014 313, principal dwelling houses were repossessed on foot of a court order. This represents less than 0.3% of the total number of family homes in mortgage arrears at the end of 2014. In 2015, the number of principal dwelling houses repossessed on a foot of a court order was 156, while a further 195 were voluntarily surrendered or abandoned. In quarter 1 of 2015, 206 buy-to-let properties were taken into possession by lenders, of which 123 were repossessed on foot of a court order and the remaining 83 properties were voluntarily surrendered or abandoned.  In terms of Government measures introduced to address this situation, the Personal Insolvency Act was enacted in 2012. This legislation introduces three new forms of non-judicial debt settlement arrangements and reduces the automatic discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to 3 years. The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, which was established to regulate the new debt settlement arrangements, reports that at the end of quarter 1 of 2015, 328 personal insolvency arrangements, the main mechanism to deal with secured debt, had been approved and that 821 arrangements, including debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements and so on, have been made to date. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, is currently working on changes to provide for the introduction of further options to deal with longer term mortgages in arrears. The introduction of a mortgage-to-rent scheme facilitates families being able to remain in their homes by way of transfer of ownership of the house to a local authority or approved housing body. At the end of May, approximately 2,800 cases had been put forward, of which 2,000 have been progressed. As part of the Government package on mortgage arrears announced last month by the Minister, this scheme is to be amended to provide for an increase in the valuation threshold and greater flexibility in regard to property size, namely, an additional bedroom, to enable more properties to qualify under that scheme. A Mortgage Arrears Information Advisory Service has also been developed. This service also provides advice via its website and helpline, to which there have been more than 238,000 visits since June 2012.  Earlier this year, the Central Bank set out new requirements for the banks to meet, including that concluded sustainable solutions be put in place for the vast majority of distressed borrowers by the end of 2015. Where legal action is taken that may result in loss of ownership for a borrower, the bank should be prepared to re-engage with the borrower and explore alternative solutions, if the borrower re-engages. By year end, 75% of concluded solutions should be meeting their terms and banks must comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and engage fully and appropriately, as set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  Deputy Adams mentioned the situation in Dublin, which is of great concern to the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputies Kelly and Coffey, respectively. This is not just an issue of concern to our citizens, it has implications for competitiveness for the country as a whole. The Deputy will be aware that the line of investment into this country is very strong. In the Dublin area and, in particular, the greater Dublin area, there have been some very significant investment announcements made in the past two years. All of these require housing and office space infrastructure, which is a fundamental part of the construction sector.  The new planning legislation currently being advanced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, is bolstered by measures introduced in budget 2015, including the national framework for housing supply. This housing provision will be based on timely and accurate data and an annual statement of projected supply and demand. The Minister has also established a housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin, which meets every Monday morning, and provides for a joined-up approach in the Dublin area, with an immediate focus on addressing supply and demand imbalances. The Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015, published two weeks ago, seeks, primarily, to address the current shortage in housing supply, with a view to facilitating an increase in the housing construction sector, particularly in Dublin. It also targets a revision of the Part V obligation for developers in relation to social and affordable housing, which will contribute an estimated 4,000 housing units to the delivery of the targets in the social housing strategy. This strategy calls for a change in the regime for development contributions so that reduced rates can be applied to existing planning permissions and for incentives and penalties aimed at encouraging the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in urban areas. The planning and development (No. 2) Bill will be published before the summer recess. This provides for the establishment of a new office of planning regulator which will provide enhanced transparency in the streamlining of the planning system, including a reduction in durations of planning permissions not progressed properly. In this regard, a use it or lose it approach will apply. This should result in an increased availability of social housing, which is a key priority for Government. As announced in the budget last year, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has been given an additional €2.2 billion in respect of social housing provision. A social housing strategy was published in November 2014. This strategy builds on the provisions contained in budget 2015 and sets out clear and measurable targets to increase the supply of social housing through reform of delivery arrangements to meet the housing needs of all households on the housing lists. The strategy also targets more than 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units, in meeting the housing needs of approximately 75,000 households through the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme. Implementation of this strategy will address in full the needs of the 90,000 households on the waiting lists, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. A provisional allocation of €1.5 billion in respect of local authority social housing provision was announced in April, the aim of which is to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,883 social housing units out to 2017. Within this, the combined programme for Dublin comes to more than €500 million, €117 million of which was allocated to the four Dublin local authorities in early May in respect of 19 build projects which will see the development of approximately 566 new units of accommodation. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has allocated this funding to the local authorities and has instructed them to get on with it in terms of social housing provision. In addition, the four Dublin local authorities have been allocated almost €6 million to bring 345 properties back into use this year and more than €15 million has been provided for Dublin across a range of other housing schemes, including works to improve housing efficiency for people with disabilities and retrofit of homes to improve energy efficiency. The home renovation incentive has been extended. This scheme is now open to landlords in respect of work carried out up to end 2015. The 80% windfall tax, which applied to chargeable gains on the disposal or development of land, which are attributable to planning decisions, has also been removed. The 33% rate of capital gains tax and other standard taxation arrangements will now apply. It is hoped this will remove any disincentive to the selling of land that might otherwise be put to good use.  First-time buyers are also being supported through the introduction of a refund of deposit interest retention tax on savings used to purchase a home. The Living City initiative, which is a new urban regeneration incentive focused on the regeneration of the historic centres of six cities, including Waterford, Limerick, Kilkenny, Galway, Dublin and Cork, has also been introduced. We do not want to see anybody sitting on land for the purpose of driving prices higher and cashing in. The Minister for Finance has held a public consultation on if and how this issue is to be addressed. He has also indicated that he will examine what taxation measures might be put in place to penalise landowners who do not develop land that is already zoned and serviced, if that is required.These are some of the provisions the Government has put in place to address this. However, as we all know, we cannot deal with the issue unless we put blocks, concrete and houses in place. That is the reason the full focus of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and of the Minister of State, with responsibility for housing, is on dealing with this urgent priority. While some 20,000 extra people have been employed in the past 12 months in the construction sector, there is clearly a need now for the Minister of State to prioritise the issues in respect of the Planning Bill and incentives for builders to get to work and meet the demand for private and social housing. We have allocated the money to the local authorities. They have the directions, the targets and the land. Let them get on with it now. We must also look at the other question regarding how to meet demand, both in the greater Dublin area and beyond and the Minister of State is addressing that vigorously.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	The reason we are asking the Taoiseach about the frequency of the meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee on housing and mortgage arrears is because this is the most serious crisis facing our citizens and the entire economy. However, there seems to be no sense of urgency from the top of Government as to how bad the situation is. It is no exaggeration to say we are at the edge of and heading right into the eye of a storm that will rip apart the lives of tens of thousands of families and children and now represents a serious threat to the economy as a whole. Today, the Central Bank produced a report which states the rise in property and rental prices across the whole commercial and property sectors is a major domestic threat to the economy, probably the major domestic threat. At a human level, the situation is beyond appalling. I am not exaggerating when I say that every day and week a trail of families relate heart-breaking family stories in my clinic, and I know the situation is the same for other Deputies. The stories go on and on and it is evident from them that the crisis is reaching further and deeper into society. Every spectrum of society is affected. Students have to share accommodation with strangers because they cannot get accommodation. Families and children are being evicted because landlords are seeking higher rents and now dozens and hundreds of them face homelessness. We are moving towards a situation where thousands of people face the same fate. The situation is disastrous and getting worse. The Government is not even scratching the surface in terms of its response. I do not have time to go into the figures, but as I have pointed out on a number of occasions to the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach, the targets are a mirage and will not materialise, because the Government hopes to get 80% of the social housing it proposes to deliver this year from the private sector. That is not going to happen. Figures released this week show there are 10,000 extra families a month seeking private rented accommodation. These are people who are working, but even on average wages, they have extreme difficulty sourcing affordable accommodation. They cannot buy and are completely crowding out anybody on a low income or who is social welfare dependant.  Therefore, the idea that local authorities will source the necessary social accommodation from private landlords or developers is fantasy. Any serious look at the figures makes this clear. The target for 2015 is 15,800 units. Some 8,400 of these are due to come through HAPs to private landlords, some 3,000 are to come through leasing from private landlords and some 2,000 are to come through RAS, again through private landlords. Therefore, we are not delivering social housing. We are not delivering council housing. We are hoping against hope that we will get the housing from private landlords, when all of the evidence shows that private landlords are moving away from people on low incomes who are dependent on rent allowance and social welfare. The private landlords are looking for high prices, which are unaffordable, even for people on medium earnings. A three bedroom apartment in south Dublin now rents for from €1,500 to €1,800. The average net after tax income for a worker is approximately €2,400 per month. Therefore, people are expected to pay two thirds of their income to put a roof over their head, leaving them with very little to pay the rest of their bills. This is the case for people on the average income, €35,000 a year. Imagine what it is like for somebody who is social welfare dependent, dependent on rent allowance or for someone on a low income or working in Dunnes Stores. Paying such a rent is not possible. The purpose of our questions is to appeal to the Government to get into emergency mode on this issue. As the Taoiseach rightly said, bricks and mortar must follow. At this point, this must be done by the State. Otherwise, we will not even get close to the targets. If the Government depends on the private sector, it will not happen.  Rent control must be introduced as a matter of urgency. Based on the figures of 10,000 extra people moving into the private rented sector and the chronic shortage of accommodation, one does not need to be Einstein to work out that rents will continue to rocket. They have already risen by 20%. We will face a catastrophe in six months' time. Rent controls, not rent certainty, must be introduced now so that rents will be related to the ability of people to pay them. If the Government does not introduce rent control, it is consigning people directly into homelessness. I appeal to the Taoiseach to get into emergency mode. We did it for the liquidation of IBRC. I plead with him to do it for the most urgent social crisis facing the State.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	I think the Deputy is unduly pessimistic about the capacity of the industry to respond, although it is admittedly slow to take off. In Dublin and everywhere else, we will not deal with the situation until houses are built. In so far as the State is concerned, the Government has made an allocation of €2.2 billion to deal with all of the cases on the housing list - over 90,000 - over the next number of years. We are not just saying we propose to allocate this money. This money has already been provided and local authorities have been given their targets and directions, so let them get on with it. The private sector must get involved here also. In the past six months, for example, some hundreds of millions of euro in terms of investment have come into the greater Dublin region. This creates a demand for housing, apartments, commercial industrial space and general infrastructure and calls for massive involvement of the construction sector, bringing jobs for builders. In respect of housing, there is clearly a problem in regard to where the changes in the rules of the Central Bank, which now require 40% of funding to be put up by builders. This was not the case previously, when 100% borrowing was allowed and the situation was allowed to get out of control, with builders building on the profits from sales. Then the entire process collapsed. The assumption at the time was that the State could run on the proceeds of the construction sector. The situation is different now, because all sectors across the board are making solid progress, for example, financial services, hospitality, the agri-sector and other elements making up our economy. What we need is capacity of competent contractors to build good and affordable houses.  I never want to see a situation again where contractors are let get out of control, where having got planning permission, they will proceed to build whatever they want on their land. We cannot have the Priory Halls or similar again. Deputy Boyd Barrett knows as well as I do that one of the key components of controlling the situation is to have a very good clerk of works examining these sites, someone who will point out what is not in accordance with building requirements and call for it to be knocked down.They will soon learn not to build to an inferior quality. We have had some outstanding builders in the country who have built very good buildings and very fine houses. The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, are working at the moment on a number of elements which I genuinely hope will give a real stimulus and impetus to the construction sector, particularly housing. Deputy Boyd Barrett is probably aware that some people are advised to go on the homeless list when they leave their accommodation. The Department of Social Protection, the Tánaiste and Threshold have been very clear that if the information is available that the landlord will increase the rent, and that the tenant is likely to be put out on the street or removed from the accommodation, a scheme is operated by Threshold which provides rent assistance in individual cases. Many hundreds of people have received assistance and been able to stay in their accommodation. That scheme continues in operation. In many cases, people are either not informed about it or they are advised to go on the homeless list. Some local authorities have a much more vigorous response to providing houses than others, and where land is zoned, they get on with the business. Local authorities have received their targets and moneys from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and building is already under way for units of two, five, ten, 20 or 100. Those who are likely to be caught by an increase in rent should certainly avail of the scheme because it has helped approximately 1,000 people to date. When the Minister comes back with a package, I hope some certainty in respect of rent will be included so that people can project forward with a degree of certainty. Such a package of measures will help to drive the agenda. I hope the Department of Finance and the other elements of the financial institutions will be able to play their part as well. There is a requirement on contractors in terms of them being able to access the finance they need as a component of the overall approach to get building under way. The requirement is now 40% and some find it difficult to raise that amount. An examination is required of how that can best be accommodated. I hope we can debate the package of measures when the Ministers bring it to the Dáil.

I participated in the debate on the housing Bill last year but since then there has not been a debate on the biggest disaster and crisis facing the majority of people in this country. The Taoiseach mentioned a couple of issues and said that we are unduly pessimistic. He acknowledged that measures were a bit slow to take off. Since I came to the House I have heard about Construction 2020. The Taoiseach thinks that if he keeps saying it often enough, he will convince us that houses are being built, but as in the children’s story, a child will point out that the emperor has no clothes. We can see that no houses are being built. One could ask what the 20,000 people employed in the construction sector are doing. The Taoiseach has listed a number of measures introduced by the Government, namely, the windfall tax and the reduction in capital gains tax, and he also mentioned the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP. They are all incentives thrown in the direction of private landlords and developers to try to get them to provide housing, but they are not interested in providing housing for the people who desperately need it. They are only interested in providing housing for profit. The only people in a position to buy houses right now are people who already have a lot of money. One could ask what NAMA is doing while all this is going on. I received figures from NAMA on Dublin 15. Is the Taoiseach and his Minister aware that not one social house is planned in the greater Blanchardstown area?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	Yet.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	There is not one house in Dublin 15. The reason for that is because the council does not have any land, and also because NAMA has many houses in Dublin 15. It has 170 units in Hollywood Rath on 20.98 acres. As to the type of unit in question, they are mansions. No one in Dublin 15 who is on the housing list can afford them. We have a housing crisis but let NAMA, which is paid for by the taxpayer, build and sanction mansions. That is what is going on. I refer to the crisis in the rental sector. A report published yesterday showed a 52% increase in the number of people renting in the past 18 months. A total of 700,000 people are renting today compared with only 455,000 in December 2013. The Taoiseach is presiding over a situation where no building is taking place and people are being forced into the private rented sector. A total of 10,000 a month are being forced to rent. That just shows the housing strategy is not working. Rents in Kildare, for example, have increased by 15.5% and they have increased by more than 10% in Dublin. I hope we are not boring the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly. The Labour Party argued in favour of keeping rent supplement low because otherwise it would result in an increase in rent, but rent is increasing anyway. The main effect of the Government’s policy is that almost everyone on rent supplement is being forced into paying illegal top-ups on their rent to landlords. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, should be very concerned about that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	Could the Deputy please return to asking questions because we have only 12 minutes left and I am trying to get to the next three questions?
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	113	Yes. What people who are waiting on housing are forced to do when their rent supplement is not increased is to pay illegal top-ups on their rent to landlords. It is the only type of social welfare fraud that I do not hear the Government giving out about, because the people who benefit from the fraud are wealthy landlords and those who suffer from it are the poorest people in the State who are forced to go to moneylenders, for example. The second most common reason for homelessness is the repossession of buy-to-let accommodation. A total of 35,000 households are potentially at risk of homelessness as a receiver can evict tenants to sell the house. Could the Taoiseach indicate whether there is a plan to introduce legislation to deal with the issue? The Government has repeatedly refused to change the law in this area, whereby someone living in a property due to be sold following repossession has no right of recourse to stay in the property and continue to pay rent. That alone would save a considerable number of people from being turfed onto the streets. The biggest problem people face in the housing sector is the collapse in construction by local authorities under the Government's term in office. Despite all of the fanfare about Social Housing Strategy 2020, the Government has further privatised local authority housing and sources more and more of it through RAS and HAP. Does the Taoiseach know how many people have taken up the HAP scheme in Dublin City Council? The answer is only a handful because landlords are not interested. Does the Taoiseach not see the error of a policy introduced last year which is clearly not going to work? It was intended that 75% of units would be sourced in that way, but it will not work. When will the committee discuss the matter and report back on it? The biggest increase in homelessness is family homelessness, which has increased by 800% since 2013. Focus Ireland, which works on the front line with families, has said the increase in homelessness has taken place in the middle of an economic recovery. It used to deal with eight families a month but that had increased to 71 in April. In excess of 100,000 are on the waiting lists for housing. We need those issues to be discussed, and not just by the committee. Will the matter be brought to the Dáil for a debate at some stage because people find it incredible that there has not been a debate on the biggest social ill facing society, bar none? It is more important than the water charges or anything else.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	In December 2014, the Minister with responsibility for housing and planning announced the implementation plan of the State's response to homelessness. The plan sets out a range of short-term and medium-term approaches. It will deliver 2,700 units for homeless people by the end of 2016. I will remind the Deputy of some of the actions that were taken. An increase of 271 beds in the Dublin region has brought the total number of beds available for adults across the Dublin region to 1,762 as of 15 May. Merchants Quay Ireland is providing a State-funded night café, providing a key contact point for people who do not or cannot access emergency accommodation. It operates seven nights per week from 11 p.m. until 7.30 a.m. I found the service there, and the people who work in it and use it, to be first class. The Housing First service, which has responsibility for engaging with and responding to the accommodation and support needs of people sleeping rough in Dublin, has extended its on-street service until 3 a.m. During 2014, 2,333 vacant units across the country were brought back into productive use and the 2015 target is 1,000. The Tenancy Protection Service on behalf of the local authorities in Dublin and Cork has protected 390 tenancies since the inception of the service in June 2014 and arrangements are under way to establish a single assessment centre for families who are currently accommodated in hotels. There is ongoing liaising with South Dublin County Council regarding NAMA properties. NAMA has approved €1.6 billion across a range of construction projects and €1 billion has been drawn down to fund commercial and residential construction projects, including the completion of existing projects and the development of new projects. NAMA established a dedicated residential delivery team comprising staff with specialist finance, development and planning expertise to support the agency's residential development strategy. NAMA completed detailed analysis of its residential sites within the greater Dublin area and across the other urban centres in which NAMA security is predominantly located. NAMA’s residential delivery team is project managing viable projects through appraisal, design and planning stages with a view to bringing them to “shovel-ready” state. NAMA has committed to funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in the Dublin area by the end of 2016, 1,362 of which were delivered in 2014 as against a target of 1,000, representing more than 40% of Dublin’s total new housing supply in 2014. NAMA’s objective is to deliver another 1,500 units in 2015 with the remainder to be delivered during 2016.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	NAMA is already working to facilitate delivery of substantial housing beyond 2016 and in this regard funding its debtors and receivers to progress two projects through design, pre-planning and planning processes consistent with the priorities set out in the local development plan. Deputy Coppinger will be aware of the complete collapse of the construction sector. We were building 90,000 houses per year but it dropped to 8,500. The Deputy can understand the loss of 100,000 construction workers and what it meant. While the base is very low, strong growth in housing activity is evident, particularly in Dublin. At a national level, activity is moving closer to projected requirements, with just over 11,000 units completed last year. Some 2,629 were completed in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 26% on the same period last year. This masks serious deficits in Dublin, where just 3,268 units were completed in the four Dublin local authorities in 2014. This comprises 1,487 houses and 1,781 apartments. NAMA facilitated the delivery of 1,362 units in 2014, representing more than 40% of the total new housing output in Dublin. The Deputy can understand that the Housing Agency projected a requirement last year in Dublin of 5,400 units, to rise in subsequent years, with other estimates in the order of 6,000 to 8,000 units per annum.

Work by the Department of Finance suggests the number of houses completed in Dublin in 2015 will be approximately 3,800 units, up 20% on 2014 but still a 40% shortfall on the estimated demand. We need competent contractors on the ground with the ability to build quality houses at affordable prices as quickly as possible.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on justice reform has met on eight occasions to date and last met on 25 May 2015. I expect that it will meet again soon but the date for its next meeting has not been scheduled yet.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. The Taoiseach will agree that the Cabinet committee on justice reform was established because the Government had allowed the sector to slide into crisis after crisis and was a sign that the Government was looking for a way out. In particular the background to the justice reform committee was the way the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, behaved in embroiling the Garda Síochána in an unprecedented crisis and the effective removal of a Garda Commissioner. Like the Moriarty tribunal, the Taoiseach is keen to bury any inconvenient investigation, and does so with sustained energy. However, many people believe the Taoiseach and his staff are already busy spinning regarding the Fennelly commission. We read about sections of the report in the Irish Independent last Saturday, while the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, is meant to be on holidays and has not received his part of the report yet. Is the Taoiseach concerned over these selective leaks? They seem to be leaked in such a way as to be spun positively in the Taoiseach’s direction.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	No matter what the report says, the Taoiseach will declare himself to have been cleared, rush it through a debate in the Dáil and then try to smother it in other leaks and announcements. Does the Taoiseach intend to bring it before the Cabinet committee on justice reform, will he agree in advance with the House a timetable for releasing and debating the report after it has been submitted, or will he insist on controlling and spinning all of it through his favourite channels?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	It might be useful if the Taoiseach could indicate when he expects the Fennelly report might be published. The committee has met two times more than the other one with which we dealt and has also dealt with many scandalous issues that eroded public confidence in the administration of justice. I welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is making its slow way through the two Houses. When does the Taoiseach expect the Garda authority to be operational? We have argued very strongly for an independent policing authority, and in particular we have concerns that there should be an independent criminal justice inspectorate as opposed to a Minister dealing with such issues. Given that we are out of time, perhaps the Taoiseach would give us some information on the two issues, particularly the first one. When does he expect the Fennelly report to be published?

I have already said, on many occasions, that when I receive a copy of the Fennelly report that can be published, it will be published in accordance with the law.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	It is not agreed. Our Whip wrote to the Chief Whip last week to protest at the proposed schedule for this week not least because of the late sittings promised for Tuesday and Thursday but also in the light of the manner in which legislation was being crammed into the Thursday sitting and the fact that Topical Issues were being relegated on a regular basis to the end of the day's business, replicating the old Adjournment debate system which we unanimously agreed to change. We are opposing the proposal for the late sitting this evening. It is proposed to commence the debate on the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 at 9 p.m. and adjourn at 10.30 p.m. We will be sitting late again tomorrow evening and adjourning at 10 p.m. on Thursday. This follows a period in which the Dáil only met for 18 days out of 70. This speaks to the Government's mismanagement of the legislative programme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	The least the House should expect is an orderly flow of legislation throughout the year. We now have a ridiculous scenario. We met for one and a half days after the May bank holiday weekend and nothing seemed to happen during the month of May in terms of debating legislation. We took a full week off after the June bank holiday. Now everything is being crammed in during the last few weeks of the term. That means that legislation will not be properly considered. Members will be debating important legislation late at night. This flies in the face of what the programme for Government stated would happen in dealing with legislation. That is the basis on which we oppose the proposal that the Dáil sit later than 9 p.m. It is not good enough to discuss an important Bill at that late hour because it does not treat the House with the respect it deserves.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	Sinn Féin is also opposing the proposal for the late sitting because it is unnecessary. We had a recess which was completely unnecessary at the start of the month. It appears to us that the Government is attempting to cram legislation in before the summer recess. This does not represent orderly management of the legislative programme. It is also unfair and has implications for Deputies with young children. In particular, it deters women who might otherwise seek election to the Dáil. At the risk of getting myself into some bother, during the last late sitting I met one Deputy - I will not name him - who was quite drunk. Backbenchers are sitting about with nothing to do but go to the bar. Our business has been reduced to this. We oppose the proposal because it flies in the face of the talk about Dáil reform.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	I wish to put to the Taoiseach a proposal for Government time. Last evening there was a very serious programme on RTE in respect of collusion between British state security forces and loyalist paramilitary groups over a sustained period which resulted in the murder of innocent people. It was an excellent investigative programme and, as such, merits the most serious consideration by the Oireachtas and the Government. I call on the Taoiseach to set time aside to facilitate a comprehensive debate on the matters covered by that programme and other matters, if necessary. We have been calling for various debates in respect of related matters on Northern Ireland but for some reason they have not been ordered or managed by Government. I sincerely put it to the Taoiseach that in light of last evening's programme, there is an importance to debating in this House the issues that emanate from that programme. They go to the heart of the relationship between our Government, our State, the British state and the British Government. I am unsure whether the Taoiseach has been in touch with the Prime Minister in respect of the content of that programme or whether he has spoken to the British ambassador on the matter, but it is very serious and merits the Oireachtas taking it seriously. I am asking that the Government would agree to set time aside to facilitate the debate on the issues that arose in that programme. I understand it has emerged that the businessman, Denis O'Brien, has begun a legal action against the State arising from speeches and remarks made in the Dáil about his banking affairs with the State-owned Irish Banking Resolution Corporation. Essentially it is challenging stances and statements made by various Deputies. I am keen to ensure the Government and the Oireachtas take such a challenge to the fundamentals of our democracy, including the parliamentary right to speech, very seriously indeed and that the strongest of legal representation will be secured by the Oireachtas and the State to resist this particular challenge. In many ways it is extraordinary that we are at this particular point. In essence, something that has been cherished since the foundation of the State, that is, the right to parliamentary privilege and of Deputies to articulate views they believe to be in the public interest, is being challenged in such a comprehensive and substantive way. This matter goes to the heart of our parliamentary democracy and I am asking for the Taoiseach's comments on the matter. In the programme for Government specific promises were made on caring for older people, specifically: "Investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority of this Government." HIQA has made recommendations in reports about a number of local district hospitals. Approximately 26 of those hospitals have not yet provided an accepted funded plan to construct or refurbish units, although it was determined by HIQA that they should. Approximately 1,372 beds in these district hospitals throughout the country are now in danger - many of them are in the southern part of the country - as a result of Government inaction and failure to provide the necessary funding in line with its programme for Government and legislative commitments in terms of the supply of more and better care for older people. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government is going to fulfil its commitment in the programme for Government in respect of these district hospitals and the need to ensure these 1,372 beds are kept open?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	Before the Taoiseach replies, I remind the Deputy that any actions taken against the Houses of the Oireachtas is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and will be considered in due course by the Oireachtas Commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	Thank you for that clarification, a Cheann Comhairle. The right and privilege of Members to have their say on matters of public interest was confirmed in the High Court in the recent case adjudicated and clarified by the judge. That is in accordance with everyone's understanding of the situation given the fact that there is constitutional protection to the right of privilege of elected Members. That privilege is so important in the interests of public concern and democracy. It is a privilege that has to be exerted with responsibility. I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling to the effect that any action taken against this State or the Oireachtas will be responded to by the Oireachtas commission. I think it is appropriate that we should have a comprehensive debate on Northern Ireland. We have had questions on sexual abuse, collusion, the issue of Ballymurphy and a number of other areas, not to mention the difficulties in general that apply here. For the information of Members, I have given a commitment that the State would supply information that is relevant and legal in respect of the coroner's inquest arising from the Kingsmill massacre. This had to be done in two stages: a decision by Cabinet in principle and then the issuing of a direction to the Garda Commissioner. The decision in principle was taken two weeks ago. Since then, the Garda Commissioner has followed the instructions and direction of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Information was transferred by gardaí to the coroner last week in Belfast. This is in accordance with a commitment that was given. I hope it is also a demonstration for others that where paperwork and documentation relevant to other incidents in Northern Ireland can be provided by the British Government, that should also apply. Since we are in the business of reconciliation, a Cheann Comhairle, I believe this is an important issue. I will bring Deputy Martin up to date in respect of the residential beds to which he referred. I know that HIQA has commenced unannounced inspections in many cases and is highlighting the inadequacy and the general conduct of personnel in a number of institutions where elderly people are residents.The Deputy will be aware of a number of pending court cases arising from an inspection last year and an exposure of what was happening in those institutions.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	I too wish to raise the issue of last night's programme on collusion. I do so in two contexts: first, the need for a debate in this House and, second, the question of the Good Friday Agreement and the commitments in the programme for Government to the full implementation of that Agreement. I welcome the Taoiseach's indication that a debate will take place. However, he has said consistently that there would be a debate on a motion regarding the Ballymurphy massacre. I welcome the fact we received a draft motion, which I signed off on in consultation with the families. However, we are still waiting for a date for that debate. It is difficult to get issues relating to the North discussed here with the frequency they require. Will the Taoiseach request or instruct the Government Chief Whip to arrange these debates before the summer recess? Last night's programme tells us, particularly people like me from the North, what we have already known for a very long time, namely, the depth at which the British Government directed, from the highest political level, the killing of citizens. It is also clear from some of the former Government spokespersons that successive Governments here were aware of or at least suspected collusion. In my view, successive Irish Governments have failed hundreds of families of citizens in the North but also in this State. The most obvious example is the Dublin-Monaghan bombings but there are other cases, including the Dundalk bombings in 1975, in which Hugh Watters and Jack Rooney were killed, and the case of Seamus Ludlow. The Government has a responsibility in these matters. It is not just a matter of our having a debate. The Government is co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. Where does the citizen look to if not to the Government? The Finucane inquiry has not been established and the British Government is saying it will not establish it. I have come in here many times and asked the Government to put together a strategy, using our international friends and our diplomatic capacity, to get the British Government to do what it is obliged to do under the Good Friday and other agreements. It might not be the appropriate time to raise this, but Relatives for Justice represents hundreds of families who are victims of state terrorism. The Taoiseach should meet them to inform himself on all these matters. I understand he is meeting David Cameron later this week. Is it his intention to raise these issues at that meeting? This is a neighbouring state whose Government authorised its forces to kill citizens of this nation and of this State.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	As Deputy Adams knows well, there were more than 3,000 deaths during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, some on the Northern side of the Border and some on this side of the Border. As I said in response to the earlier question, I gave a commitment that I would supply the information that is available in Garda files on the Kingsmill murders. That information is being sent to the coroner in Northern Ireland. I hope that is an expression and demonstration of my commitment to dealing with the legacies of the past and that the British Government will now supply any information it can supply in numerous other cases. I hope there will also be other opportunities here to do the same. I will raise these matters at my meeting with the British Prime Minister. Clearly, there is the issue of welfare reform and the situation so far as the Executive is concerned, the programme on collusion and all the other issues that are relevant to the situation in which we now find ourselves. We will have the debate before the House rises for the summer, and the Whip will make that arrangement. As to whether we divide the time on the day between a debate on Ballymurphy, if we can get agreement on a motion, followed by a wider debate on Northern Ireland issues, or whether all these matters are taken together as part of one debate, we can have that discussion before we decide on the time allocation. The debate will take place before the summer recess.

I am also honoured to welcome the parents and family members of Every Life Counts, who are present in the Visitors Gallery and who joined me today for an excellent briefing on the issue. Their testimonies are more powerful than any words I could ever utter in this Chamber or elsewhere. They are courageous and compassionate people who are advocating for an end to the use of the phrase "incompatible with life" to describe severely disabled unborn children. Like many phrases that may have once been prevalent in our society, such as "illegitimate" or "retard", the phrase "incompatible with life" must be eliminated from our public discourse when describing unborn children with severe life limiting medical conditions or disabilities. My Bill is a humble effort to begin that process. It is a process I hope the Government will support. It is also one which I am confident the medical profession will support in light of its noble calling truthfully and compassionately to diagnose the sick and heal the vulnerable. I and the parents who are present have the highest regard for the medical personnel working in our health care system. As we see from daily news reports, they work under outrageous working conditions, all types of pressure and with a lack of resources. Above all, we wish this process to be a partnership between all concerned parties and to have a conversation about this terminology, especially in view of how the use of the terminology I mentioned earlier has been erased, and to examine this issue sensitively. We have no interest in criminalising health care professionals. I cannot stress this point sufficiently. We are not seeking to impose penalties or to use coercive means. We are seeking a reasoned and compassionate discussion and the removal of this terminology. We are also seeking the provision of perinatal hospice care, which is badly needed in this country. No medical professional wishes to misdiagnose or consciously mislead prospective parents about the extent of their unborn child's disability. Despite this good faith, however, the continued use of the phrase "incompatible with life" makes such possibilities increasingly likely. The term is medically meaningless and serves no practical purpose. There is no medical diagnosis for the use of the term. In the words of one of the mothers, Mrs. Tracey Harkin, a spokesperson for Every Life Counts: "This is about ensuring that doctors live up to their professional obligations not to misinform parents, and ensuring that parents and babies get the best medical care possible at a time when they receive news of a diagnosis that can have devastating implications." None of us can know how devastating those implications are until we have listened to what the parents in the Visitors Gallery say, and which they are willing to communicate to the media and everybody else. She continued: "We are calling on all TDs and Senators to support the discontinuation of a label which can lead to lethal discrimination and a lack of best care for devastated families". That is not a big ask. In the professional discourse of modern medicine, no one would dare suggest that the use of the terms I mentioned earlier could be countenanced. This Bill is simply an effort to include the phrase "incompatible with life" in the misleading terminology that is ill-suited to the practice of evidence-based medicine. I hope the Bill will emerge from the lottery, that the Government will not oppose it and that we can have a reasonable debate in both Houses, so people with far more experience than me in the medical and legal fields can discuss it. Hopefully, we can have this terminology, "incompatible with life", banished from everyday use.

Everybody acknowledges that the DEIS programme to combat disadvantage in schools at primary and post-primary level has been a significant success since its introduction. Under the DEIS programme additional resources have been made available to the relevant primary and post-primary schools to deal with disadvantage. All Members also accept the importance of identifying areas of significant disadvantage in both urban and rural areas, which is done under the DEIS programme, measuring the level of disadvantage in as scientific a manner as possible and providing the type of resources that are necessary to combat that disadvantage. We accept that society benefits enormously from retaining children who come from a disadvantaged background in education and ensuring that they can maximise their potential while within the education system. The issue is that the DEIS programme has effectively been closed down since approximately 2011. The Minister did not do it; her predecessor was somewhat involved in the process. The outcome of the closure of the DEIS programme to new entrants means that newly developed schools, schools that have merged and newly built schools have not been in a position to avail of the resources available to other schools previously existing in the DEIS programme. It is difficult to quantify the number of schools at issue. I estimate approximately 30 new primary schools were built between 2011 and 2013, but I am not sure how many post-primary schools have been developed from 2011 to now.I have a certain interest in this because I chaired the board of a post-primary community school created through the amalgamation of three post-primary schools, two of which had disadvantaged or DEIS status. It is virtually incomprehensible that, although the feeder schools to this school have DEIS status and two of the schools that formed part of the new entity had DEIS status, the new entity itself does not. There is something fundamentally unfair, unreasonable and wrong about this. I understand that the Minister is undertaking a review and that she has set up an interdepartmental working group to ensure a joined-up approach to the delivery of services. She has set up a technical group to develop a revised identification process for schools that might be brought into whatever new system is created. The students from disadvantaged backgrounds need the intervention now. That they have been without that intervention since 2011 is offensive. That the Department is setting up some sort of framework to examine how they might be included in the future will inevitably give rise to undesirable circumstances. The students who are going through primary school and will subsequently go through post-primary school will have only one chance of availing of supports but if those supports are not in place now, they will not be able to avail of them.

On a point of clarification, it was long before 2011 that schools were no longer allowed enter the DEIS scheme. In fact, very few were admitted after 2005. There was a very small number admitted up to 2009. After that, the scheme has not reopened for new schools.

As the Deputy may be aware, last month saw the publication of a report, Learning from the Evaluation of DEIS, which was commissioned by my Department from the ESRI. This report assesses the main findings of research and evaluations carried out to date on the DEIS programme. This research was conducted by the Educational Research Centre and the inspectorate of my Department. It reviews other Irish and international related research on educational disadvantage and provides advice to inform future policy direction on educational disadvantage. The report highlights some of the encouraging findings concerning the performance of schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage. A change in approach within DEIS schools is evident, with a significant improvement in planning for teaching and learning and in setting targets for achievement. There has been a significant improvement over time in literacy test scores among students in designated disadvantaged primary schools. Levels of non-attendance between urban primary schools and non-DEIS urban schools have narrowed. Following the publication of the ESRI report, I announced a process for the renewal of the DEIS programme. I have already commenced consultation with the education partners to inform the development of appropriate measures to continue to support those at risk of poor educational outcomes. Submissions are expected to be returned to my Department within the next week. Socioeconomic differences in educational outcomes cannot be viewed in isolation from the broader social context. The interconnectedness of different domains of children's lives points to the importance of joined-up thinking between educational policy and broader social policy. Therefore, I am also establishing an interdepartmental working group to ensure a joined-up approach to the delivery of services in future policy on educational disadvantage. A technical working group will consider what eligibility criteria are now appropriate to re-identify the level of need in schools. This work will take place over the course of the 2015-16 school year. The outcome of this process will form part of an overall proposal for the delivery of future interventions to tackle educational disadvantage. Any revised identification process for schools will be clearly set out and communicated to schools. All schools that meet the set criteria will be included.

Nobody could disagree with her proposals but, meanwhile back at the ranch, children are going through primary and post-primary schools that warrant DEIS classification but which do not have the resources required. She is effectively saying to the students she will not be able to do anything for them and that they will have to continue within their primary or post-primary schools under such circumstances, despite there being a cohort of students in DEIS-categorised schools that she will look after. She is implying she will look after children in the non-DEIS schools at some time in the future when the commissioned reports are brought forward. I examined data on one of the schools only today. An analysis of the second-year students in that school showed that 77% were at or below the 50th percentile in verbal reasoning. Some 76% of the students in third year were at or below the 50th percentile. We all know the importance being attributed to mathematics. With regard to numerical ability in the school in question, 87% of the students in the second year were at or below the 50th percentile, while 82% of the students in third year were below the 50th percentile. We have got to do something for children in such circumstances. When one couples the failure to expand and develop the DEIS programme to keep pace with the expansion of schools with the fact that the Department took away the guidance support service that so many schools had, one realises a dreadful disservice is being done to disadvantaged students, in particular.

After 2009, no schools got in. The kinds of schools the Deputy is talking about, which were amalgamated and so on, could not get in either from 2009.

New schools that were founded since 2009 did not get in either. Therefore, there is a problem. I am addressing it but it will take time to identify exactly which schools should be included and which should not. We need to ensure we provide the funding that is necessary. Inevitably, there will be more schools coming in. I do not want to cut the budgets of schools that are already in the DEIS scheme; nobody in this House would want to do so. Therefore, I will have to identify the funding that will be required for the schools that will be eligible under the new procedures. However, we have started work on this already and will work as quickly as we can. Doing the work within one year is difficult enough. It is a tight deadline. There are very detailed technical specifications that have to be worked out. We will do the work in the timeframe and announce our decision as soon as we can. I have a very strong commitment to educational disadvantage and always have had. I want to ensure that we include as many schools as possible in the DEIS scheme so we can have more equality of opportunity for all children in schools.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and the Minister for Education and Skills for attending. Last Friday I attended a presentation of certificates in the Limerick Education Centre, with which the Minister will be very familiar. The certificates were for teachers who have recently obtained a qualification to deliver the Reading Recovery programme. As the Minister will know, this is an early intervention programme offered to children in senior infants and first class to improve their literacy. The participants have an obvious need of help of a concerted one-to-one nature. The programme has been in operation for a number of years. In excess of 20,000 children have benefited from it since its initiation and there is widespread support for it. In the recent past, the Department of Education and Skills has sanctioned the provision of Reading Recovery to non-DEIS schools. This follows on from the previous debate.The main issue concerns the training of Reading Recovery teachers and those teachers who are on secondment being returned to their posts after five years. This leaves a gap in respect of the ability of education centres like the Limerick Education Centre to train Reading Recovery teachers. It is estimated that there are seven leaders. An extra two leaders would be able to train an additional 28 teachers for schools across the country. This would benefit in or around 200 children. Anywhere between 280 and 300 children would potentially benefit from this. I know that a huge number of schools has already signalled that they would like to be able to get into this. I think in excess of 155 non-DEIS schools have applied. While the Department has allowed non-DEIS schools to enter the Reading Recovery programme, the fact that we are short of Reading Recovery leaders because they are returning to the classroom to carry out functions in their base schools means we do not have the capability to train them. I do not believe anybody really disputes the merits of Reading Recovery. If one saw the five children who were present last Friday afternoon when I visited Marshal House in Limerick, listened to their parents talk about the change in confidence and behaviour the programme has brought about and listened to their teachers talk about the transition those children can make from first class up through the ranks without having recourse to learning support and resource, which is the usual safety net that is left when children move from first class and do not have the basic literacy levels attained, one could see that this crutch is removed. This is an 18 week programme. It is a short stint and is a very focused, intensive and parent-supported scheme that works. Unfortunately, if a child is in a small rural school or an urban non-DEIS school, they may not have access to it. A child can be educationally disadvantaged in any location in the country. Their postal address does not dictate whether they will or will not be disadvantaged. Going back to the previous discussion, the model of assigning resources, be they for Reading Recovery, learning support or resource, based on a postal address is a bit outdated. A child can be every bit as socially and educationally disadvantaged in a very affluent area as they can be in a so-called socially deprived area. Could we get those Reading Recovery leaders in place to put the necessary teachers out into the schools through our education centres to deliver this programme?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	I have met with some Reading Recovery teachers and certainly their dedication and commitment to the programme is evident when one speaks to them. I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by the Deputy to clarify the position on literacy supports for primary schools. My Department's policy in this area is outlined in Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life - The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy for Children and Young People2011-2020. The strategy required that a greater emphasis be placed on literacy and numeracy within a balanced curriculum across all schools. This strategy has also been prioritised for investment. This year, an additional €6 million has been provided for the implementation of the strategy, bringing the annual budget to €13.8 million. I am pleased to inform the House that standards in the areas of literacy and numeracy have shown substantial improvement over the period of the strategy. A recent study by the independent Educational Research Centre, ERC, found that overall performance in reading and mathematics by students in second and sixth classes was significantly higher than in the 2009 assessments. These are the first significant improvements recorded by the national assessments in over 30 years. Targets for improvement in the national literacy and numeracy strategy 2011-20 were thought to be ambitious in 2011 when they were set. These results show that the targets have already been met for the overall student population well in advance of the 2020 target. The strategy places a special emphasis on the needs of schools serving areas of disadvantage. Reading Recovery is a literacy programme offered to DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools only as part of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, which was launched in May 2005. Reading Recovery is an early intervention designed to provide children who have particular difficulties in reading and writing after their first year in primary school with a period of intensive individualised teaching support. Schools in these areas were invited to have teachers trained in the programme. In some areas where training took place in local cluster groups, additional schools were facilitated in participating in the programme. My Department has prioritised support for the programme and has spent over €4 million on it over the past five years. Current plans provide that support will continue for over 500 schools involved in the programme. Since 2010, over 20,000 students have benefited from the provision of the programme. The recent ERC evaluation of the DEIS programme made positive findings concerning the impact of the programme on student learning. While the intensive phase of training is completed, my Department support services continue to offer training where required, for example, new teachers. In conclusion, support for literacy will continue to be a priority for my Department. The evidence shows that the current approach is yielding good results for student learning. Significant investment is being made across all schools. However, my Department is anxious that we continue to target schools with the greatest need with most supports, particularly in a climate of constrained budgets.

It is better than a situation I experienced recently. A man in his fifties arrived at my constituency office. I gave him a form for a housing adaptation grant and he told me he could not fill it out because he was illiterate. The only other person who knew that was his wife. He had reared a family and put them through university. Early intervention does work and I acknowledge the Minister's reply in respect of that. The Minister mentioned DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools. She knows the make up of my constituency as she is in a neighbouring constituency. She knows that there are very few DEIS schools there. However, a child can be as educationally and socially disadvantaged in a small rural school or a small urban school as they can be in an inner-city school or on an island. One does not need to be fixed in a particular postal address box to be educationally disadvantaged. This is the point the teachers and I are making. If one likens it to learning support and resource, can one imagine the hullabaloo that would occur if the Department said that only DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools were to get learning support and resources. There would be uproar from parents and rightly so. This programme works. We saw children last Friday from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds and diverse backgrounds. They had very little in common other than the difficulty they had in their early capture of literacy. The programme worked. It does not matter whether one is the child of a millionaire in Sandymount or the child of an unemployed person in Ballydehob. It is a very short programme held during the late part of senior infants and the early part of first class. The Minister referred to second class and she is dead right because that is the point where these issues are measured. That is the point when the MICRA-T and the SIGMA-T are administered in schools and the child is essentially categorised as needing learning support and resource or not. It is too late at that stage, which is why I am asking that every child, regardless of where they come from, their parents' occupation or their school, would have access to a programme like this that will allow them to enjoy what the rest of take for granted, namely, the ability to pick up something and read it independently.

I have been to a lot of primary schools where I have seen children in a variety of programmes, including Reading Recovery, that are focused on small groups of children - I know that in this case, it is one to one - and that ensure they have the opportunity at that very early and crucial stage to learn how to read. I agree with the Deputy that it is a very basic skill that every person in the country should have. I think the Deputy said there are seven Reading Recovery teacher leaders in place currently. They deliver the training to teachers so the teachers go out and work in the schools. I will certainly look at those numbers. Obviously, it would be subject to finding the resources. I certainly agree with the Deputy that it is a programme that has delivered very good results so we will have a look at it.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of post offices. I express my disappointment that a question I had tabled to the Minister earlier was disallowed for some technical reason. It should have been answered. The interim report on post offices has just been released. Its authors have analysed all of the relevant issues. I wish to make a number of comments on the report. The Department of Social Protection has changed its policy such that forms sent from it are encouraging people not to uses post offices. The whole-of-government approach, from which this decision emanates, was announced prior to the European and local elections in 2014. Mr. Bobby Kerr took over stewardship of the review of the post office network in February this year. While I welcome the work he has done, surely if there is a whole-of-government approach, it cannot be right for the Department to distribute forms which suggest the post office network should not be the first port of call for the collection of social welfare payments. That is a very dangerous step. Social welfare payments and the fees payable thereon are the fundamental rock on which the post office network rests. It is totally unacceptable, therefore, for the Government to talk ad nauseam about the importance of ensuring the future of the post office network while the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection is authorising her Department to undermine the network in such a shameful way. We had a Topical Issues debate on the post office network some time ago during which the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, said the aforementioned forms would not be sent, but that is far from the truth because they are now circulating. The report makes reference to everyone having a post office within 5 km of his or her home and the fact that we should take this as a basic prerequisite for the future of the post office network. An Post must be obliged, through changes to its memorandum of understanding, to maintain the network as constituted. We have been talking for years about processing motor tax payments in post offices. Responsibility for processing driving licence application forms should have been given to post offices. All Departments should endeavour to increase the number of transactions completed through the post office network.  An Post operates savings and other financial accounts and handles large amounts of money. The main banks have left large tracts of rural Ireland without financial services. Much of the media debate has focused on the move to the digital age and the increased use of the Internet and the challenge this poses for the post office network. The network should be the point of contact between the State and local communities. We must examine in detail what financial services could be offered through the network and An Post should continue to process social welfare payments. It is not good enough for one arm of government to direct people towards banks. They should be able to access their money through An Post in the same way as they would in any bank. The report outlines the challenges that lie ahead. We are at a crossroads in the case of the post office network. We must decide as a people and a state that we are going to support post offices in tangible ways that will have a meaningful effect.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the day the initial report of the post office network business development group has been published for consultation. I established the group which is led by the entrepreneur Bobby Kerr in January to explore commercial and public service opportunities to secure the future of the post office network. It has found that a disproportionate amount of business is conducted in relatively few of the country's 1,140 post offices. Two thirds of all transactions are conducted in 300 post offices, while a further 48% of post offices account for just 12% of total business. In addition, the post office network is hugely reliant on two contracts, one with the Department of Social Protection and the other with the NTMA. Changing consumer preferences mean that many consumers do not go to the post office any more. The way in which people do business has changed markedly in recent years. This means that post offices must continue to diversify and modernise in order to provide the services that will attract customers. The business development group makes the point that post offices have the potential to thrive if they diversify into areas such as financial services, public service delivery and white labelling. In the coming weeks the group will explore these business areas further. An Post remains a trusted brand the length and breadth of the country, with 1,140 active company and contractor-operated post offices and 128 postal agents. Approximately 65% of post offices are located in rural areas where they provide important services for local communities. Despite the challenges faced by post offices, the number of closures has fallen dramatically during the lifetime of the Government. There were 24 net closures between 2011 and 2014 compared with 198 between 2007 and 2010. I encourage everyone interested in maintaining the relevance of the post office network to communities to take the opportunity to respond with their views and suggestions during the consultation period which opened today and which will run until 28 July. The initial report and the consultation questions are available on my Department's website. This is a real chance to have an input into the workings of the business development group and represents the best opportunity to place the post office network on a sustainable footing for the future. I look forward to receiving the final report of the group which I expect to receive later this year.

The most recent was in Milford in north Cork. I made an enormous effort, with officials of An Post, to try to maintain that post office. It was a retrograde step for the community there that the post office franchise was not readvertised. Has the Minister and officials of his Department met the board of An Post recently? An Post seems to be content to let the network to die out. It is not making any effort to go after new business or offer new products to attract new customers. Has the Minister and his officials met the board with a view to exploring new business opportunities? Has the board taken any initiative in the past year or so in that regard? The Minister announced the whole-of-government approach in April last year and appointed Mr. Bobby Kerr to lead the business development group in January this year. My party will be making a very strong submission in response to the initial report. Has the Minister told the board that he does not want to see more post offices closing and that the company should aggressively go after new business and make sure it is relevant in the digital age in which we live? Communities are desperate to ensure their post offices will be maintained. They believe that if they lose their post office, they will lose the heart of their communities. Where post offices have closed, the heartbeat of communities has been lost. Has the Minister and his officials met the board of An Post recently to challenge it on what it is doing? Postmasters are very concerned about their futures. As elected Members, we must reflect this view very strongly and make sure there will be a viable post office network.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	I have met the chairman, the chief executive and the board of An Post. As the Deputy may be aware, Mr. Christoph Mueller has decided to retire from the position of chairman.We are now in the process of appointing a new chair of An Post, which will happen in the coming weeks. I look forward to the new chair being appointed and the opportunity I will undoubtedly then have to engage with him or her on these important issues. There is ongoing contact between my officials and An Post on these questions. I reject any suggestion that the policy of either the Government or An Post is to let the post office network fizzle out, to use the phrase the Deputy used. There is no such approach, belief or policy. We cannot conjure up business for post offices; we have to work on it and have a plan to do it. We have to have the kind of expert advice and input that Mr. Bobby Kerr is bringing to the process. We have to have people's ideas and experiences. I look forward to hearing the Deputy's proposals and other proposals from across the House as to the practical steps we can take to allow An Post to attract business, which I have no doubt it can. I have huge confidence in An Post as being a terrific organisation with marvellous roots in communities throughout the country. However, we need to work in a systematic way to ensure business is brought into An Post both from the public sector and the private sector. I am sure we all have the same interests here. I might be allowed to remark that it is a pity that four, five or six years ago the then Government did not anticipate the kinds of problems we are seeing now. I suggest it would have been possible to anticipate the change in consumer patterns and the manner in which people do business, both in rural and urban areas. It is a pity that some of this work was not done by the previous Government. At least we are now grappling with this issue in a systematic way. We have had very few post office closures compared with the period when the Deputies opposite were in government. However, the key thing is for us all to work together in a practical and pragmatic way to attract activity into post offices. I am happy to say Mr. Bobby Kerr is leading that process. He gave us the interim report today and I look forward to the discussion on that interim report and then the final report in September.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, for his presence here to deal with this issue. Like many of my constituents in Dublin Bay North, I have major concerns about the presence of lead in the water supply. Many of those people are concerned about the negative health effects of lead in the water, in particular that the consumption of lead can affect brain development in young children. Babies in the womb are most at risk according to the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is an issue that is being raised frequently on the doorsteps in Dublin Bay North. We know that lead was predominantly used in service connections to buildings and in internal plumbing up to the 1970s. The maximum allowable limit which was 50 micrograms per litre in 2003 was reduced to 10 micrograms per litre in December 2013. It is very unfair that we are asking householders to pay water charges when they are getting the advice that their water is not fit for consumption and they are advised to run their taps for a considerable length of time to flush out their supply before consumption. The Government needs to consider this when it comes to charging people who find themselves in this unfortunate situation. Some households in Raheny and Clontarf in particular have lead levels far in excess of the EU limit. In one house on Watermill Drive it was measured at 825 micrograms per litre which was massively over the limit of 10 micrograms per litre. People are rightly concerned about their and their children's health. They want the matter addressed urgently by Government. The residents' committee in St. Anne's estate in Dublin Bay North has contacted the Minister to seek a meeting. It is doing everything to help the local residents. The Minister might see it fit to meet those residents who seem to have the highest level of lead in their water supply.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	Last week the Minister, Deputy Kelly, informed us that up to 200,000 houses were taking water through lead pipes and that the content of lead contaminating water is at a level that requires those pipes to be replaced. He assured the public that he had prepared and would shortly announce a programme of rectification which would be funded in part-grant form, similar to the septic tank grant qualification method and said funding would be available from January. On the face of it, this seemed positive, but past experience convinced me to check it out. I raised this issue in June 2014 following the Government's decision to proceed with Irish Water along the lines of Fine Gael's 2009 NewERA document. The then Minister, Commissioner Hogan, had given the distinct impression that a first-fix policy was inclusive of all possibilities. When I asked for confirmation about lead pipes, the answer was not quite forthcoming, possibly because we were facing into a charging scenario that would not be along the lines of €400, €500 or €600 per house and so Irish Water felt it would not have such an extensive first-fix policy. Last Wednesday I attended Irish Water's clinic in the House with some specific questions further to what the Minister had said. For example, I asked a senior Irish Water official to outline the methodology used to arrive at the figure of 200,000. Was there any scientific basis for the figure? Was there any breakdown of pre-1962 buildings? Was there any breakdown on the villages, towns and cities which have predominantly pre-1962 mixed-use buildings with lead piping? The senior Irish Water official told me there was no scientific basis and no specific methodology was used even though there was ample time and notice of this predicament. I then asked if there was any correlation between this figure and the metering programme, because the Minister had specifically said it was related. I had feared that was an attempt to justify the €540 million that had been spent on the metering programme with no obvious benefit in the immediate or near future. The answer again was "No". On the basis of a senior official disputing what the Minister had said, what proposals is he putting to Cabinet in the absence of any methodology or scientific basis for the argument over the amount of pipes that need rectification? That being the case, how can he give a commitment to the people that funding will be in place next January when he has no indication of the extent of that funding, considering he wants to use the methodology used for the septic-tank grant system?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to outline the position on the matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Kelly. With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water has been responsible for public water services. Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulation 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 micrograms per litre, which came into effect in December 2013. The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with the drinking water regulations. In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. A case-by-case approach will be considered by Irish Water, in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA. I understand that lead exceedances in the Dublin Bay North constituency have been reported to the EPA arising from samples taken at individual private dwellings. The EPA has indicated to my Department that in each case its investigations have concluded that the appropriate actions were taken and advice was given to the householders concerned. No water restriction has issued under the drinking water regulations to consumers in either of the areas in question. Irish Water has informed my Department that, having over recent months replaced the approximately 2 km of water mains which contained lead, no part of its estimated 60,000 km of distribution system now contains lead. However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme.The number of houses currently identified as affected stands at 5%, but this figure is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared lead backyard service connections and it has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily service pipes, including shared backyard service connections, over the next ten years. Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure it can mitigate the risk in the short term. In line with the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for the maintenance and replacement of the water mains and public side service pipes to the boundary of the property lies with Irish Water or the water supplier, while the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance from the boundary, including the internal plumbing. Last week, the Government approved a national strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water. The strategy was prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health, Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA to assess the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risks to human health posed by lead in drinking water. Following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will announce details of a grant scheme to assist low-income households with the replacement of lead pipes in their homes and he expects that householders will be able to avail of grants later this year.

Families who find themselves in this situation, particularly those with young children, are very concerned about the quality of the drinking water coming into their homes and they require help urgently. A residents committee from the St. Anne's estate, set up to provide information on this situation to householders, contacted the Minister in January asking if it would be possible for an alternative water supply to be provided to their area until such time as the new pipes have been installed and that all of the water in their area, which had the highest reading of 825 micrograms per litre, be tested. Will the Minister meet the committee from the St. Anne's estate in an effort to set their minds at ease? Replacement of lead pipes is expected to cost €5,000, which is a substantial amount. Not every family has that amount of money. While I welcome the proposed introduction of a grant scheme, as an income limit of €75,000 per household applies, not every household will qualify for the grant. While I accept that Irish Water proposes to replace all lead piping over a ten-year period, any householder who undertakes replacement of pipes servicing their homes will still face problems from the public side because work in that regard might not be completed for up to ten years. Can the Minister of State provide any reassurance to the families concerned?
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	I, too, thank the Minister of State for his response, on foot of which I have further question. In regard to the Minister's statement that the Government has approved a national strategy to deal with this issue on foot of the scale of the problem having been quantified by various Departments in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, will the Government publish the methodology and scientific basis of that quantification? Perhaps then we would get a indication of what level of funding the Government is providing in the coming year to deal with this issue. In regard to the grant assistance scheme, in particular in relation to septic tanks, if a constituent comes to me and tells me that his septic tank is overflowing and that it is possibly polluting the watercourse, which, because there is an underground water source in my county, is very possible, I will inform him that a grant scheme has been introduced by Government in respect of which he must apply to the local authority. If, following application to the local authority, he is refused the grant on the basis that to qualify for it his water supply must first fail a test initiated by the local authority on foot of the Government's instruction and he then asks that that test be carried out, the authority might refuse to do so on the basis that the test is only carried out on supply drawn by lots. While there might be 5,000 registered septic tanks in the county of Offaly, only ten inspections will take place. This is akin to having to match six numbers in the lotto to have a test carried out in the first instance before being eligible to apply for the grant. Irish Water has washed its hands of this. If in the scenario outlined there is no grant available, who will pay? The public will eventually pay because Irish Water, the local authorities and the Government are not doing anything to prevent this happening. This is the result of the preparation that went into the establishment of Irish Water in the first instance, prior to which responsibility for all matters such as this lay with the local authorities. To say that things have improved is, unfortunately, not the case. I hope a great deal more thought will be put into any proposal in relation to grant aid to deal with this issue in order that it might actually do what it says on the tin.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	While not wishing to engage in political point-scoring across the House, this is another legacy issue with which this Government has had to deal. These lead pipes have been in existence for generations. Unfortunately, there has been no investigation heretofore of the level now under way, which is a great pity. The matter is now being addressed. I am sure Deputies opposite and all Deputies will welcome that the Minister has given a commitment to introduce a grant scheme to assist low-income households in replacing lead piping. With effect from 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation and national, regional and local levels, including the delivery of the water services capital infrastructure. Irish Water has indicated that its records show that there is no lead water mains in the system and, therefore, the drinking water leaving treatment plants and distributed to the public water mains meets the requirements of the drinking water regulations in relation to lead. As part of its metering programme, Irish Water has identified significant numbers of lead service connections between the public mains and the customer stopcock and water meter. Irish Water is committed to replacing these over time. In the case of privately owned premises, the property owners are responsible for maintenance of the internal plumbing. In a joint position paper on lead, published by the Environmental Protection Agency and Health Service Executive in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership be replaced over time. The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system. A key objective of the national strategy to which I referred is to raise public awareness of potential public health issues arising from the risk of lead in drinking water. As part of that strategy, I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist low-income households in replacing lead pipes in their homes. The scheme will be administered by the local authorities and be in line with drinking water regulations. The available resources will be prioritised to those areas of highest risk, which is only fair. Funding in 2016 for this measure will be finalised in the context of the coming budget.

The primary background to this Bill is the housing supply shortage, which is one of the most pressing and important challenges facing society and the Government. This supply shortage is especially acute in Dublin, where demand for housing well outstrips supply and has done for a number of years, with consequential knock-on effects for house prices and rents, which impacts negatively on thousands of households. As Members will be aware, in May 2014 the Government published a comprehensive Construction 2020 strategy for a renewed construction sector encompassing 75 specific actions aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and at ensuring any critical bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential demand, as well as non-residential commercial demand, are addressed. I have responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the Construction 2020 strategy on behalf of the Government, which is central to restoration of growth in our economy and growth in employment. The construction sector is one of the sectors which was most adversely affected by the economic downturn. In line with the significant decrease in employment in the sector, the level of housing completions has also reduced significantly since the downturn. To put this in context, at the peak of construction activity in 2006, more than 93,000 houses were built nationally, which in hindsight was an unsustainably high level, with 19,000 of these being built in Dublin.By 2013 the number of housing completions had plummeted to a mere 8,000 units nationally, with just 1,200 of these being constructed in Dublin, an unsustainably low level of completions. We need to reverse this scenario and generate increased activity, with a view to increasing the number of house completions over a number of years in order to return to market equilibrium, where housing supply equals demand and where the sector operates at a more sustainable level in line with what one would expect in a well performing economy.  Since publication of the Construction 2020 strategy last year, we have begun to see some positive signs of recovery in the sector. The number of housing completions rose to 11,000 nationally in 2014, an increase of 30% on the 2013 figure, with just over 3,000 of these completions being in Dublin, while a further increase in activity is expected in the current year. However, we still have some way to go to overcome the current housing supply shortage. Taking account of household formation patterns which are changing, recent studies have estimated that in order to meet projected housing demand, we need to be building approximately 25,000 houses nationally on an annual basis, with between 8,000 and 10,000 of these being completed in Dublin. Further to action 2 of the Construction 2020 strategy, a housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin, comprising representatives of the four Dublin local authorities and other relevant stakeholders, was established, with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues in the Dublin area. The initial report of the group indicates that there are sufficient existing planning permissions or applications with no insurmountable infrastructural deficits with the potential, if acted on by developers, to supply almost 21,000 residential units in the Dublin area. The challenge now is to ensure the stock of existing permissions is activated and the associated housing supply materialises. While some of the barriers to activating these permissions appear to be financial and economic, the measures included in the Bill are designed to ensure perceived barriers to housing supply from a planning perspective will be addressed. These measures will not on their own solve the housing supply problems which are, unquestionably, multifaceted and require a broad-ranging co-ordinated approach, but the intention is that they will help to make a start in addressing these problems. The main provisions in the Bill relate to amendments to the Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Acts to support the provision of social housing; the introduction of revised arrangements for the application of development contributions by planning authorities; and the introduction of a new measure, a vacant site levy, to incentivise the development of vacant, under-utilised sites in urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes. These main provisions are set out in five Parts, comprising 36 sections in total. Part 1 of the Bill, sections 1 and 2, contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title of the Bill, collective citation with existing planning Acts, construction and commencement. It also incorporates some standard definitions.  Part 2 which forms a substantial part of the Bill comprises sections 3 to 26, inclusive, and relates to the proposed introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise the development of vacant sites in central urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes. This proposal follows from action 23 of the Construction 2020 strategy. In other areas of interaction between public policy making for the common good and property rights the courts have determined that private property rights may be counterbalanced where there is a need to address matters of pressing or compelling concern and the wider community good. Examples in this regard include the Derelict Sites Act 1990, the derelict site levy and the Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Acts relating to social and affordable housing. In effect, there is already a legal precedent for measures of this nature impacting on private property which are socially desirable and in the overall common good. The Bill contains number of changes to the vacant site levy provisions compared to the general scheme which was published some months ago, all of which are intended to make the provisions as fair, reasonable and proportionate as possible. Essentially, it now proposes that, from 1 January 2019, planning authorities will be empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% to the market value of vacant sites which a planning authority has determined were vacant or idle in the preceding year. The sites liable to the levy will be in designated areas identified by the planning authority in its development or local area plan for residential or regeneration development. Section 3 provides for definitions of terms used in the context of the vacant site levy provisions such as "housing", "market value" and "owner". Section 4 outlines that the vacant site levy provisions shall apply to residential or regeneration land, other than land owned by a local authority for housing purposes.  Section 5 is central to the vacant site levy provisions in that it provides for the definition of a vacant site which shall be residential or regeneration land as zoned by a planning authority in its local development or local area plan. In the case of residential land, this means a site in an area where there is a need for housing which is suitable for the provision of housing and is vacant. In the case of regeneration land, it means a site that is vacant and has an adverse effect on the existing amenities or character of the area. A vacant site will be any area of land exceeding 0.1 ha but which does not include a structure that is a person's home. Rather than go through the remaining sections of the vacant site levy provisions individually, sections 6 to 26, inclusive, which are quite complex and detailed, I will instead give a summary of the provisions in order that Deputies can obtain a better understanding of how the proposed scheme will operate. Beginning on 1 January 2017, a planning authority shall establish and maintain a register of sites, the vacant sites register, of lands zoned for residential or regeneration use which, in the planning authority's opinion, were vacant sites during the preceding year. Before 1 June 2018, a planning authority shall issue a notice to the owner of a vacant site included in its respective vacant sites register indicating that such site owner shall be charged a levy in respect of 2018 in January 2019, with such charge to be continued every year thereafter until the site is no longer vacant. A planning authority shall, as soon as possible after the entry of a site on the vacant sites register and at least every three years thereafter, determine the market value of a vacant site and serve notice on the owner of the site of the valuation, or revised valuation, of the site in question which may be appealed to the Valuation Tribunal. A planning authority, or the Valuation Tribunal on appeal, may, where it considers it appropriate, deem that a vacant site has a zero market value where there is no market for the site or it is on contaminated land and the estimated necessary remediation costs in order to use or develop it exceed its market value. With effect from 1 January 2019 and every year thereafter, a planning authority shall, in respect of the preceding year, charge a vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of a site on the owner of each site included in its vacant site register, which shall be payable on demand or by instalments if agreed by the planning authority. To help to alleviate the financial burden faced by the owners of vacant sites which are subject to a site loan, a zero rate of levy shall apply if the outstanding amount of the site loan is greater than the market value of the vacant site on the date of its determination. This is to address site owners in negative equity who may have purchased sites in the boom years. Where the outstanding amount of the site loan is between 75% and 100% of the market value of the vacant site on the date of its determination, a reduced rate of 0.75% shall apply. Where the outstanding amount of the site loan is between 50% and 75% of the market value of the vacant site on the date of its determination, a 1.5% rate shall apply. The vacant site levy shall remain a charge on the relevant land until it is paid. Where there is a change in ownership of a vacant site, or the owner of a site dies, the amount of levy chargeable on such sites in respect of that year or the previous year shall be zero. This shall not apply where ownership of the vacant site transfers from one company to an associated company, to another member of the family, other than on the death of the owner, or for the principal purpose of avoiding the obligation to pay the vacant site levy. The vendor of a vacant site on the register shall, before the completion of a sale of the site, pay to the relevant planning authority any vacant site levy due in respect of that site. Moneys received by a planning authority in respect of a vacant site levy shall be spent by it on the provision of housing or the regeneration of the area. Regeneration expenditure can include the preservation and protection of structures of special architectural, historical or cultural interest, the provision or improvement of educational, recreational or cultural facilities for the local community and projects or works to improve local shopping streets and business areas. In line with fair procedures, numerous opportunities are provided for site owners to make submissions and appeals to planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Valuation Tribunal on the proposed inclusion of a site in the vacant sites register, the annual notices of levy liability, the market valuation arrived at for a site and the annual demand for payment of the levy.Part 3 comprises just one section, section 27. This amends section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 to provide that a derelict site levy shall not be payable in respect of any land in respect of which the vacant site levy is payable under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, when enacted. That is to ensure a double payment situation does not arise in respect of the vacant site levy or derelict site levy. Part 4 deals with two separate issues, namely, local authority development plans and development contribution charges applied by local authorities. With regard to development plans, section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 outlines the objectives that planning authorities are required to take into account in the preparation and adoption of development plans for their respective areas. Those include the zoning of land for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational and other uses in line with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area; the provision of necessary infrastructure to facilitate development; and the preservation of structures of historical interest as well as the character of the landscape of the area. Section 28 amends section 10(2) of the 2000 Act to provide that the current objective incorporated in a development plan for the development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration should be broadened to provide that such objective should be for the explicit purpose of preventing adverse effects on existing amenities in such areas, urban blight and decay, anti-social behaviour, or a shortage of habitable houses or land suitable for residential use or a mixture of residential or other uses. This amendment is necessary to support the vacant site levy provisions - elaborating on the principles and policies relating to the levy - and outlines the basis for identifying lands as being in need of regeneration for the purposes of being so designated in a local development plan. With regard to development contribution charges, these are generally used towards the provision of necessary public infrastructure such as new roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces and car parking to service new developments. In line with action 14 of the Construction 2020 strategy, section 29 amends section 48 of the 2000 Act to provide that where a new development contribution scheme is adopted by a planning authority to provide for reduced development contribution levies compared with those which were in place under the previous development scheme, the reduced development contributions under the newly adopted scheme shall have retrospective effect for existing planning permissions that have yet to be activated. In addition, section 29 provides that where there are unsold housing units in a development, the new lower development contribution scheme shall also apply to those unsold housing units. Section 30 amends section 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide that the arrangements in relation to reduced development contributions will also apply in respect of supplementary development contribution schemes which are sometimes deployed for the purpose of facilitating a particular infrastructure project in a local authority area such as a new motorway intersection which will directly benefit the development on which it is imposed. These changes to the development contribution provisions should assist in reducing costs for developers, make developments more economically viable and influence developments to be brought forward sooner than might otherwise be the case and at a lower cost, which is critical in terms of improving housing supply. The final Part of the Bill, Part 5, relates to amendments to the existing Part V provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000 concerning social and affordable housing. In this regard, action 9 of the Construction 2020 strategy called for a review of the Part V requirements with a view to ensuring it is delivering as intended, and the bringing forward of any legislative changes deemed necessary. In this regard, the original Part V housing supply provisions in section 93 of the 2000 Act have played a significant role in the delivery of social and affordable housing since their introduction. There are many people in good quality housing today as a result of the Part V mechanisms. Furthermore, Part V has been successful in delivering social integration and more sustainable mixed tenure developments throughout the country. That was one of the of the positive outcomes of the original Part V arrangements. However, the economic context within which the original Part V provisions were developed in 2000 has changed, as has the mix of housing need. The capacity of Part V to deliver on its objectives is related to the level of housing construction activity. Accordingly, since the downturn and the decreased construction activity associated with it, Part V has delivered very little in terms of social housing in recent years. Notwithstanding that, in the context of a recovering housing market and increasing housing construction activity, it is considered that the Part V mechanism, with appropriate adjustments, has the potential to again be a significant contributor to future social housing provision. From the Government's perspective, it remains proper that the gain to developers derived from the planning system should contribute towards meeting the housing needs of citizens, including those on local authority housing lists. Informed by an extensive public consultation process and an in-depth review of the Part V provisions, the Bill provides for a series of amendments to the operation of the Part V provisions, with the principal objectives of enhancing the economic viability of developments, maximising the opportunity for the delivery of social housing units, securing the principle of integrated mixed tenure developments, and addressing weaknesses in aspects of the existing legislation identified in a number of court judgments. The proposed provisions will also be a key component of the range of delivery mechanisms that will be required to achieve the targets set out in the Government's Social Housing Strategy 2020. My Department estimates that in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered by 2020 using the new Part V provisions which will be a significant contribution to the ambitious social housing targets set out in the strategy. Upon enactment of the Bill, the new Part V arrangements can also be retrospectively applied to existing planning permissions where works have not commenced. In the operation of the revised Part V arrangements, the priority will be to secure social housing units on site. The current practice of developers making cash payments in lieu of social housing is to be discontinued. I will now outline the key changes to Part V in some more detail. Section 31 amends section 94 of the 2000 Act by requiring a planning authority to consult approved
housing bodies in its functional area in the preparation of its housing strategy and to have regard to relevant housing policies of the Government or any Minister. It also halves to 10%, from 20%, the percentage of land that must be provided for social and affordable housing in a housing development. With regard to affordable housing, Deputies will be aware that the general scheme of the Bill, as published some months ago, proposed that the existing statutory provisions relating to affordable housing would be removed from the Statute Book. However, after further consideration, in particular following the contributions made during the scrutiny of the general scheme by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Government now proposes that the existing statutory provisions relating to affordable housing will be retained in the Planning and Development Act in order that when the current acute need for social housing has been met, it may be possible to reintroduce the affordability aspect into the Part V arrangements when and if required. Up to now, Part V has been perceived as an inefficient process which caused difficulties for developers and local authorities alike. Under the existing arrangements, any Part V agreements are required to be reached within an eight-week period, but in practice that was rarely achieved. Accordingly, section 33(1)(a) will now require a Part V agreement to be reached between the developer and the local authority prior to the commencement of works on a development. That is to be notified by the lodgement of a commencement notice to the planning authority by a developer, which will reduce the opportunity for negotiations to become protracted beyond commencement stage, as has generally occurred up to now. Sections 33 and 34 amend the options contained in section 96 of the 2000 Act with a view to maximising the provision of completed social housing units by a developer. The transfer of land to a local authority for the provision of social housing will remain the default option, as is currently the case. However, the option of making a cash payment to a local authority in lieu of social housing is being removed, as is the option of providing sites or land elsewhere. The transfer of completed social housing units off-site on other lands, however, will be allowed in specific circumstances, for instance, where there is insufficient social housing demand at the location of the proposed development and where there is greater need at another location. Provision is also being made for the Part V obligation to be fulfilled by developers through long-term leasing of properties and rental accommodation availability agreements. The complexity and ambiguity of some wording within the original Act has resulted in several significant court cases.Accordingly, a number of technical amendments are being provided take account of court judgments and practical difficulties reported in the operation of Part V. These include the provision of greater clarity on the meaning of terms such as "attributable costs" and "equivalent monetary value". These amendments are intended to improve the Part V negotiation process for all parties. Section 36 amends section 97 of the original Act of 2000 to provide that the social and affordable housing obligations on developers shall in future apply only in respect of developments consisting of ten or more houses. Currently, developers are exempted from Part V obligations in respect of developments consisting of four or fewer houses. On Committee Stage, I will bring forward a number of technical amendments primarily relating to the Part V provisions which are required to remove any doubt regarding the application of provisions relating to the charging of rents. The Bill contains a number of fundamental, important and necessary revisions to the Planning Act of 2000, all emanating from the Government's Construction 2020 strategy and all aimed at increasing housing supply. The amendments to the Part V provisions and those providing for reduced development contributions will in particular help in reducing costs for developers and removing disincentives to construction, thereby making developments more economically viable and helping to increase housing supply. As a major employer, the performance of our construction sector is central to Ireland's economic recovery and well-being, and the measures in the Bill should assist in stimulating jobs in the construction sector, as well as in the manufacturing, retail and professional sectors that it supports. The other main measure proposed in the Bill, the vacant site levy, has a positive objective to incentivise the development of vacant, underutilised lands for housing and for regeneration with a view to breathing life back into designated urban areas and addressing urban decay. All the measures proposed in the Bill - the Part V revisions, reduced development contributions and the vacant site levy - are socially and economically desirable and serve the overall common good. I commend the Bill to the House and would like it to refer it to the Select Sub-Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	While many elements of the Bill are welcome, we will oppose it unless amendments are accepted that protect and maintain Part V obligations at 20%. I urgently request sufficient time for a meaningful debate on housing in general. Inaction or poor action on the part of the Government has sleepwalked the State into a housing crisis that many would describe as a national scandal. Up to 100,000 people are on housing waiting lists and it is not necessarily a true reflection of the real housing needs. Despite the fact that we might not agree wholeheartedly with everything the Minister of State says, he was right to say that housing is in short supply. The rental sector is in crisis. More than 1,000 children live in emergency accommodation in Dublin and beyond. Although there is massive demand for social and private housing, there is no supply. There are people in rental accommodation who can barely get by and who cannot and will not, in their present circumstances, qualify for a mortgage or, more alarmingly and worryingly, for a local authority housing list. They cannot necessarily qualify for rent allowance, housing assistance payment or rental assistance schemes. In other words, the State is providing no solution for them. Another cohort of people is those in severe mortgage difficulty who, we have recently been told, have been asked to sacrifice their homes in exchange for an assurance from their financial institutions that they will not be pursued for the negative equity. This is based on the assumption that they qualify for social housing and are placed on a local authority housing list. The problem is, they do not and will not qualify for the housing lists. Many Deputies regularly meet people in this bind. Yesterday, 60% of those who visited my clinics had housing issues. One couple told me they were paying €650 per month in rent with one person working and earning €35,000 per year and three children. They have the costs associated with rearing and seeking to provide a home for those three children, including school, medical expenses, transport, clothes, food and heat. They are on the bread line and depend on family for assistance. They ask what solution, resolution, options or prospect they have of being assisted by the State. Would it not be right and proper for them to qualify for a local authority house that might cost approximately €300 in rent per month? This would ease the burden on them and the locality in which they reside by offering €300 extra into the local economy. However, there is no available mechanism by which they can be helped or resourced by the State, given that the qualifying income for such a couple to be eligible for a housing list, irrespective of their personal outgoings and the percentage of their income available to put towards rent, is €28,000. These figures have not been amended since 2011, although the crisis has worsened to a great extent since then. This is just one example. There are many others, which we could all relate. The problem is that we are considering old solutions and ways of doing things and not asking everybody who is in here with a responsibility to provide solutions to engage in a meaningful debate that might bring about resolutions and proposals on which everybody could agree and for which funding could be sought. This is the greatest, gravest issue facing society. I am not alone in my constituency. The Government's proposals to deal with the issue in Offaly as regards the Government, Department or local authorities being funded in a way in which they can provide units is 33 over the next three years. There is a waiting list of over 2,000, and that is just those who qualify. As I said earlier, if 100,000 people are on housing lists, there is a forgotten cohort that should also be on a housing list or be in a position to be helped, resourced and accommodated by the State. That could bring it up to 150,000. In the county I represent, it would probably increase the list to 3,000. Meanwhile, the State plans to provide 33 units. This is why the House needs to have a serious debate. As I said earlier, we accept and support many elements of the Bill, however there must be a greater holistic approach to this problem, crisis and scandal. There must be a twin-track approach by private and public sectors. Whether people like it or not, the Government must offer solutions to allow the private sector to provide homes.The pillar banks are not in a position to lend or they are not willing to lend. We were promised a strategic investment bank. A home investment bank should also be established to finance housing construction. The proposal to reduce the 20% social housing obligation to 10% to encourage private developers does not go far enough. If we do nothing about the people to whom I referred, they will remain hidden from the statistics and reports brought before the House, and they will be forgotten. This crisis needs a radical response. It is not good enough to provide 33 units when there is a need for 2,200 in my county alone. The Government was aware of the problems in the public finances when it came to power. It promised that things would be done differently and that it would not necessarily follow the programmes developed by the previous Government in rectifying the public finances. As it turned out, it did much the same as its predecessor despite giving the impression that it would find a softer and easier way. During the first four years of its term, it allowed the housing crisis escalate into a national scandal. We need to take a two-pronged approach to this crisis. The Government needs to be proactive in encouraging private development. There are regular announcements on building programmes that will not have the necessary impact. We should have the opportunity to analyse and debate proposals to solve the crisis. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, should be available to respond to suggestions made in this House and his own proposals need to subjected to scrutiny in order that the public can be assured that everything is being done to address what has become a scandal. We have a housing crisis, a rental crisis and a lack of supply. We have heard the rhetoric in recent months but there is no recognition of the scale or human cost of this scandal because many of the people who should be included in the statistics are being ignored and forgotten. I ask the Minister of State to broaden the debate by setting aside time for Members on all sides of the House to bring forward proposals that he and his officials might, in their wisdom, implement sooner rather than later. The amendment to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is my main bone of contention with this Bill. I wholeheartedly disagree with the proposal to reduce the social housing obligation on developers from 20% to 10%, although I agree with the proposal to end the practice of cash in lieu. Between 2005 and 2011, Part V provisions yielded up to 15,000 units. That is no mean feat. The provision could have delivered more to the State, however, and with the necessary tweaks it will deliver more. I agree with the proposal to double the threshold from five to ten units before Part V becomes applicable. I do not agree with the proposal to remove the option of providing affordable housing. It should be a matter for local authorities to measure the availability of housing in their area against the demands on the waiting list. Affordable housing could help those who are not eligible for local authority housing because of their income levels. We will debate the need to amend these income thresholds on another occasion, but in the meantime, people who do not qualify for social housing might be able to purchase affordable housing with the assistance of local authority or private sector loans. The Government should also investigate the potential of a home development bank to address these issues. I support the vacant site levy in principle but we may bring amendments to the provision to reflect the differences between country towns and large cities. I am conscious of how many towns and villages were decimated because of the loss of retail trade and commercial activity and depend on outlying sites for the residential development they require. Local authorities need to be more adventurous in their development plans and more lenient in their zoning to allow mixed residential development on such sites. Existing derelict site legislation already allows local authorities to deal with properties, for example, by resolving any title issues that might be acting as an obstacle to development. I do not think they have made sufficient use of the existing legislation but I would welcome the provisions in this Bill if they strengthen their hand in this regard. I will be consulting local authorities in the coming days and weeks to find out why they have not used the existing legislation to deal with the problems of dereliction that exist in many of our towns and villages. Local authorities have made only limited use of compulsory purchase orders in recent years. When I first became a councillor 20 years ago, there was much more activity at a time when there were fewer residential developments. Perhaps we are in a similar situation now. There is an onus on the State and local authorities to assist towns and villages which are struggling to regain their vitality. The Government needs to provide the funding required to regenerate these areas. I welcome the provisions allowing local authorities to reduce development charges retrospectively to encourage development. Local authorities will be able to reduce development charges on sites with existing planning permission. This provision was introduced after a number of representations were made. While I welcome many aspects of the Bill, I hope a more holistic approach will be taken. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on his proposals in this regard. However, I would not kowtow to representations from CIF on this provision as a one-size-fits-all solution. I received representations from a private company which is seeking to construct housing for the elderly which would allow people to trade down.It told me that the 20% obligation in the mix would not be right. We have many elderly people on the housing list, too, who need accommodation to meet their current situation, which was not the case some years earlier. I acknowledge that it would be wrong for them to be disbarred from being in a community such as the private sector is providing. We have made proposals to assist developers in that area. For example, we would have a reduced capital gains tax for people who sell their homes to buy a home such as that when trading down. We would go further and have no property tax for five years to enable people to do so. That in itself is an incentive for people to make such a move. In doing so, they are leaving bigger homes available to those who wish to trade up. There must be a wider effort by the Government to adopt a parallel, twin-track approach to address these issues. Against that background, however, I commend the Minister of State on those elements of the Bill which I support. I hope that on Committee Stage we can debate, scrutinise and analyse the contents of the Bill with a view to gaining more universal support for it. Ultimately, we will be able to produce a Bill that is more effective and will meet the thrust of what the Minister of State set out in initially proposing the legislation. I respectfully ask the Minister of State to use his influence with his colleagues to provide time for a more wide-ranging debate on the current crisis in the housing sector, including rented property.

This Bill contains some positive steps which could be a lot stronger in some places but are none the less welcome. Unfortunately though, as in most cases when the Government gets something right in a Bill, it generally also gets something horribly wrong which is tacked on to the legislation making it unacceptable to the Opposition. The reform or further gutting of Part V in the Bill is just such a horrible mistake. Part V as it currently operates is a weakened version of the system introduced by Fianna Fáil. It was already in effect halved by this Government when it ended the affordable housing scheme in 2011. That scheme allowed local authorities to provide homes built by private developers for purchase by low-income families at below the market rate. This was a good scheme which worked well for many people priced out of the market who could never hope to avail of social housing as currently constituted. The original intent of Part V was much stronger than the one which finally made it onto the Statute Book. The scheme was flawed but was positive overall, despite the potential for misuse. Developers building five or more homes would have to provide 10% for social housing and 10% for affordable housing from that development. Local authorities are not just given these properties, of course, as they pay a price based on the apparent cost of the construction and land. This works out at below the market rate and represents a recoupment of expenses for the developer. When it worked, Part V provided mixed communities of council tenants, low-income families, and middle and higher-income families as well. However, it did not work when councils abused the system of contributions which could be paid to them instead of providing the housing. Developers also liked this option as they sometimes wanted to keep council tenants or lower-income families out of particular developments. Alternatively, they sometimes offered other places for these homes to be built, thus completely undermining the scheme's intention of ensuring these would be mixed communities. Despite these problems, thousands of homes were provided for social and affordable housing in the eight or so years during which Part V was fully operational. The ending of the affordable housing scheme caused an imbalance in the provisions of Part V. As a result, developers were only required to provide 10% social housing. This halving of the requirements on developers needed to be addressed. However, in its planned reforms the Government not only failed to do that but also gutted the entire provision, potentially making it almost meaningless. If the Government reforms pass, they will move Part V away from being a provision to ensure developers provide for low-income families in need of a home. It will become a scheme for the recoupment of some expenses by developers while they pretend to be contributing to a solution to the housing crisis. The new system removes the 10% affordable housing requirement, which addresses its suspension, but it also undermines the 10% requirement for social housing. The Labour Party may claim that a success has been achieved in removing the potential for a get-out clause in the form of contributions, but the get-out clause has simply been redefined. Now developers will not have to sell their properties for below market rates, but simply enter into social leasing agreements and have their properties returned to them in time, potentially with renovation costs covered by councils at a later date, as can happen in social leasing agreements. This means that the 10% social housing provision is not all that it seems. It is not a provision for social housing at all but simply provides more properties for tenants receiving rent support payments while not increasing the social housing stock by a single unit. With rental properties in such short supply, any extra homes for low-income families are welcome, but not at the expense of providing real social housing owned by local authorities and rented to tenants from waiting lists. Some 90,000 families are on those waiting lists and more than 1,000 children are in emergency accommodation. We need much stronger requirements on developers, not weaker ones. This Bill will also mean that many developers who were previously required to contribute to Part V will no longer have to do so. In the past, any development numbering more than four homes had to provide for social and affordable housing. Now it will only apply to developments of ten or more homes. If the Government was serious about getting developers to contribute to a solution to the housing crisis, it would be strengthening Part V, not making it weaker and less far-reaching. Under this Government the new scheme will apply to fewer developments, require half the homes, and will lead to costly leasing agreements in many cases which result in no increase in housing stock for councils. Ending contributions to get-out clauses is not good enough if one is just going to open up more get-out clauses and exemptions. This reform also presents a major challenge to the Government. If it is serious about providing more housing from this scheme, the Government will need to ensure councils have funding to buy these homes when they become available. Councils with long waiting lists must be provided with funds to purchase available homes. A situation cannot be allowed to arise where councils are passing on homes for purchase and renting them through social leasing instead. We have already spent nearly €500 million subsidising landlords and developers through the rental accommodation scheme, rent supplement, housing assistance payment and other leasing agreements. The main point of this Bill is one which I welcome, having called for such a measure in the past. A vacant site levy would be a positive move in encouraging the use of land which is zoned for housing, although it could be stronger. My major issue with it is the timeframe because the planned introduction of this levy is simply too far in the future. If the levy was at a very high rate I could understand the long lead-in period, as it might act as a more effective stick to move developers into action before the charge ever comes into place. The levy is very fair and reasonable, however, and I fear that too many developers will pay it for a period and delay putting their property into use. We are in the midst of a very serious housing crisis.Simply put, we cannot tolerate any longer developers allowing property which could provide housing to lie unused.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I intend to share time with Deputies Ruth Coppinger, Thomas Pringle and Catherine Murphy. It is now three and a half weeks since the tremendous result in the marriage equality referendum, which was heralded as a social revolution by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and others. More than 62% of those who cast a vote voted for marriage equality. Now, the House has the chance to vote for employment equality to go with it. The referendum result was a powerful blow against discrimination, inequality and homophobia. It showed that the traditional picture of a socially conservative majority in society is simply and fundamentally incorrect. It showed that immense social change has taken place and that this of itself becomes a pressure point for more change and progress. The gay rights campaigner, Harvey Milk, once said that hope will never be silent. Those who mobilised in the recent referendum campaign will not now be silent. The tens of thousands who registered to vote, who came home to vote and who campaigned to convince others to vote "Yes" will not now be silent and will continue to campaign. That Ireland was the first country to vote for marriage equality in a popular referendum sends a powerful signal throughout the world that marriage equality can be won and that change can happen. Moreover, it sends a signal for further change in this country. It remains the case that discrimination and homophobia continue in this State. We know that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer, LGBTQ, people are seven times more likely to attempt or commit suicide than straight people. We know that young LGBTQ people face much higher rates of depression and self-harm. We know that, according to a recent EU survey, half of LGBTQ people were discriminated against in the past 12 months because they were LGBTQ. Almost one in five were discriminated against in the workplace in the previous 12 months and 8% had been physically attacked or threatened with violence. The vast majority of that discrimination and harassment goes unreported because people believe nothing will be done about it and change will not happen. We know that discrimination, inequality and homophobia persist. While legal change cannot change all that in one fell swoop, it can send a signal that homophobia is not acceptable, as opposed to being enshrined in law. The ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men continues. It must be ended. We need gender recognition legislation that takes into account all the criticisms made by transgender people, including those under 18 years of age. We need this to be passed into law as soon as possible. In particular, and this is what this Bill from the Anti-Austerity Alliance is about, we need to end the incredible situation whereby church-run schools, hospitals or charitable institutions can discriminate against LGBTQ people, atheists, unmarried mothers, divorced people, minority faiths and others. Now is clearly the time to end all legal discrimination as a step towards real equality and a progressive secular State with separation of church and State. The infamous section 37 of the Employment Equality Act that we are trying to remove is particularly offensive. It functions as an exemption to the employment equality legislation. It allows a religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee to prevent them from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. This broad exemption covers thousands of workers in this State. It includes teachers, special needs assistants, nurses, doctors, health care assistants, charity workers and others. Given that close to 95% of our primary schools, 50% of our secondary schools and many of our hospitals are church-run, this is a particularly serious issue. The legal meaning of this section is to permit discrimination against workers to maintain the religious ethos of the institution. In practice, it means that LGBTQ teachers and atheist hospital workers can be legally discriminated against. It means that workers in a charitable institution who are unmarried mothers or who have relationships that may be deemed to be against the religious ethos of the Catholic Church can be legally discriminated against. It means they could be fired on those grounds without legal recourse to the equality legislation. It also means they could be and in fact are discriminated against in terms of promotion opportunities. Above all, it creates a chilling effect whereby LGBTQ workers, teachers in particular, are told not to be open about their sexuality. It adds to a socialising of homophobic attitudes and behaviour and cuts across those who attempt to intervene and stop homophobic bullying, for example. This is not a new issue. It originally arose in the Eileen Flynn case. Eileen Flynn was sacked in August 1982 because of her relationship with a separated man. The decision was then upheld by the courts. This section has been opposed by the teachers' unions since it was introduced. In 2012, the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, promised to get rid of it. A Bill amending section 37 has been stuck in the Seanad for over two years. The Minister of State with responsibility for equality, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, has not made the promised amendments yet and brought it forward. This is the first time this legislation has been brought on Second Stage in the Dáil. We have had enough of waiting for this, especially in the context of the referendum result. It is essential that this is gone in time before the new school year starts. I am pleased that the Bill has the support of a wide number of groups, including the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, the ASTI, the INTO, the TUI, Atheist Ireland, LGBT Noise and ICTU Youth. I will go through our Bill quickly. It is very simple. It deletes the exemption that currently exists. Instead, it clearly states that no religious organisation "may give less favourable treatment on gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, Traveller community, disability grounds or the ground of race to employees or prospective employees in services it operates including educational or medical institutions". This would mean the discrimination against LGBTQ employees and others in schools, hospitals and elsewhere would no longer be legal. It replaces the relevant subsection with a more limited wording which would allow a religious organisation itself, rather than a service it operates or directs, to discriminate in favour of an employee on the basis or grounds of religion alone, where it is a justified occupational requirement. For example, this would allow the Catholic Church to discriminate in favour of Catholics when employing priests. We have heard that the Government will not oppose this Bill and that is very welcome. We urge that it should not sit on the shelves after passing tomorrow night but that it should be quickly brought on to Committee Stage and enacted before the start of the next school term, which means before the summer break. In previous debates in the Seanad the argument has been made that change such as we have proposed would be unconstitutional. We do not believe that to be the case. The Constitution gives every religious denomination the right to manage its own affairs. It also says that the State shall not make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status. Furthermore, it states that all citizens shall be held equal before the law. These conflicting rights are contained in the Constitution and it is up to the Oireachtas to get the balance between those rights.As things stand, however, the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs, even extending to institutions they run, control or direct. Our Bill would shift that balance more in the direction of the right of workers to equality. However, it would continue to recognise the right of religions to manage their own affairs. In any case, if there are particular issues with the wording in the Bill, they can be dealt with by way of appropriate amendments on Committee Stage. Other Bills have been introduced in both the Dáil and Seanad which have attempted to address this issue. The Bill the Government has referred to repeatedly and which is on Committee Stage in the Seanad was introduced by Senator Ivana Bacik. That legislation would eliminate discrimination in publicly funded institutions, except on the grounds of religion where this is a "genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement". Although the Bill would represent an important step forward relative to the current situation, it is too limited. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has correctly described it as providing "a partial thaw in the chilling effect". The Bill has two key limitations. First, the fact it is limited to publicly funded institutions means church-run institutions which do not receive State funding could continue to discriminate on all the grounds. Employment rights should not depend on whether one's employer is in the private or public sector. Second, the Bill retains the grounds of religion as a means of discrimination, including in institutions run by religious denominations, as opposed to within the religious denominations themselves, where it is demonstrated to be necessary by the employer. This would mean a potential continuation of discrimination in schools, hospitals and charitable institutions. In particular, it would leave atheists open to discrimination and might also affect LGBTQ people and others who may be deemed to be in contravention of a particular set of religious beliefs. Also in the Seanad, Senator Averil Power introduced a Bill in 2012 which would likewise represent a big step forward over the current situation. Again, however, it does not propose to delete the relevant subsection of section 37. The existence of a right to discriminate on ethos grounds would remain even if it would be somewhat restricted. In the Dail, the Bill published by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien of Sinn Féin in February 2013 has the same issues. I return now to the more substantial points relating to this Bill. People mobilised and voted in significant numbers for marriage equality. It is time now to vote in this House for employment equality. There are those who ask what the big deal is in respect of section 37 given that no one has even been fired for being, for example, a gay teacher. The big deal, which is felt every day, is the chilling effect of the existing provision on employees in schools, hospitals and elsewhere. The big deal is the gay teacher who entered an online radio competition earlier this year to win a wedding online and felt obliged to pixelate her face in the video because she was nervous about being openly gay. As the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, said at the time: "People should be horrified to live in a country where people think they have to pixelate their faces in a competition to protect their jobs." According to The Irish Times, he followed up that comment by pledging to have the Employment Equality Acts changed by Easter. The big deal is those teachers who spoke out to thejournal.ie website last year about how they were shunned in school after being found out to be gay. They spoke of being dropped from training the football team, left isolated in the staffroom and feeling unable able to tackle homophobic bullying by students. It is a very big deal that we have laws in this country which allow discrimination against public sector workers. The Bill we are bringing forward is part of the movement for progressive social change, which is a demand being heard throughout the country in the light of the marriage equality referendum. Teachers, health workers or any other workers should not be discriminated against because of their sexuality, religion or for any reason. More fundamentally, we should not have any church controlling our education or health services. We need a secular society, with properly funded and State-provided public services. A secular society means everyone is perfectly entitled and free to practise whatever religion they want, with no interference from the State. Indeed, the State would defend their right to do so. It also would mean, however, a separation between the actions of a church and the actions of the State, without, as has happened since the foundation of this State, a church being relied upon to run and control vital public services. This Bill is an important step in that direction. It will remove the right of discrimination against LGBTQ people, atheists, people of minority religions, unmarried mothers and others. Passing it here will strike a blow for employment equality in keeping with the blow that was struck for marriage equality in the recent referendum. It must quickly be debated in committee and enacted as soon as possible. It needs to be done before another school year starts in September.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	The Government's decision to accept this Bill is extremely welcome. It is a tribute to the social movement that took place around the marriage equality referendum. Let us face it, if that referendum had not been passed in such a decisive way, we probably would not be having this debate or seeing the Government accepting the Bill. I take this opportunity to thank the teachers' unions, the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO, for their support for our Bill. I also thank the ICTU youth committee which issued a statement of support last night. I pay tribute, in particular, to the LGBTQ groups within the teacher unions. In referring to comments made by people in those groups, I wish to illustrate the degree of fear among teachers about coming out as gay or even having a non-conforming lifestyle. I speak as a member of ASTI and as someone who is aware of many cases of teachers who have hidden their sexuality. These people have had to suppress who they are while in work. We now have a situation where teachers can legally marry a person of the same sex but cannot go into the staffroom and talk openly about it or invite colleagues to their wedding for fear of negative consequences for their employment and promotion prospects. I have spoken to teachers who have told no one at their school they are gay and who continually check themselves in case anyone guesses. This is happening not just in rural areas but in our capital city right now. As my colleague mentioned, several gay teachers spoke to thejournal.ie about their experiences. That website did us all a service in reporting those interviews. One teacher spoke about being invited in on a Monday for a chat with the school principal and the chairman of the board, who is the local parish priest, after being seen in a particular pub with a person of the same sex. The remarks to this teacher were prefaced with an assurance that there was no intention to say the person could not be of a particular sexuality, but what was made clear was that the teacher could not be allowed to "promote that lifestyle" in the school. This is happening in our country in 2015. That teacher was isolated within the school, essentially bullied and obliged to give up some of the extracurricular activities in which the person was engaged with students. The silencing effect on gay and transgender teachers in our schools is not just a consequence of section 37, but the removal of that section would send a very strong message to teachers to take courage, come out and challenge homophobia within schools. We must ask ourselves why this culture exists in schools. The reason is the religious ethos that pervades our education system, an ethos which views LGBTQ people as somehow disordered and somehow unsafe to be in the company of children. During the marriage equality referendum, one of the Catholic bishops asked whether its schools would seriously be expected to teach students about same-sex relationships. That was the issue for the church. The debate opened up to scrutiny what is happening in schools and showed the chilling effect on teachers. As Deputy Paul Murphy noted, some people have asked what the big deal is given that no one has been sacked under the section 37 provisions. When I looked up statistics for the United States, I found that 11 people came out publicly to say they were sacked for being gay in that country in 2011. Ten of those 11 worked in education. Why is it that teachers, in particular, are being subjected to a different standard from that applied to other workers? That is not acceptable, particularly following a marriage equality referendum in which people in this country made clear their wish to remove discrimination, end the oppression of the past and ensure people are not upset in their personal lives.We have not seen sackings yet, but a person does not need to be sacked. I mentioned the case of the teacher called in for a chat. We have also had someone hiding her face, something the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, commented on at the time. This is not unusual. The Anti-Austerity Alliance held a press conference this morning. I spoke to a number of teachers and asked them if they would speak at it. I know they feel really strongly on the issue, but they were afraid, even after the marriage equality referendum. They were afraid it would somehow jeopardise their relationship with the school and their promotion prospects. It is not just gay and lesbian teachers who face these threats. This is a broader issue. Eileen Flynn is a case some of us are old enough to remember as it was going on. She was a teacher, in a relationship with a separated father of three young children, who became pregnant and was fired from her school. She lost her case because, unfortunately, in Ireland there is an exemption, in reality, which allows discrimination by religious-run institutions. Unfortunately for Eileen Flynn, she was not a union member as well, which did not help. Could that situation happen again? I think it could. There are cases, particularly in rural areas, where the school management has a very conservative ethos. We have seen cases cited in recent times. A school in Sligo queried why it should introduce a child-centred education when a whole number of cases involving sexual abuse allegations were brought up. I do not think it is out of the world that this would pass. In the United States, Catholic schools are an increasing sector in education. A teacher in a Catholic school in California was sacked days after marrying his partner in a civil ceremony. The reason given was that the marriage occurred and the school's position was that it violated church teachings. The school issued a statement saying that it would continue to educate students in the tradition of the Catholic faith and that "[a]s a Benedictine school, St. Lucy's is a community for those who wish to express Christian values and education and develop personal and academic excellence". In other words, people are expected to conform to a narrow view of what the Catholic hierarchy deem to be acceptable. There was also the case in the United States of a teacher who was fired and called an immoral sinner by a Catholic school because she had IVF treatment. She announced at school that she was pregnant and disclosed to someone in good faith, in a personal conversation, that she had IVF treatment. She was subsequently dismissed because it was deemed not to be a good example for students and not to go along with Catholic teaching. Section 37 brings up the historical connection between Church and State in this country. Some 96% of primary schools have denominational patronage and 90% of them are Catholic-owned or run. The situation in secondary schools is not much better. We have schools which are called community schools but there is Catholic patronage in many of those schools as well. This does not reflect a choice among the population. There is a big demand for more diversity. I know this from my own area. Even if it did reflect the wishes of the majority, minority rights also matter. The United Nations and the Council of Europe have raised this issue of education five times with the State. The State funds all schools. It pays the salaries and trains the teachers, but it allows admission policies which are exclusive and it allows exemptions to employment law. We need a separation of church and State in this country. That has become patently clear from the marriage equality referendum and from the wishes of the majority in society. It was young people who led that movement. What does it say about the homophobic and transgender attitudes that must be prevalent in many schools if teachers themselves cannot come out? What message is being sent to students who are gay? Let us not forget the tragic case of Savita Halappanavar. That this is a Catholic country was cited by a health professional. Archbishops are on the board of the National Maternity Hospital. Why? What gynaecological expertise does a bishop have that he would be sitting on a maternity hospital board? We need to separate church and State in order that women receive the care they need and minorities of all kinds are protected. We also have the huge issue of freedom of conscience. People who are not Catholic or religious are being forced to teach religion and to go to schools to which they do not really want to go. I welcome the support for the Bill and I hope it is moved very quickly and not left to gather dust.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	I commend the Anti-Austerity Alliance Deputies on putting forward this legislation. I also commend the Government on announcing it is not opposing the Bill. However, I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to resist the temptation that the Bill sits forever on Committee Stage and ends up dying with this Dáil as it comes to a close. It is a surprising turn by the Government, which has repeatedly stated it could not delete section 37 due to constitutional issues and instead advocated that it should be amended. While this Bill amends section 37, it replaces it with wording which makes it clear that discrimination on any grounds by religious organisations or bodies under the direction or control of a religious organisation is unacceptable. It will be illegal to give less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, membership of the Traveller community, disability or race. In essence, the Bill presents a cultural move away from the notion that public service providers such as schools, hospitals and clinics are institutions which hold special privilege when it comes to applying the principles of equality. We have deemed the marriage institution as incapable of discriminating against LGBT relationships and now it is time to extend that protection to other institutions. The Bill addresses the wider issue of the relationship between the church and the State. The Catholic Church is still patron to almost 90% of Ireland's primary schools. Ireland is essentially experiencing a crisis in education provision, providing only one option for parents, an option which includes an ethos that is not reflective of the multicultural and modern society we see today. I want to focus on the consequences of this section on education and, in particular, on children in the schools that are affected by it. A very important point to make is that while the section discriminates against potential employees or current employees, employees at least have the freedom to move. Children have less mobility, physically and emotionally. They do not have the freedom to question authority, hold it to account or pick and choose where they feel they would be best educated. It is imperative, therefore, that we provide them with the safest, most inclusive environment in the schools they attend. This is only possible if the educational institution's ethos is inclusive and promotes diversity and equality. Currently this is not reflected through the management of our educational system. The parish priest still effectively manages the board of management of national schools. The diocese nominates three members, including the chairperson, to the board of management. There are two teacher representatives on the board. The board is stacked in favour of the ethos because the teachers may not feel they can challenge it if they are to protect their jobs. I am a member of the board of management in my local school in Killybegs. The school has a very inclusive ethos and it works very well. The board of management works on that basis. There have never been any issues or questions about inclusion or anything such as that in the school. At the same time, the legislation is still there in the background and the chilling effect, a phrase I hate, is often talked about. We have to deal with it. If this Bill were passed, it would ensure a more equal environment for prospective employees and current employees. Section 37, as far as I know, has not been challenged and we all know that on the surface schools seem fairly relaxed about imposing the Catholic ethos on employment procedures. However, discrimination can be and often is silent. How many promotions were passed over because an employee did not fit the profile due to his or her sexuality, beliefs or ethnicity? How can we truly know the full consequences of section 37 if discrimination of this kind is protected in legislation? The enactment of this Bill would ensure a more equal environment for children and the students who attend the schools affected by it.Children cannot interview a prospective teacher or sit on a board of management, so they must place their trust in the adults in their surroundings. If those adults practise principles of equality they are certain to benefit from that, as people will be hired to teach based on their ability and not on allegiance to a particular ethos. It would also ensure greater transparency in the hiring process, ensuring that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified LGBT people are not deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State. This was stated in the current Government's programme for Government as one of its commitments. There are a number of contradictions surrounding section 37. The Equal Status Act protects an individual from discrimination on the basis of the grounds as outlined in the wording of this proposed new Bill, but the individual is not protected from discrimination when it comes to certain religious organisations or bodies controlled by them. The original Bill is also in contradiction to the anti-bullying action plan of the Department of Education and Skills, which promotes a transparent, accessible approach to reporting bullying, with the full engagement of the board of management of the school. To add to the contradiction, there are competing rights involved, including freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, the right to privacy and to earn a living, freedom of expression and conscience and the right to freedom from harassment and discrimination. The constitutional obligation on the State to vindicate the personal rights of citizens is also included and has caused division in approaches to the section. I wish to stress that the right to education, something I pursued in my proposed economic, cultural and social rights Bill, is a fundamental right our children deserve. However, they are lost among the competing rights because for some reason we do not see them as citizens. We cannot forget that they are citizens. For as long as the Government outsources its education provision to the Catholic Church, the patronage system will view education as an indoctrination of teachings and of religious ethos. This bears a heavy weight on LGBT children. The legacy of such teachings has chilled the environment enough to halt or restrict the experience of childhood, and its transition into adulthood. This has restricted many teachers too. As the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, has indicated, 90 teachers have emerged as LGBT and it predicts that many more may come out in the wake of the success of the marriage referendum. We cannot resist the fact that in many parts of the country, although not all, there is a growing demand for non-denominational education. Immigration and emigration have contributed to the transformation of our monocultural society. With children coming from many different backgrounds, we must ensure that they are all equal in the eyes of the State, and this can only be done if our education system is equal. I take this opportunity to thank BeLonG To, and especially its director, Michael Barron. The organisation has campaigned on section 37 for the past 12 years and has seen this issue come and go under previous Governments. BeLonG To has also been involved with four other Private Members' Bills that have been brought before the Dáil and Seanad in an attempt to address what we are trying to address in section 37, but to no avail. I welcome the fact that the Government has not declined its support, but I urge it to keep section 37 on the agenda. I also urge the Department of Education and Skills to maintain a strong focus on the implementation of its anti-bullying action plan in schools. Greater resources are required to ensure it is effective in every school in Ireland. Now that the Government has identified areas to tackle homophobic bullying in primary and post-primary schools, it must ensure its application and monitor the success of its take-up. Perhaps the Government would indicate any plans it has to review that implementation and to assess the effectiveness of the plan.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	I also welcome the legislation and thank the Deputies for using Private Members' time for Second Stage. I am pleased that the Minister indicated when he was appointed to office that the reform of section 37 was a priority for him. I acknowledge that he has a legitimate intention in that regard and we all appreciate the fact that this Bill is not being opposed by the Government. However, that does not necessarily mean that the Bill will move forward in the way it should. We must see follow through on it. The Bill naturally follows from the positive result of the referendum on 22 May. We all felt very good about that result. Deputies from all sides of the House will look back on that day with a good deal of fondness. It was a very positive day and a day on which, for a change, many of us felt we were not fighting with each other. Most of us were on the same side. Many of us became involved in politics with the goal of achieving equality for all citizens - equal rights, equality of opportunities and equality of outcome, equal access to services of the State, equal access to health care and education and equal pay for equal work. All of us could write a long list regarding equality. That is the reason section 37 of the Employment Equality Act sticks out like a sore thumb, containing wide ranging and blank cheque language to provide for State sanctioned discrimination. There is no legitimate reason for it and that is acknowledged by many people. During the referendum campaign I knew some teachers who were gay or lesbian but who did not speak publicly. They were concerned for their jobs because of the environment in which they worked. People tend to think this happens in Catholic schools, but that was not entirely the case. It was more than that, and we can perhaps understand that this could be the case. They did not feel they could compromise their job security. Some of them love being teachers and are very good teachers, which should be the main reason that we employ people to teach children in our classrooms. Consider the daily reality of being a teacher in a school where one cannot participate in the discussions in the staff canteen and fears how much of one's personal life to reveal. It is a very personal thing for teachers. While many gay and lesbian teachers teach openly in schools, which is very positive, a long shadow is cast by virtue of the legislation being in place. That is the reason it should be removed. As I said, there was a positive feeling after the referendum not just among the people directly affected by the result but also in the wider community in terms of what it meant. While I am not at all religious, I acknowledge the remarks of people such as Archbishop Diarmuid Martin - I believe we must try to work with such people - who recognised many of the very positive attributes of that day. People felt their community and country accepted them for what they are and that they could live honest lives. I thought that would resonate with part of the ethos on which he would have been commenting. I believe this country has an attitude of live and let live, and that we wish to give maximum freedom for people to live their lives and not have laws where they are inappropriate. Some of the countries in which same-sex marriage has been legalised, such as Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Belgium, Luxembourg, Uruguay and Argentina, are countries with a Catholic majority. In addition, polls in the United States show majority support for same-sex marriage among Catholics. Obviously, a powerful message was sent from this Republic when the citizens made the decision. That has not been lost on anybody and it is obviously the reason it was commented on so widely. However, there are wider issues to be raised, including school patronage and expanding that patronage. School patronage did not start after the foundation of the State. It dates back to the aftermath of Catholic Emancipation, in particular, when schools started to develop usually under a patron. It is a hangover from an out of date time in our history.This is why we need more movement and to give more choice, not only to teachers but also to parents making choices for their children. A wider choice results in options very quickly. The Educate Together schools are a case in point even though religion is taught in them. The need for wider choice is appreciated. It is even appreciated within the religious-run schools themselves.

Deputies will be well aware of my strong convictions on the need to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. I entirely agree with the Deputies proposing the legislation that it is wrong to discriminate or exclude people from employment or to deny them services under the nine grounds of the equality legislation. It is our collective belief across this House and society that one's gender, sexual orientation, civil status, religion, age, disability, ethnicity or membership of the Traveller community should never be used to discriminate or exclude. It is for that very reason that I was one of the proposers of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2013, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad. I proposed it with my colleagues Senator Bacik and Deputies Lyons, Hannigan and Conway. Since my appointment as a Minister of State, I have met union representatives, including the INTO LGBT group, on a number of occasions to discuss this topic with them. I was involved in the launch of the “Teachers for Yes” campaign earlier this year in addition to speaking at the INTO LGBT group’s annual conference. I have heard at first hand the group’s stories about teachers who are afraid to be themselves in their workplace. This is not acceptable. These are the people who train our young people, teach them how to read and write and give so much to our society. Divorcees, cohabiting couples and unmarried parents experience the same chill factor. They all deserve to have the right to be themselves in their place of work. The existing section 37(1) of Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that a religious, educational or medical institution that is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment that promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person if it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or prospective employee where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or it takes action that is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. The provision was previously contained in the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held that Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance that better meets the rights of employees, the Supreme Court decision outlines the need for balance to be struck; it is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. While the provision was found in 1997 to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of employees, on the one hand, and freedom of religion, on the other, there is legitimate concern that, in practice, it has not worked. Primarily, its operation is regarded as having a particularly chilling effect on LGBT people in the educational system; however, it also affects lone parents and divorcees who are restricted in discussing their private lives with their colleagues in the safety of their staff room. It should be noted that many countries provide for an equivalent of section 37 in their statute book. The main difference is that most countries do not have the vast majority of their schools and hospitals under religious patronage. During my numerous meeting with the INTO LGBT group, I have heard stories of teachers who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender experiencing feelings of isolation and disempowerment in their work. They feel constrained in what they can disclose about their personal lives to their colleagues fearing that this will affect their career or even their daily experience of work in the school. Some even fear the prejudices of parents and students. I have always believed that it is a sad reflection of our equality law that it could be used to make people feel so unequal. For this reason, the Government, in the programme for Government, committed to amending section 37(1) to ensure that its operation leads to a fairer and more equitable balance between the rights of freedom of religion or association, on the one hand, and the right of persons in employment or prospective employees to be free from discrimination and to privacy in their personal lives, on the other. The Government is committed to advancing equality for LGBT people. During our term of office we have introduced the Children and Family Relationships Bill, recognising the different types of families that exist in our State. We held a marriage equality referendum, which both Government parties supported, to ensure that LGBT citizens can get married. We introduced the Gender Recognition Bill to allow people to identify in their chosen gender. We are tackling homophobic bullying in schools. Section 37 is the next step on this journey. On 23 May, there was a collective celebration of joy among LGBT people and their allies as we watched this country enshrine tolerance and love into our Constitution. I was so proud to stand with my LGBT friends and cheer with them as we watched the passage by our people of full marriage equality into our law. I was so proud to be Irish that day as we became the first country in the world to grant full marriage equality by means of a public vote. However, it saddened me that some of the people with whom I was celebrating had to go to work the following Monday and pretend nothing had happened. They could not mention that they had celebrated, nor could they mention the benefit the change in law would have for them. This is why, in one of my first public statements after the referendum, I made clear my intention to continue with the work I started in 2013 and ensure that this section of our law would be amended as soon as possible. One of the stories that has stuck with me since I began my work on this matter concerns the meeting this year between the INTO LGBT group and our President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, at Áras an Uachtaráin. This was to be a day of great celebration and recognition of many years of campaigning work. As the group assembled, its members walked with pride and joy up to the main entrance of the residence. They stood and walked together but, unfortunately, some of them became nervous when a group photograph was suggested. Deeply uncomfortable, at least half a dozen of these teachers stepped to the side, afraid of any consequences that being photographed would have for their career. We live in a republic and, quite simply, this should not happen. The approach of tonight's Bill is somewhat different from that taken in the 2013 Private Members’ Bill in that it proposes removing the right of religious-run educational and medical institutions to take action against an employee who is undermining the institution's ethos. However, I believe the spirit of what we are trying to achieve is much the same, which is why the Government will not be opposing the Bill before us. I have a fear that in tonight's Bill there is a conflict with the constitutional protection for freedom of religion and of religious groups to establish their own institutions of the type at issue here. It is also unclear as to how it would provide any guidance on how to resolve disputes between employees and employers. It would remain the case that an employer has the right to take the action against employees who act against the employer's best interests, and disputes would, following the deletion of the existing provision, fall to be resolved under generally applicable labour relations law. The best course of action is to progress with the 2013 Private Members’ Bill as it insists that employers that are religious institutions providing publicly funded services would have to meet a high standard of justification for any action taken against an employee on grounds of undermining the institution's ethos. This Bill does not distinguish between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes compared with those providing a social, educational or medical service to the public financed by State funding. This is an important distinction that must be provided for in any amending legislation to ensure its constitutionality. The Government has already accepted the principle of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, currently before the Seanad, to amend section 37(1). It will be tabling a number of amendments of its own to improve the Private Members’ Bill when Committee Stage resumes later in the Seanad. The drafting of these amendments is being finalised at present and will be announced as soon as they are received from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and approved by the Government. The intention thereafter is to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible, hopefully by September. The test the Oireachtas must meet when legislating on this matter is to do as the Supreme Court instructed and maintain a proportionate balance between the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and the rights of citizens to have full equality before the law and to earn their livelihood. The intentions of the Bill before us are commendable, but we all need to bear in mind very clearly that there is no room for error and that any attempt at reform could be struck down by the courts in the future.This could have a serious adverse impact on precisely the people we are trying to protect. Given the delicate competing rights involved here, it is vital that we carefully consider our approach to reform with the advice of the Attorney General to ensure that it is constitutionally robust and immune from future successful challenge. I can guarantee to everyone in this House that it would be challenged. For that reason, while the Government is not opposing this Bill, we consider that it is better to continue as we are doing which is to advance reform of section 37(1) through amendments to the already mentioned Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that is currently before the Seanad. I hope that the Deputies can understand my reasons for this approach, which are not against the good intentions of the Bill, and accept that the Government is as anxious as any to see this matter addressed as quickly as possible in a way that is constitutionally compliant. So much of my work as Minister of State with responsibility for new communities, culture, equality and drugs strategy is based around the dignity employment brings to an individual or a community. A job brings financial security but it brings a sense of purpose and self-esteem. Traveller groups point to the high level of unemployment in their community as a key issue to be addressed. The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities which I am currently working on will help those with disabilities into the workplace and protect those workers who acquire a disability. Gender equality in the workplace and introducing progressive family leave legislation is a key commitment for this year. Work is central to our identity as citizens. It is a place where we can grow and contribute. It is where we must be able to be ourselves. There can be no chill factor, which is why we will amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus gabhaim buíochas, mar aon le Teachtaí eile, leis na páirtithe sóisialta, go mór mór an Teachta Dála Seosamh Ó hUiginn. In welcoming the Bill and acknowledging that we are almost unanimous in this House in acknowledging that we need to change section 37, I am reminded of an incident in my younger days as a young teacher knowing that I was gay and being genuinely afraid because of the ethos of the school and the environment that existed. I wondered whether we would ever come to a day where teachers of any description would be free to be who they are. Thankfully, we are moving to that moment in time in our separation of Church and State where all citizens will be free to be who they are. I pay tribute to the Minister of State for the work he has done since becoming Minister of State and before that because he has been very much to the fore with regard to that legislation. It is important that we acknowledge anecdotally that there are people in our schools who have been refused promotion, be it to the post of year head, another post of responsibility, principal or vice principal. I know them. There are people today who are afraid to come out and who, as the Minister of State alluded to, did not participate in the referendum and went back to school on Monday morning to a workforce that was in its own way delighted with the result. Those people did not have the ability to be free to join that celebration. Surely we are at a point where to deny somebody promotional opportunities because of their sexual orientation, which is deemed to be contrary to the ethos of the school, is no longer tenable. That exists in our schools today. I challenge those who oppose what we are trying to achieve in this House to speak to people who have had that position thrust upon them. Equally, some people from the LGBT community who are substituting or moving from school to school are afraid to reveal who they are because it might hinder their prospects of getting a job in a school. As we heard in another fine contribution, this leads to members of the teaching profession being isolated, promotes invisibility and exclusion and above all, adds to the mental health difficulties and distress of individuals within the gay community. This is wrong and should never be allowed to continue at a time when we have a very strong anti-bullying regime in our schools, which again is to the credit of this Government. I pay tribute to the former Minister for Education and Skills for the work he did in this regard. To many people outside our education system, section 37 may mean nothing but it casts a huge dark cloud over many within our education system. It is that chill factor that I and many of my colleagues felt where we had to hide who we were for a variety of reasons, one of which was this. I taught religion in a secondary school. One can imagine what would have happened had I ever dared to show certain characteristics, which I did at times to my cost. It is difficult to come in here and speak about that because so many of my colleagues did not come out in school and were refused promotional opportunities because of their sexual orientation. That is wrong, which is why this debate is about ensuring that regardless of whether it is in our education system or health care setting, religious freedom is allowed and protected but at the same time, those of us who are gay are allowed to be up-front about who we are and our personal lives. I am often struck by the many wonderful people in our education system who go into school every day, teach and prepare children to be the best they can be. Those of us who have worked in staff rooms know that the staff room is perhaps the most political place one could ever be where people talk about their weekends and their partners and ask you what you did and where you went. You say "I went here and I went there." They ask you "who did you go with?" and you answer "oh, with a gang." Thankfully, we are changing that part of the lexicon of our staff rooms. Teachers can tell their stories about their weekends or holidays with their partners. However, because section 37 stands, it still precludes people from doing that. On a Monday morning over coffee or at lunch time, some people must pick and choose where they sit or the conversation they can have. This is not right. It is not just people from the LGBT community who are affected. In theory, this hovers over people with a different religious perspective, ethos and belief from that of a religious body that operates within the workplace. Our society prevents discrimination and has many strong legal protections in place to protect against unequal treatment because of sexual orientation and religious belief. In celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the Unfair Dismissals Act, it is time that we ensure that a person cannot be fired or even deprived of promotion because of their sexual orientation. The Employment Equality Act was passed 17 years ago this month adding to the protections on the grounds of sexual orientation. We can and will build on these transformative pieces of legislation. We can make them fairer and better. In his speech, the Minister of State spoke about 23 May 2015. It was probably one of the greatest days we will ever have. It was better than Cork winning the double. It was better than Cork ever beating Kerry. That is how I can describe the euphoria from a Cork man's perspective. Deputy Higgins will understand what I am saying, as will the Minister of State who is a sporting man as well. That day signified that we had moved as a nation in the eyes of the world but equally among ourselves. It was not about liberal or conservative, Catholic or non-Catholic or left versus right. It was the country coming together to say we had moved to a different place. What we are saying in this Bill and the Bill the Minister of State will bring forward is that people from the LGBT community should be treated in the same way as their heterosexual friends and colleagues in the workplace. Even though our people voted overwhelmingly for marriage equality and showed we are an open, progressive society, we also showed that we accept and recognise difference and that we want all of us to be treated equally. When it comes to employment, we continue to have this provision that does provide for discrimination even though I presume it will never be used. It still hovers over us, particularly within the education system. We must be consistent in our approach to discrimination. We cannot accept legislative provisions that potentially facilitate discrimination based on sexual orientation. That inconsistency needs to be addressed. I am confident that the programme for Government commitment will deliver on this and we will see an amendment to section 37. The programme for Government is clear on that. The Minister and Minister for State are quite clear on that.We will remove this barrier.  I welcome the Minister of State's speech and the work he has done on this issue to date. It is important that we do not divide the House. We must send a unified message on this because we are basically saying the same thing and we should try to reach the end game together. That is why it is important that we all remain sound on this issue, which is about men and women. I wish to pay tribute to the INTO's LGBT group and its chairman, Ann Marie Lillis, for the work it has been doing. That group demonstrated, long before it was popular or acceptable, and served as the voice for the LGBT community within our education system, along with the ASTI and the TUI. We are near completion on this. I understand the difficulties that the Minister of State spoke about earlier. It would be wrong of us to get to the final furlong in this race only to trip up. We need to take this to the final game successfully. As the Minister of State said, there is no room for error on this.  I welcome this debate. Given the progress already made on gender recognition and marriage equality, it is clear that this Government has done a huge amount of work in terms of equality for those of us who are gay. I will finish by quoting Harvey Milk, the famous and great campaigner who said, "It takes no compromise to give people their rights ... it takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no political deal to give people freedom. It takes no survey to remove repression". Hopefully, when it comes to equality and people who are gay, this Government will not be found wanting.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and thank the Socialist Party for putting it forward. It is timely that we should debate it now, in the aftermath of the historic and overwhelming endorsement by the people of marriage equality in the recent referendum. When one looks at the wording of this, one cannot help but be struck by how we are still grappling with historical legacies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when this State and its institutions were being put in place. The system of educational provision was outsourced. There was such distrust in the institutions of the State that it was required that our health and education systems would be run by religious institutions. That is not in any way to cast aspersions on the religious because no-one else was providing health care or education at that time. They were stepping in to fill the gap and to provide a service that was vital. It is instructive to look at the wording of the 1937 Constitution, which was written under the close eye of the Catholic hierarchy at the time. It says that the State "shall provide for free primary education". It does not say that the State shall provide it but that it shall provide "for" it. That key word, "for", changes the entire constitutional dynamic by which we can interfere in, govern or legislate for our education system. It essentially says that the State provides the architecture but must allow for others to provide the service. That is a huge distinction and it was designed to protect and promote a system of religious education which is at the core of our Constitution. It means that when we talk about what schools and religious authorities can demand from those who work for them, we are constrained by very significant constitutional provisions and legal architecture which cannot simply be dismissed. If I were to go back in time and have a say in the way the education system operates, I would not be happy with our model. Neither would I be happy with the compromise model as suggested by the forum on pluralism and patronage, which is to divest schools and create Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, non-denominational schools and so forth. I do not think that works. It is segregation; it creates differences based on beliefs and puts people into boxes or separate institutions. If I had my way, I would follow the German model, having worked there as a teacher for a year. In Germany, instruction for all religions takes place within the school. One of the classes is religion and for that period, students are segregated but they come back together again for English, mathematics and so forth. That is a much better approach but unfortunately, unless there is a very serious redesign of our Constitution, we will not be able to do that. Four years after starting the divestment process, very limited progress has happened which suggests that trying to do anything more radical will not be possible in the short term. The nub of this issue is tolerance versus acceptance, "equal but we're better" and the "don't ask and don't tell" mentality. The message is, "Yes, okay, but shut up". That is not equality or acceptance. It is not giving people the pride and dignity of their own self worth and their own humanity or assuring them that, in the eyes of everyone, they are equal and deserving of respect for who they are. That is the crux of the matter.  The efforts being made here by both Bills to change this situation would probably be approved of by a majority similar to that which passed the marriage equality referendum. However, we are still dealing here with an entrenched position on the part of Catholic schools and, indeed, other denominational schools. There will be entrenched opposition to this, which is why we should err on the side of constitutionality and work within what we know are the confines of the Constitution. That is the better way to proceed. I understand that some sections of the Bill as proposed are deemed to have the potential to conflict with the current constitutional architecture whereas the Bill that was put forward by the Minister of State and Senator Bacik, the Employment Equality Bill 2013, takes a more nuanced view and fits within the confines of the Constitution. Either way, the efforts by the Socialist Party, the fact that this issue is on the agenda, is being debated and that the Minister of State has given such a welcome commitment are all things to be positive about. I hope we can have the legislation enacted as soon as possible.

We would not be where we are today but for his insistence that there be a referendum on marriage equality. I imagine that when he insisted on this, many people felt that there was no guarantee that it would go through. It is a sign of his far-sightedness that the threshold could be crossed. As someone who lived through the divorce referendum and who saw how that barely passed 20 years ago, I had a nervousness that the referendum would not carry or would only barely carry. I thought there would be a slippage into the "No" camp towards the end of the campaign. I thought the referendum would carry but I thought it would do so by a smaller majority. My apprehension was based on the experience of the divorce referendum, which barely scraped through. We live in a changed world. To give a personal twist on this issue, when I was in my twenties I did the graduate teaching course in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra. On a number of occasions I had a dispute with the lecturer in religion about whether people should be obliged to teach denominational religion if they did not have the religious faith concerned. It was most interesting that while nearly all of my classmates agreed with what I was arguing, none of them would speak. It was possible for me to speak because I happened to be part of a minority.I knew I would not be looking for a job in a Catholic school so I did not feel any nervousness in arguing that viewpoint. I believe we are in a changed place. I cannot envisage that being the case now. I know the Minister of State present will recognise this. We can be very proud that irrespective of the denominational connection of most of our schools, from my knowledge and experience the practice is that schools are places of tolerance and inclusion, and every effort is made by the staff of schools to be inclusive and to encourage tolerance. It is because of that we are in a good place. I agree with the remarks of the previous speaker, Deputy Nolan, on the teaching of religion. The German model is quite a good model if we could start from scratch. We have the great advantage of tradition and a determination on the part of schools to ensure that people are accepted and treated with respect. In view of that I am optimistic that the path forward on this legislation will be positive and beneficial for the country.

As a republican party, we are committed to seeing discrimination particularly in our public services come to an end. Over the course of this Dáil, similar legislation proposed in the Seanad in 2012 was rejected by the Government. I welcome that the Minister of State has expressed support for the spirit of the legislation. The current exemption clause in the legislation is quite odious and essentially allows an employer to apply discrimination. Section 37(1) of the Act provides for exemptions for religious orders for the purpose of discrimination. The House widely agrees that section should be removed or replaced in that it is not representative of the spirit of society and the recent success of the legislation. The proposed legislation would introduce a new section 37(1). We welcome the idea of having favourable treatment and eliminating the clause of actively discriminating based on the grounds set out in the equality legislation. There is a significant challenge. GLEN and the teachers' unions that have been involved in the campaign to date have made an incredible effort to get to this juncture. I acknowledge the dedication, commitment and above all the actions of everybody in the House who is prepared to vote for the Bill. I also acknowledge the trade union organisation and GLEN for their civic leadership in this respect. Freedom of religion is an important constitutional value and one that we, as a party, respect. However, religion should not be used as an opportunity to permit discrimination, particularly when it comes to employment. It is unacceptable that the current legislation would target a small minority of people to be effectively discriminated against. Irrespective of the workplace, surely the ethos of the workplace should be about acknowledging people's differences and providing an opportunity to work with respect and in a harmonious environment. I appreciate that there are concerns over the constitutional aspect of it. The test of the Oireachtas when it faces such legislation is to preserve the balance between the right of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs and maintain its own institutions for religious purposes, and the rights of citizens to have equality under the law. I welcome the Bill, which will have our support. I acknowledge the commitment of the Minister of State in this respect to ensure everybody on that side of the House will wholeheartedly support the legislation when the decision comes to the House in the next 24 hours. Well done.

I welcome that the Government has indicated support for it. Like previous speakers, I appeal that it should not languish, awaiting Committee Stage. The Government has supported many Bills to proceed to Committee Stage, but they go to Room 101 and make no progress. This Bill is too important to go to Room 101. I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which sets out to amend the Employment Equality Act to ensure it cannot be used to discriminate against lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers on the grounds of a school's religious ethos. This has been an issue which has been widely debated, not least among those in our education sector and activists in the LGBT community. At the end of 2013, I remember reading the thorough submission made by GLEN to the Equality Authority on this issue. In preparing for this debate I revisited that submission. It is striking that there is need for such a submission in 2015. This section should have been amended years ago. At a time when Ireland has attracted global attention as a champion of LGBT equality, the Bill is another important stepping-stone in ensuring that Irish society is truly rid of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We have, as a nation, voted with an overwhelming 62% to 38% majority, with just one constituency voting "No". It was a tremendous moment in our history, making us the first country in the world to vote for marriage equality. Collectively it was a great achievement for our people. Yet, in the classroom and workplace, outdated provisions such as section 37 mean that our LGBT teachers are still afraid that their sexual orientation will result in them being treated like second-class citizens. My party firmly believes that discrimination and intolerance should be challenged and stamped out wherever it exists. The old days of loopholes and shelters for any type of ignorance should be put behind us. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers have the right to have their private lives respected and we must repeal archaic loopholes that allow discrimination in the name of ethos as quickly as possible. We all believe teachers should be judged, employed and treated on the basis of their teaching ability alone. The ending of this legalised discrimination is about more than teachers, as was alluded to by a number of speakers. The weight of laws such as section 37 impresses upon gay, lesbian and transgender people the type of self-censorship which enables and propagates homophobia in general. Schools are where children form their identities, and learn and develop as individuals. It is paramount that our legislation and legal protections have tolerance, diversity and equality within them. The treatment of lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers can have a major bearing on how young gay people see themselves. Teachers are role models for schoolchildren and this is no less true of gay teachers. Young people coming to terms with their sexuality should feel comfortable in having gay role models as teachers. When young gay people see that their role models are being discriminated against, or even verbally bullied, they will be less confident and less comfortable in asserting their individual rights. Clearly it is incumbent on the Government to address section 37, a clause that has reinforced fears of discrimination against LGBT workers in religious-run institutions, particularly those employed in schools and hospitals.Its retention on the Statute Book makes it even more difficult for employees to be open about their sexuality. This is reflected in research published jointly in 2007 by the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, which found the fear associated with section 37(1) has a significant, negative impact on lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers. The inclusion of this provision effectively forces teachers to avoid seeking employment in given sectors or to take up employment in conditions where they are compelled to conceal their sexuality. Removal of this provision will help to create a culture in schools in which homophobic bullying of teachers and students is no longer tolerated. If we are serious about combating homophobic bullying then we need to address section 37 and ensure no loophole remains in existing legislation that will allow discrimination in any shape or form. This is the society for which Ireland voted on 22 May. It is the Ireland that all of us in this House have a duty to reflect in the legislation we enact.
 Debate adjourned.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	The year 2018 is too far away in the context of the introduction of this levy. There is also scope to include properties outside of those zoned residential as developers sitting on commercial property is also not in the interests of communities and the economy. The exclusion of all properties in negative equity, particularly larger properties or ones in areas of high housing demand, is also a problem. If the property is of low market value then the levy rate may not work but some form of charge should be in place in areas where there is a need for housing. Developers would be better off using this land and potentially increasing its value. Currently, they do not have to do anything on these lands, which in many cases they bought for speculative purposes. The owner may have lost out on a gamble but he or she should not be given a get-out clause in terms of his or her social responsibility. Some may say this is unfair but what is really unfair is the family without a home while speculative developers leave land idle in the hope of a return to the days of high sale prices. At a time when people are living in hotel rooms and hostels because of a lack of housing and ever increasing rents we cannot allow this to continue. Properties that have no market value are also excluded, the reason for which may be that the land is not safe or suitable for development. If this is not the case, these properties if left idle should be also subject to some form of a levy. Market demand for a site is not important when there is a social demand for it in respect of housing need. This is paramount. The public must come before the market. Provision should be made for councils to take in charge or buy lands that could be developed but remain idle following the introduction of this levy. There should be an increase in the annual levy in respect of properties which remain idle. This will further encourage development or force speculators to sell land to people interested in making use of it. Grounds for appeal should be strict given the notice to be provided in respect of which developers must use land or prove it is already in use. On failure of an appeal the site levy should be applied retrospectively. Appeals should not be used to hold off as long as possible the payment of levies which are justified. Following closure of the initial appeals window any further appeal should not lead to a freezing or suspension of the levy for any period until the appeal has been concluded. The Government proposes to take water charges payments from the social welfare benefits of those who refuse to pay. I believe such a move would be more appropriate in the case of a developer who refuses to pay the levy. Prolonged failure to pay the levy in an area of high need should lead to councils taking a property in charge. The levy should also not apply in respect of any planned development but on the basis of actual work being carried out, which work has been approved by the board as legitimate development on the site in question for the purposes of housing provision. Erection of a shed or the breaking of ground to no end should not justify an end to the levy in respect of a site. On removal from the register, a probationary period within which a site can be returned to the register should apply, with the levy being retrospectively applied if satisfactory development has not been followed through. Proceeds from the levy must be ring-fenced for the provision of housing, as well as covering the costs of administration of the levy. While the levy could be used to provide housing on a vacant site it must not be tied to that site and should be available for the provision of housing in areas where the council sees fit. The levy should not be used to improve the properties of inactive developers at no further expense to them. Sinn Féin cannot support this Bill in the context of the proposed changes to Part V, which will reduce it to a mechanism to provide social leasing and provide more get-out clauses for developers. We will seek to amend this Bill substantially on Committee Stage, by seeking changes to the vacant site levy and a strengthening of the approach to Part V to ensure delivery of the maximum number of council houses by private developers.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	There is no doubt but that social housing in Ireland has improved over the decades. It is self-evident that the quality of houses now being built by the local authorities has improved immeasurably in comparison with those constructed over 30 or 40 years ago. This step-change was needed. However, we are a long way from what all of us would like to see, namely, as in the case of access to health and education, that access to housing would be a right rather than a privilege accessible only to the wealthy or a privilege to be granted or withheld by any national or local government. It should be a fundamental right that people have access to comfortable, safe, secure homes at the point at which they need them. We are currently faced with a housing crisis in Ireland. For a while, we were all blinded by the dejection which homeless people were experiencing and, quite rightly, we had to react to that by way of emergency measure. We cannot have people lying and dying on our streets because they are unable to access a home when they need it. Homelessness was an emergency that had to be tackled and steps were taken to tackle it. Beyond homelessness, there are tens of thousands of people who are at their wits' end trying to pay for their homes or to find homes they can afford. In many cases, people are living in overcrowded conditions. Many have moved in with families, friends and neighbours while trying to find accommodation that they can afford and, in particular, accommodation that they can afford based on their rent supplement. Because of a lack of funding, housing waiting lists are ever growing and so putting one's name on the housing list does no good. Many private landlords are reluctant to take on tenants who are recipients of rent supplement allowance. Some landlords actually refuse to take them on. Those who do so, force those tenants to tell lies. Tenants are also being forced to top-up rent supplement to meet the level of rents that landlords are demanding, information which is not being recorded on social welfare forms. Many tenants are unwillingly giving wrong information. Local authorities know this, as do community welfare officers.Local authorities and community welfare officers also know that if these people want a home, this is what they must do. They must continue this dance of pretence in regard to the rent supplement. It is a fallacy that the cost of renting is reducing. The problem is that we as a nation are not providing enough houses to accommodate all those who need homes. In some counties, like that in which I live, houses lie vacant because there is no demand for them. This happened because developers thought they could make a quick buck. Having brought this nation to the brink of ruin through greed, property speculators are now setting their sights on zoned land, until an opportunity for even greater profits presents itself again. In the meantime, people are being bled dry for private rental accommodation they can barely afford. The holding of vacant land by property speculators is not just bad for the economy but, at a time when there is a dire need for housing, is immoral. I welcome that the Bill will seek to put pressure on owners of vacant land zoned for housing. However, the legislation should go further to ensure vacant plots become homes for families who need homes. The levy could be much stronger, especially in areas where there is a dire need for housing. The levy should also be increased incrementally each year if a plot remains vacant. It should be high enough that developers are encouraged to build rather than hold on to vacant sites. This measure is not recommended to punish those who build houses, but to punish those who are speculating on empty sites and hedging their bets in the hope the value of these sites will increase in the future. Like Deputy Ellis, I disagree with the new Part V the Bill seeks to introduce. The original Part V provision provided that in any development of five homes or more, 10% of the development had to be made available for social housing and 10% for affordable housing. This well-intentioned provision was welcome. However, a significant clause within the legislation led to the abuse of that provision. Developers could buy off the council and pay it rather than providing houses. This meant that new developments lacked the number of social housing units needed to develop mixed communities, which led to the further ghettoisation of social housing. The scheme for affordable housing ended in 2012. The new Part V proposal in this legislation provides for a 10% social housing provision, but this includes social leasing. Social leasing involves the council leasing houses from the developer, but the homes remain in the ownership of the developer. This is like the residential accommodation scheme, which I have described as the residential accommodation scam. Instead of a 10% provision, Sinn Féin would like to see a 20% commitment on social housing. Social leasing should remain a possibility, but it should not be included in Part V and should not involve a trade-off. We need a root and branch review of all the legislation governing housing needed for homes for individuals and families. This review should incorporate private rental accommodation, local authority and voluntary organisation housing. It must incorporate minimum standards of accommodation in every sphere of the market. As I speak, I am aware of a young woman, her mother and some of her siblings who are occupying Sligo County Council offices because she has had to leave her private rented house because it is unsafe. Neither the tenant, her family, the council nor I have yet been able to locate a private rental house in the area that will accept a rent supplement tenant. I have tried hard to find accommodation for her, as have others. How and why are landlords permitted to put a house on the rental market and obtain State funding, by way of rent supplement when their houses are unfit and dangerous for occupation? Who checks these houses and the standard of the accommodation before they are rented out? Who checks this accommodation before public money goes into it? Who checks accommodation before families and individuals are put into dangerous and unsafe housing? How many more are there like this young lady?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	This Bill is another example of the Government bringing forward legislation to deal with an issue it has by and large ignored and neglected over the past four years. It has made a big play out of addressing the issue of social housing and the lack of housing in general since the beginning of the year, while well aware that little practical provision will be made in terms of housing provision prior to the next general election. It is clear from the figures we have seen that only a tiny percentage of those on the waiting list will benefit from new local authority housing before the Government's term of office ends. In regard to the four-year programme, the number of households waiting to be housed in Laois stands at 1,800, while the figure for Kildare is heading towards 8,000. Under the new housing programme announced, only 49 housing units will be provided in Laois over the three years. This will not even make a small dent in the housing waiting list, with new people joining the waiting list daily. A whole section of the population in Laois and south Kildare earn just over €25,000 gross and any legislation that does not deal with this issue is flawed. These people earn just over €25,000 gross, with an add-on of €500 per child or dependant allowed. However, those who earn between €25,000 and €27,000 are out of the loop for social housing and are disqualified from applying for a Clúid or Respond house or a Laois or Kildare County Council house. These people are not earning as much as €45,000 or €50,000. Generally, they would need to earn that gross amount to have any hope of ever being able to get a local authority loan, never mind a loan from a bank or building society. We go from one extreme to the other in this country. In the boom time, I used to get two or three letters a week inviting me to come in to the bank as it had a loan available for me. Now we cannot beat money out of the financial institutions. The Minister of State has often mentioned the squeezed middle. These are the people who are earning just above €25,000, which disqualifies them from social housing, and those who are earning below €45,000. These people are caught and will be renting until kingdom come, but unfortunately for them, there is no control over rents. The Government has failed to introduce rent controls and has failed to deal with the rental sector thus far. These people, many of whom have young families and children, are caught in an awful predicament. I know many people throughout counties Laois and Kildare who are caught in this predicament. Several points need to be made about this Bill. Just four years or so ago, the Government parties were very critical of Fianna Fáil for cutting the minimum wage. Why in the name of God has the Government now cut the social housing provision under Part V to 10%? It has halved what it was under the previous Government. Who lobbied for this? Did Tom Parlon and the Construction Industry Federation lobby for that change or was it IBEC? Who lobbied for it? The 20% provision was working quite well.It was 18% in County Laois. That was composed of 9% rented housing and 9% affordable housing, which was a very good scheme. Some discretion was available to local authorities to vary the percentage down if they wished, which worked very well. I wish to highlight another issue relating to Part V which does not concern the Bill. Part V housing provision must be dispersed throughout a housing estate. The Fairgreen housing estate in Portlaoise has approximately 450 units. Another estate is The Bellingham, called after a British terrorist, Lord Bellingham. That will tell one the type of developer who built the estate. In those two housing estates the developer got away with lumping all of the social housing into one corner. In the case of The Bellingham, the houses were built face to face with just a footpath, not a roadway, between the houses. It is appalling and an example of very bad planning. Social housing legislation must ensure housing is dispersed or peppered, as is the more usual term, throughout the estate. In the estate in which I live, Cloonlusk Abbey, my neighbours are council tenants. One cannot tell the difference between the social housing and private houses in the estate. Many of those who live in the estate do not even realise the four neighbours to my left are council tenants. They are very good tenants and we are very lucky to have them in the estate. They look after their houses very well. It shows that social housing works when it is properly dispersed in a housing estate. I question the proposal in section 15 that the levy of 3% on vacant sites will not come into force until 2019. What is it about 2019? We face the problem currently. Developers and banks are sitting on sites since the collapse in property values, which is causing a huge impediment to the construction of houses. These sites are an eyesore and the cause of problems for people who live in those neighbourhoods. I drafted and published a Derelict Sites (Amendment) Bill that sought to address the problem of developers and banks sitting on abandoned sites. There are 123 such sites in County Laois alone. They are a particular problem in Mountrath, Rathdowney and Ballinakill where in some of those towns a number of such sites are grouped together. Tackling the issue by imposing meaningful penalties on those who are deliberately sitting on such sites would contribute greatly to freeing up land for housing in addition to tidying up towns and villages and helping the tidy towns committees that look after them. Some banks and financial institutions do not register the sites in their names because they do not wish to pay the derelict sites levy. They are trying to hide and leave the question of the site ownership cloudy so that local authorities cannot go after them. I also question the provision to enable developers to avail of lower development contributions on planning permissions that have yet to be activated and where houses have yet to be sold. If houses were built and planning permissions included a provision that development levies would be paid - in most cases they were modest – they should be paid. To do otherwise would constitute a write-down for the developers, bankers and financial institutions that own many such properties. Section 31, in effect, does away with the need to provide affordable housing. Affordable housing was one of the great successes of housing policy in the past decade or so. Affordable housing is needed as the cost of housing is increasing and it must be provided for in the Bill. In order to have proper social integration one must have a mix of social, affordable and private housing in the one estate. There are great examples of where such a mix works, where it has been done properly. Affordable housing must be revisited. Otherwise, people will be priced out of the market again. Affordable housing acted as a great leveller and ensured prices did not become excessively high in some areas. It is regrettable that such a measure has been left out of the Bill and I urge the Minister of State to revisit the issue. I welcome some aspects of the Bill, including the provision in section 33 to remove the provision by which developers could make a cash payment or provide sites elsewhere rather than provide the required number of social housing units. However, I do not welcome the Part V provision in section 33 that can be met through social leasing. Where in the name of God is the Minister of State going with such an approach? Previous speakers outlined the problems involved in renting and leasing. The Bill allows developers to provide a long-term lease on a property in order for it to be leased to local authorities for a defined period. At the end of the ten, 15 or 20 years the local authority would not have anything to show for the expenditure. It would not have a house and the people living there would not have a home. They would have to move on somewhere else or the local authority would have to start the process again. If a house were owned by a local authority, the local authority would get rent and it could sell the house under a tenant purchase scheme, if it so wished in order to get another pot of money, but most importantly, a family would get a permanent home. Leasing is madness. It is like what the Tories are doing in London. I do not know from where the Minister of State got the idea. Perhaps it was from the Construction Industry Federation, IBEC or the Tories, but for God’s sake he should return to the drawing board and delete the leasing option from the Bill. That is the most reprehensible part of the Bill and I could not support it for that reason. I regret that the Minister of State has missed the opportunity to tighten up the legislation on social housing, in particular the measures relating to social and affordable housing, an area that badly needs to be addressed. I look forward to the Bill being improved but we could not support it in its current form.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	I do not know where to start given the mess we are in. Unless we grasp how bad the situation is, we cannot even judge the legislation in any meaningful way. We must grasp the scale of the problem we face and the absolute certainty that if things remain the same, the situation will be much worse next year and in the coming years. Nothing in the legislation or in what the Government has announced in the past year, since it finally admitted there is a crisis, will address the fact that the situation will be worse in a year's time and even worse still in four or five years’ time. That seems difficult to imagine when one considers how bad the situation is now, even with all the Government’s trumpeting of the great plans, proposals and new legislation in the past year or so. I do not know where to start, but let me outline a few facts which bear out what I have said. There are 96,000 people on the housing list. In 2008 a total of 4,900 council houses were built. In 2013 the total number of council houses built was 293. The year 2008 was a disaster in terms of social housing. The lists were getting longer and had been getting longer in the years prior to 2008. Even when we had a boom in the construction industry and record levels of private sector construction, the housing lists were getting longer and longer. That puts to bed the utterly insane notion behind this Bill, namely, that if we stimulate, induce, cajole or bribe the private developers to build again, that it will solve the problem. It will not. How do we know that? We know that because it did not solve the problem during the greatest private sector construction boom in the history of the State. The housing crisis got worse during that time.Prices increased, rents increased, housing lists got longer and the number of homeless people increased. The legislation is built on a fundamentally misguided notion that stimulating the private sector will solve the problem. Sorry, it will not even begin to. The Government is asking people who built houses to make profits to provide housing for people who do not have enough money to make profits for private landlords or developers. This is the point of social and affordable housing. They do not have the money to make someone in the private sector rich. They need subsidised housing, given that their income is not sufficient to make some landlord or developer a profit. If the Minister of State is asking the same landlords and developers to deal with a crisis in which hundreds of thousands of families do not have enough income to put a roof over their heads by buying it or by paying inflated private sector rents which have gone through the stratosphere, he is deluding himself. It is absolute and utter nonsense. I slightly disagree with Deputy Stanley's argument that the Part V affordable and social housing scheme worked for us. It did not work. The affordable housing scheme was a disaster. Given that people who bought so-called affordable housing ended up in negative equity after the crash, it turned out not to be affordable at all. It was a massive albatross around their necks. The Part V scheme did not deliver anything like enough housing to make any impact on lists that continued to grow longer. It was estimated that we needed 18,000 housing units per year between 2011 and 2021. Given that we are already four years behind on this target, we need approximately 30,000 units per year to make any impact on an absolute disaster. In Dublin, 8,000 houses have been needed per year since 2011, whereas only 1,360 were delivered in 2013. Figures that came out this week showed that 10,000 extra people per month are entering the private rented sector. The numbers of people in private rented accommodation have doubled since 2013, which means people on higher incomes are crowding out those on lower incomes in so far as some of them can afford the inflated prices. A catastrophe is unfolding. How will we address it? Given that the private sector did not address the housing problem during the boom period, the idea that it will do it now, when banks are afraid to lend money and the developers are interested only in making profits, is nonsense. The Government, in the Bill, is attempting to induce the landlords and developers further by cutting down the obligation to provide social housing. Even during the boom they fought to get out of their obligations by giving over cash and even argued about the amount of cash and housing and where they would give it. They fought it at every hand's turn, and our answer is to get down on our knees even further by reducing their obligation to deliver social housing. There will be very concrete consequences. In my area, there is a second phase of a NAMA development in which the same private developers who got us into the mess are back running it under the auspices of NAMA. Under the legislation, in a situation in which our housing list is growing by 1,200 per year, a development will happen in which we would have got 20% but will now get only 10%. The development contribution the developers must give to the council will be reduced. The very developers who got us into the mess will be put back in business and what they will deliver in terms of a social dividend for social housing for the huge numbers on the list will be even less and the contribution in development levies will be less. It is a flipping disgrace. There is constant pandering to and reliance on the private sector. The Clerys debacle is linked to this. The person who has just bought Clerys was in NAMA. I refer to Deirdre Foley of D2 Private. D2 Private was given a massive write-down on money it owed to NAMA, and the same people have been resurrected and have managed to scrabble together money to buy Clerys and put all those workers, some of whom had been there for 30 or 40 years, out of work. This is urban regeneration. People whose massive loans were discounted by NAMA – in other words by the public – are back in business, have bought Clerys and workers have been shoved out the door with nothing. We need a major emergency, State-led housing programme and we need the State to build tens of thousands of houses. We cannot hope or wait for the private sector to do it. It will not, no matter how much the Minister tries to induce it. This means we must get the capital investment to do it. It is a priority. Even today’s macro-financial review by the Central Bank says rising rents and property prices and what is happening in the residential and commercial property sectors constitute a major macroeconomic domestic threat to the entire economy. If we cannot house people, the economy cannot function. The cost for families, children, the economy and the future is dire. I am sorry to say it, and I wish I could say otherwise, but the Bill is rubbish. It is the sort of rubbish that got us into the mess before and we need to shift policy radically towards a State-led emergency public housing programme and the immediate introduction of rent controls.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	The legislation arises from the planning and development (No. 1) Bill that was debated at pre-legislation stage at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last December. Amid a full legislative schedule in the Department, we are seeing a hiving off of certain policy aims into vehicles such as this Bill. I acknowledge the hard work by the Department officials that goes into framing legislation, and I appreciate they are doing this towards tackling the housing crisis. However, I question the Government's methods. The Government came to power in the midst of an economic crisis, which was partly caused by a defective planning system that was led by developers and the construction sector. The planning system was dominated by builders and developers, and I have been speaking about that for the past 20 years. The system has not served the citizen very well. What I really want to say is, here we go again. The Labour Party campaigned on ending developer-led planning. The party's 2011 manifesto said it wanted to "link planning permission for residential developments to the provision of public transport, healthcare, recreational areas, shops and facilities". I totally agree with this approach. Instead, there will be more short-termism, a lack of a strategic approach, the big, 11th hour approach to deal with a crisis that some of us have been talking about for the past couple of years. Yesterday, the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, wrote to each of the four Dublin local authorities to tell them the "viability of new development and therefore supply will be placed at risk by insertion of unreasonable or excessive requirements in relation to the standard of housing or ancillary services”. The Ministers criticised facilities that "impact adversely on the economic viability of commercial investment". We need to know what the Government means by this.When I was involved with the Dublin Transport Initiative in the early 1990s, we discussed the potential for higher densities in urban areas. High density developments were envisaged to include family housing as well as small apartments aimed at single people. That mix never materialised in areas where public transport and other facilities already exist. I ask the Minister of State to indicate what kind of changes he envisages. The last thing we need is the bare minimum of standards. If we compromise we will have to pay for retrofitting later. Some developers are responsible and forward thinking. I have seen a number of good quality developments. We need to learn from these people rather than reward the bad behaviour of rogue developers. I have made several suggestions in this regard which I had hoped would be included in the legislation by this stage. I also introduced a Bill which was not opposed but that did not mean it got onto the Statute Book. That is disappointing because some of us have several decades of experience in this area. As this is my second crash, I have a bit of a head-start on some of the issues arising.

I recognise that we need to increase the supply of housing and I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the emergency in our public housing stock and the need to fast track social housing construction. There are regular announcements of large sums of money but the delivery of housing units is limited. We have faced a crisis for the last couple of years. I presented the Minister, Deputy Kelly, with five sample cases of families in my areas who were told to find a solution for themselves. There is no emergency short-term accommodation if one happens to live in County Kildare. In regard to the changes to Part V, I made a proposal on a sunset clause which appears unlikely to make its way into the Bill. The sunset clause would set a time limit of three years on the reduced requirement for social housing, after which point the measure would be reviewed. It should not last indefinitely if it is being used as an incentive in the context of the present environment. The mere fact of a review in three years' time may be sufficient incentive for developers to increase supply. The Bill closes off the option of a cash alternative to constructing housing under Part V. Can the Minister of State indicate whether large-scale developers will be able to negotiate rental accommodation agreements with long leases instead of permanently handing over houses that can be purchased? We need to be assured that there will be permanency in housing provision. The construction industry is very good at negotiating but local authorities are often at a huge disadvantage because they do not have the same skill-sets, which can result in poor deals. How many houses does the Minister of State expect to be delivered under these arrangements? I welcome the vacant site levy even though it is limited to certain areas and I would like it to have wider application. However, we have had a bad experience with the Derelict Sites Act 1990. I would like more assurances that the levy will work. Perhaps an impact analysis on the impact of the levy would be helpful. I expected the Bill to include provisions on co-responsibility with voluntary housing associations to allow them to leverage funds from the European Investment Bank. This appears to fall far behind what the construction sector wants. I also proposed that a register of developers be established against whom enforcement notices were issued. We have seen bad examples of developers going from one county to another and leaving a trail of destruction behind them. If an enforcement notice issues against a persistent offender, a house purchaser should be able to find that information on a public register. This would put the purchaser into a better position. We need to start seeing this kind of openness. I hope section 180 will be amended in the planning and development (No. 2) Bill. We are paying a significant price because the timeframe was too long and bonds expired. People are stuck with houses that are in negative equity while also finding it impossible to get their estates taken in charge because of issues with management companies. They end up incurring additional financial burdens which make it even more difficult to pay off their mortgages. I hope the planning and development (No. 2) Bill will deal with some of those issues.

We are only tinkering at the edges of the crisis with this Bill, which we are ramming through at this hour of the night. It is like a fellow getting a blow-out and having someone come along with a bicycle pump to inflate the tyre. It is nonsense. I commend the Minister of State on his work as a councillor over the years. However, his colleague, the Minister, arrived from on high and is still on high. He is slowly coming down to the ground but he will crash one of these days. It is clear that he does not know the first thing about how county councils operate or the different bits and pieces of local authorities. He arrived in Clonmel recently in the company of the good Minister of State, Deputy Coffey. He did not tell the chairman of the county council or the mayor of the town that he was announcing €3.8 million for housing in Tipperary. It was manna from Alan the superman. The county council is still waiting to get in writing the amount of money being provided. It is all spin. From the time that man gets up in the morning until he goes to bed at night, he is in a spin but he will fly off the spinning top one of these days because he will be found out. That is the fact of the matter. I was surprised that he brought the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, along to drub him into it. The Minister of State has a proud record that stands much better than the Minister's. The Minister stated that the Government published a comprehensive Construction 2020 strategy for a renewed construction sector. The strategy is supposed to encompass 75 specific actions. If somebody does not want to do something, he or she will announce 75 specific actions. Five actions would have been enough but, of course, this is a case of confuse, mix up and make up. The Minister will not have written down the 75 actions before he gets thrown out of Government in the next election, never mind implement them.That is the kind of poppycock we are getting from this Minister. We thought the last one was bad, but come back Big Phil, all is forgiven. Look at what he left us, in the name of God. I know of good building and construction companies that operated Part V and it was successful. Cutting the social and affordable housing provision from 20% to 10% is a non-runner and is stupid. I know who sought that reduction. It was the big business people in the Construction Federation of Ireland and NAMA, which is another acronym but we know where its interests are. When NAMA was established I said it was like a wild animal in the woods and no one knew where it would end up. We now know where it has ended up, with property portfolios in every town and village with weeds growing out of them. It has caused anguish, pain and trauma for many people, but is a gravy train for developers who are the chosen ones. They are picked to work with NAMA and are paid handsomely. They are getting side deals and cushy deals, which is nothing short of an outrage. There is no point in doing anything here if we do not deal with rent control, so the Minister of State should also be working with the Department of Social Protection in this regard. The 3% levy on vacant sites will not be paid until 2019, but God knows where the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will be at that stage. He certainly will not be in this Parliament anyway. We will be waiting until 2019, which is such a flippant way of dealing with people. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, will be around because he is a practical man, but the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will certainly not be here. We may as well be talking to Mars in 2019 and that is the sad fact of it. There is plenty of legislation involving local authorities, including that for dealing with derelict sites. Local authorities can be proactive in dealing with such sites in rural towns and villages. There are derelict sites in my county and every other county, but local authorities should be proactive in that regard. They should be supported by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but they are not getting a cent to regenerate these places and get businesses reopened. Rent reliefs and other schemes are required to support struggling businesses. The Government got it in the teeth this week when it was boasting about the economy. We are tired of reports saying the economy is booming, while under the Government's nose came a bolt from the blue when Clerys, a long-established business, went belly-up. As the Minister of State knows, other businesses are hanging on by their fingernails in Portlaw, Dungarvan and Tramore. I know it is happening in other counties and anyone here who is honest also knows it. Businesses are hanging on but they cannot continue to do so because banks are not giving them a shilling. Meanwhile, they are trying to compete with NAMA-run properties, including hotels, which are running at below cost price. It is not a fair trading pitch therefore. The Bill considers 75 specific actions but ignores the elephant in the room, which is NAMA. It is much bigger than an elephant now and one cannot even get up on it. What is NAMA? It is something that is out of control. The Minister could deal with this practically in many ways if he wanted to. However, this legislation was stuck in because there is an election coming up and perhaps the Labour Party was prodding the Minister to make it look good, as if he was interested and might do something. I welcome the Bill's provision for a review of development charges which are very high in many counties. If there is to be a downward review, I would welcome it if it is retrospective for those who have obtained planning permission. I want to talk about rural regeneration and the voluntary housing sector. The Minister, Deputy Kelly, made a pure bags of this as well. He announced a review of the legislation that was passed here last year, despite us all appealing that no one should pass it. The architects wanted it of course. With one stroke of a pen, he put an extra charge of €1,600 or €2,000 on people building their own houses in the country. It was voted through the lobbies but when the Minister, Deputy Kelly, took over the reins he got up on his horse and stopped the pony. He said he would have a review of this and change it because it was unacceptable.  Five people in my own area have planning and builders and designers waiting to go but they are waiting for Alan the great, Alan the mighty.

Of course, he is the Minister. They might as well go out to Mount Melleray and pray to a statue out there because there is no review. Building activity has ceased in every county because of this phoney promise made by a phoney Minister. He is a man who got to know everything in a very short time. He should have crawled before he walked and walked before he ran, but he came in at a gallop and he will go out at a canter. That is as sure as I am sitting here because that is what people in Tipperary are telling me every day. There is not much point in going to Portroe to announce something, to Bansha to announce a bus shelter, and Carrick-on-Suir to announce something that someone else has already announced, or which the Minister of State was supposed to open. It was a housing development that was done in the time of the previous Government, but no one has opened it yet because the Minister will not let the Minister of State do so. He has to do everything. He was down in Cork last week because he wants to announce and open everything. If an envelope was already open, he would put gum on it and re-open it. Those are the instructions he is giving. He is only interested in self gratification, self proclamation and to hell with the ordinary people. We are in a housing crisis but Tipperary County Council does not have a shilling for emergency accommodation. All it has are phone numbers for social welfare, a housing agency in Waterford city, and two shelters in Carlow and Kilkenny. Unfortunate homeless people do not even have a bus fare to go to Waterford, Carlow or Kilkenny. They have to send them down to the social welfare office to get the price of a bus fare. The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, announces millions for Tipperary but it is the greatest con job. It is time that the officials in South Tipperary County Council stood up to this blunder, bluff and baloney because they do not have a penny or a shilling. We discussed this recently at a meeting between the county manager and local Oireachtas Members. I salute the housing officers who do tremendous work under difficult conditions, but because the Government has diminished local democracy, there are no local housing authorities. South Tipperary County Council has now had to look for places as far as Portumna. Some of them do not even know where these places are and I do not blame them. We now have less money than we had for half the county before now. It is farcical and has gone beyond the extreme. It is despicable. It is not good enough to put patches on a bicycle tyre to repair a blow-out. I worked in the voluntary housing sector and was on the board of the Irish Council for Social Housing or ICSH. It has a huge capacity to build, develop and deliver houses quickly. There were no quick bucks, big developers, NAMAs or architects. The ICSH could deliver turn-key projects, while the Minister did diddly-squat, but the big friends of Fine Gael would not be supported then.

It was announced recently that up to 2017 some €30 million will be made available to Galway County Council and €28 million to Galway City Council. That is to build 608 houses in the county and 518 houses in the city. It is a welcome allocation but more is needed. Nonetheless I commend the Minister of State and the Department for making that welcome start on social housing. I also understand that the capital assistance scheme will be announced in the very near future. I welcome the Bill. One of the signs of the economy in recovery is its impact on housing. A few years ago, in 2010 and 2011, many people thought we would never have to build housing again because we had an over-supply nationwide. Now, however, we do not have enough housing units. Added to the complexity is the regional imbalance. We continue to have an oversupply of houses in certain parts of the country, including ghost estates, while in other areas there is little demand. This Bill started as the Planning and Development Bill, but has since been changed to the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015. Presumably this is to reflect supply-related issues in the Dublin area, which we all acknowledge, and where they are especially acute. However, a Dublin focus would overlook other areas, as would a city focus. There are places in close proximity to cities and urban areas within our large rural towns that we also need to examine concerning housing. In Galway, like other cities, in the last decade there was never an over-supply of housing.Local authority officials and councillors did not facilitate the unnecessary building of houses. However, with a growing population, an increase in the number of jobs and falling unemployment, there is an increased demand for housing in Galway. As figures from the Department show, the number of new homes built in 2013 was half that built in 1990, that is, 25 years ago when the country was in recession. The second issue which is a major factor in the housing shortage in Dublin is the absence of a realistic and workable regional development plan. For several decades successive Governments have not afforded proper attention to balanced regional development. There has been much talk and many initiatives, but these have not succeeded. The population and migration trends are indisputable and have been moving in the same direction for decades. We now have a situation where one in three people live in the greater Dublin area. One in two or 50% of the population live in Leinster. This is not sustainable or in the best interests of the country at large. Unbalanced growth can have negative effects on these areas, as well as negative impacts on living standards. These impacts include pressure on housing places, leading to housing shortages; unattainable and unrealistic house prices for home purchase or even renting; pressure on infrastructure, requiring substantial investment in roads, electricity, water supply infrastructure, etc; and pressure on hospitals, schools and recreation areas. These are evident in places in Dublin and the high population areas in the east. The surge in population growth in the east is having a negative impact on everyone's living standards. However, there are other areas, whether in the west, north west, south west or midlands, where there is capacity to expand substantially, enhance existing communities and provide for a better quality of life for people in these areas. While certain people will make remarks about certain parts of the west and may want to turn them into theme parks or a giant national park, it is important that we have continued regional development, with clear actions and clear points of responsibility to achieve this end. We have an opportunity to secure our economic recovery and rebuild society on a sustainable and balanced basis. The provisions in the Bill include a vacant site levy and reform of planning legislation. They represent a start and positive steps in the right direction. Sections 3 to 26, inclusive, introduce a vacant site levy. This is significant and welcome. At a time of great housing need, it is scandalous that over 60 ha of land in Dublin lie vacant and unused. This is a personal view and obviously an issue for Dublin's elected officials. In certain parts of Dublin there is need for a move upwards in terms of high quality housing in certain areas, something we see in other cities. I realise the creation of a vacant site register is a significant undertaking. This is apparent in sections 6 to 12, inclusive, which set out how each local authority should create a register. However, the operational date of 1 January 2019 seems to be some distance away. I realise the idea of the Bill is to incentivise developers to use land and that the date is so far out that they might not incur penalties. The idea is that this will encourage them to build on the land and provide housing. I have concerns that it is a late start date for enforcement and might not bring about the change needed now. We need this housing now. I welcome the provision in section 16 whereby the vacant site levy will not apply in cases of negative equity. It would be unfair to impose a levy in cases where the value of the mortgage used to acquire the land ended up, through no fault of the buyer, exceeding the market value of the land. Does the definition of a vacant site include a house or an upstairs apartment or is it simply a vacant site? Should there be an inventory of the available housing that perhaps, subject to investment, could be made habitable or fit for living within town centres? Many town centres are dying, while at the same time we have housing shortages. We need to examine why certain units, whether upstairs flats above shop fronts etc., are not being made available. It is time to revitalise town centres. What incentives are needed? For example, let us consider parking. Many people may choose not to rent or buy because there is no parking available. What can be done in respect of underground or back-land car parking? Local authorities will levy a developer for a parking space if he or she cannot provide it, yet the same local authorities may not even provide parking either. Sometimes paid-for parking in town centres can have a negative impact on the town because of over-zealous enforcement of parking charges. This is a disincentive to people living in centres, as well as a disincentive to job creation and retention within cities. Another positive element of the Bill is the abolition of the system of contributions in lieu of social housing obligations, as is the case under section 96 of the original 2000 Act. I am certain that during the first decade of this century this mechanism was used to fund far more than housing provision within local authorities and that the funding provided under the original scheme was ring-fenced for housing but with substantially less housing demand and higher levels of home ownership. I recognise that the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, has stated this policy had been in place since 2000. He has estimated that, had it not been in place, there would be an additional 15,000 social housing units in Ireland today, which would have represented a major addition to the housing stock available. The Bill also removes the ability of developers to build to meet their social housing requirements in an area away from the main development, and rightly so. This meant that developers in the more prosperous areas and with the better sites and higher quality housing in these areas were building housing to meet their social housing requirements in other towns miles away, creating ghettoisation. It is welcome that this will be discontinued. Section 29 deals with a development contributions initiative. I welcome the initiative whereby a new development contribution scheme will be adopted in a county. I know that local authorities had the ability to reduce the incentive because many of the development contribution schemes that might have been put in place during the Celtic tiger years were no longer valid or reasonable for developers. Therefore, where contributions are reduced, under section 29 a developer will be able to retrospectively avail of the reduced development contributions. Where there is planning and where developers intend to build or purchase a given site, we need them to build the houses as quickly as possible to provide the much needed construction jobs within the sector. I certainly also welcome this initiative. There may be some developers, including small developers, who were in the game in the past and who are now trying to fund new developments. Not everyone can turn his or her hand to become a housing developer and build 25, 50, 100 or 150 houses. There is a risk. People need experience, funding and finance. I know that under Construction 2020 the Department of Finance set about examining the issues regarding access to debt and equity finance for construction development. A report was produced in March or April this year. There are still issues in terms of developers who receive a certain amount of funding or equity from a bank but do not have the balance because they have been out of the building game for a given period or there may be other reasons they are simply not in a position to build. They may be in a position where they cannot proceed with their plans. It is clear that the Bill contains many positive measures which will ensure the sensible use of land, increase the number of houses available and remove the opt-out clause which has contributed to housing shortages in the past. I have to qualify this by saying there is a shortage in certain places because of an absence of a sensible workable spatial strategy to encourage regional balance. If we continue with a move towards Dublin and Leinster, it will have an even greater knock-on impact and we will never be able to solve the housing shortage problem in the greater Dublin area. I commend the Bill to the House. Certainly, there is more to do, but it is an important first step to boost construction and provide the much needed supply of houses.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Bill which is part of the response to the housing shortage, an issue that has been well aired in this Chamber and the media. We know that we need a multifaceted approach. I consider this to be emergency-type legislation in the sense that we are proposing to introduce a vacant site levy, which is a penalty on people who own property. In the normal course we protect property rights, except when it is a matter of public interest. I understand there are qualifications on the protection of property rights and that the case is being made that it is in the greater good for certain steps to be taken. I note that the legislation seeks to address issues of supply and land-holding, where land will be freed up where people are holding onto it and that it will be made available for housing, with the effect of boosting the construction sector, which in the process will be a double win, so to speak. However - I have spoken about this matter before - I am concerned about the operation of the vacant site levy in rural constituencies such as mine - Mayo. I would like to think such a vacant site levy would not apply. There is a reason for saying this.Based on the general case I intend to set before him, the Minister of State might offer a view as to how he sees the vacant-site levy operating. There is nobody homeless in my home county of Mayo at this time, but there is a substantial local authority housing list of more than 3,000 people. Fortunately, all of those people are currently housed in private rented accommodation. Some people in the county are in housing that requires improvement and others need a change of housing to better suit their needs. At the same time, new housing estates in some towns contain empty properties. The idea that there is a housing need in Mayo and other rural counties in the same way that there is such a need in Dublin, Cork, Galway or any of the main cities is not correct. As such, a vacant-site levy would be unduly onerous for private property owners in rural counties where a local authority decides to indicate a housing need in its development plan. I am not saying there will not be that need in the future but, for now, the main issue is a social housing need, which is somewhat different from a general housing shortage. My concern is that the owners of these vacant or under-utilised sites are not major property owners. There is no real market in many of the towns in my county for these properties and it would not be commercially viable to refurbish them for letting, whether for commercial or housing purposes. In many cases, moreover, owners would be unable to obtain the financing to do that. Considering the market conditions that are prevailing in rural Ireland, the proposed levy is unfair and inequitable. In short, the problem it seeks to address is a city-based one. The situation is simply not the same as between rural Ireland and urban Ireland, as other speakers have acknowledged. I would describe even the towns in my county as rural. The people who will be impacted are ordinary citizens, not property speculators or developers. They will be penalised for having a property they probably cannot sell and cannot afford to refurbish. That is not right. In such situations, where there is not the same housing need as exists in Dublin and other cities, is it the expectation that local authorities will introduce a vacant-site levy? The definition of "vacant site" refers to regeneration land which has an adverse effect on the existing amenities or character of the area. In a county like Mayo, that is covered by the Derelict Sites Act. People may improve the visual appearance of their home or property such that it is not detracting unduly from the surrounding properties, which is covered under that Act. Will the Minister of State comment on that issue? This legislation needs to include provision in respect of local authorities and housing authorities. As it stands, it contains a specific exclusion whereby councils will not have the same duties and responsibilities as private property owners. In Mayo and many other counties, a large number of the landbanks are owned by the local authority. Indeed, many of the rundown and inhabitable properties which have fallen into dereliction are owned by the council. It might temper the actions of local authorities in drawing up a plan to zone areas in which the vacant-site levy would apply if they had to subscribe to the same law as will apply to the private citizens who have to produce the money needed to bring properties up to standard. The provision should be amended to effect that change.

Will the Minister of State clarify whether it will be penalised in the same way as everybody else and challenged to deliver on housing? I refer here not to the property developers over which NAMA has a stranglehold but to the agency itself. I received a reply to a parliamentary question last week which contained some rather disturbing information in the context of our current housing shortage. The reply noted that a stability programme update was published by the Department of Finance in December 2009. As we know, NAMA was established in February of that year. It was projected at that stage, the reply notes, that we would need approximately 30,000 houses per annum to meet requirements. After seven years in existence, however, we have NAMA clapping itself on the bank for its plans to have 4,500 houses built in the greater Dublin area by 2016 and possibly an additional 20,000 around the country in the next five years or so. That is incredible. Is it any wonder we have a housing shortage? With all the property it controls, including development sites, NAMA should be playing a major role in addressing the housing shortage. It should be working with and funding developers towards this end. As Deputy Kyne said, not everybody has the wherewithal to undertake the scale of development that is required to meet our housing need. NAMA's failure in this regard is a major cause of the housing shortage in this country. Going back to urban regeneration, different market conditions prevail across the country, as I have outlined, and property hoarding is not occurring in Mayo and other rural counties. At the same time, however, we do have dilapidated market towns in these counties, and we must come up with a plan to bring them back to life. While we can seek to ensure the towns recover, it will never be the case that they will have multiple retail units on the scale there was before the recession. These towns require basic services and basic shops. In the past, small market towns had many shops selling the same types of goods, but we must face up to the reality that this is no longer sustainable. Some of the derelict commercial properties in the centres of these towns will never come back into commercial use. They are an eyesore and a reminder not only of the decline that has taken place but also of the changes in the way in which people now spend their money. Many consumers go to larger stores or make their purchases online. That does not mean there is not a place or a need for certain services in these towns, but the reality is that not all of those commercial premises will be returned to use. Rather than penalising the owners of such properties with vacant-site levies, we need well-designed tax incentive schemes which would make changing them to residential use affordable for their owners. Mayo County Council is working on a study to explore the repopulation of these towns from commercially zoned to residentially zoned where appropriate. This approach has already been undertaken to great effect in the town of Louisburgh, which has been transformed from commercial dereliction to a site of vibrant town housing. That initiative should set an example for other local authorities. An approach based on incentivising property owners rather than beating with them a stick will facilitate older people, for instance, in moving from the countryside into a safer environment. This might be part of the solution to dealing with the problems we are seeing in small towns throughout the country and could be tied in with efforts to address the social housing shortage. I hope the Minister of State will give this proposal serious consideration. Otherwise, these small market towns will be nothing but monuments. We must take the bull by the horns and allow some recognition that the situation is rural counties like Mayo is different from that in Dublin and other cities.

Caithfidh chuile dhuine a bheith ina chónaí i dteach agus tá go leor daoine anois atá á fháil rite leo teach a aimsiú. Caithim a rá nach dtagaim leis an gcineál tuairimíocht atá sa Bhille seo nó le tuairimíocht an Rialtais maidir le tithíocht. The lack of analysis and a broader view on the part of the Government, not only towards housing but also in respect of settlement policy, is quite frightening. If we do not have a big picture of what the country should like in ten, 20 or 30 years time, we are likely to repeat the mistakes of the past.We have a housing crisis, especially in our cities. In particular, we have a housing crisis in this city and it is being exacerbated every day by the Minister of State's Government because his Government has a policy of centralisation of everything into Dublin. The Government cannot seem to see that there is cause and effect. If it insists on all the jobs being in Dublin, all the people will be in the so-called GDA or greater Dublin area. For example, the Government cancelled any programme of decentralisation. Instead of having a policy that all new agencies, where it controls the jobs, would be set up outside the metropolitan area, it decided they would go to Dublin. Week in, week out, the Government consolidates all development here. Then it wonders why there is no housing in this city. Another thing we have to examine is the ability of all in our society to go in the one direction at the one time. This does not just apply to the Government. When there was a demand for housing, people in the private sector seemed to lose all reason and started building houses everywhere - from Donegal to Leitrim, Galway to Dublin, and Louth right down to Mizen Head. They kept building, without in any way doing a proper analysis on whether their investment would make them a return. Much of this was driven by a number of factors, including the media, which, week in, week out, in the Irish Farmer's Journal, national newspapers and everywhere, had property sections feeding into the frenzy. The amazing thing that also is true is that when certain parts of the country got into oversupply, everyone presumed all the country was in oversupply. No analysis seems to have taken place since this Government came into office. As my colleague, Deputy Kyne, said, in Galway we ensured we did not get into an oversupply situation. I remember campaigning, year in, year out, to try to ensure, as best I, as one person, could, that we did not get into this myopic building. Dublin never had a significant oversupply. It was easy to work out the supply situation. All one had to do was work out the average requirement of houses for the population. We knew that. I have those figures going back 40 and 50 years. Those figures could have been sub-segmented because one knew how many houses were being built in each area. Therefore, it was easily forecast by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that we were going to run out of houses in the metropolitan areas. We are going to start building again, but this time let us try to do it a little better. When I was a member of Galway County Council back in 1997, one of the last things I did on the council before I left it was argue that we needed to zone enough land around Oranmore to ensure a small number of property owners did not have inordinate control over the land supply. On the other hand, I was worried that if we zoned a reasonably significant amount of land, we would get a building explosion that would cause huge social difficulties around Oranmore. I suggested at the time, and lots of people threw cold water on it, that we should zone adequate land but we should put a codicil in the planning development plan providing that only a fixed number of houses could be built every year. This was something we introduced subsequently into county plans in Galway. That way one did not get caught with this tight parcel of land where the owner could say it was his land or no land. On the other hand, a huge amount of land was not zoned such that one would get a huge explosion of planning applications and lose control over the amount of houses provided. This time we need to ensure in our planning mechanisms that the number of houses we provide for meets the expected demand. The next issue we need to stand back and look at is the wider vision for ownership and ownership and renting structures and so on of houses. I was listening to Deputy Boyd Barrett, who seems to want us to go back into a crash programme like the Ballymun flats where the State would build enormous numbers of houses in massive, socially segregated estates. I know he does not like the private sector, but to see the private sector as one amorphous totality is, in my view, not to understand that the private sector is as varied as our society. I do not believe in building huge, monolithic, socially segregated estates. We can look to the past. All one has to do is look at the RAPID areas which the Department has neglected totally since this Government got into office. The common factor in the RAPID areas is massive local authority housing estates and social segregation of an obnoxious kind. I do not believe in that type of development. I also believe that as many people as possible should be enabled to own their own homes. There is a big difference between an individual family owning its own home and a small number of massive developers in the private sector controlling the development market. If given a choice between living in a house designed, controlled, built and everything else by a local authority and having the pride of owning one's own home, most people would rather own their own home. It is amazing that there seems to be a consensus on the idea that it is better for the State to fully build or fund the houses or pay rent to landlords than assist private home ownership. This goes against decisions we made in Government, but I have to say that I am not convinced that the elimination of the first-time buyer's grant was the great idea it was cracked up to be. I am not convinced that reducing mortgage interest relief, without which a lot of us would not have been able to build our own homes, was or is a good idea, although it is something that seems to have broad consensus among policy makers. We are pushing people onto the public housing market who could, with a little assistance, provide their own homes and which would be somewhere they would own. There is another thing I believe which relates to the building of housing estates. We all have to admit that when we canvass in the elections and go into the housing estates where we allowed people buy the houses, even at quite knock-down prices, we will always know the quality of the houses by the sliding door in the house and the flowers outside. It is easily seen: pride in ownership. I am amazed that every time I had to table a parliamentary question on the new tenant purchase scheme, the reply was always that it is coming soon. "Coming soon" is the great answer of the public service for not wanting to say when because it might be too far away and an issue might be made out of it. They keep stringing the person along. However, it cannot be that complicated to write the regulations and publish the scheme. One of the great advantages of living in rural areas is social integration. I was lucky that, even though I grew up in what is, funnily enough, reputedly one of the better-off parts of the city, it was much more socially integrated than might first meet the eye.Until recent times, one of the great attributes of living in rural Ireland was the fact that there was a socially integrated society. The person who had a very good job lived beside the person on social welfare. They went to the same school and played on the same team. They were friends and their employment status made no difference. We should try to mirror this, if possible, in urban areas. For that reason, I applaud one of the steps the Minister is taking and roundly condemn another. I agree fully that it was a major mistake to allow the buy-out clause under Part V. There was massive pressure in that regard. I recall representatives of the builders federation visiting me in Galway. As they were opposed to Part V at the time, it was a matter for discussion. I remember saying to them that they were opposing it because they did not want social housing in their housing estates. However, I also pointed out that at night they came to my clinic to complain about social deprivation and anti-social behaviour in the socially segregated areas and ask me why we had created them. Profit was their motive in day time, but at night time it was the social cohesion of the city in which they lived. I told them they could not have it both ways. The Minister should remove the buy-out clause and leave the percentage figure as it is, not take the route advocated by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett of building huge, segregated housing estates. The Minister should have courage and stand up to the vested interests in the industry. Ultimately, we would all reap the harvest, as one sees in the social deprivation to which Trutz Haase and other sociologists point when one opts for social segregation. When one looks at the figures, it is no coincidence that the areas of greatest social deprivation, with the highest prison populations and the greatest levels of anti-social behaviour, are in urban areas, with high concentrations of local authority housing. We must, therefore, integrate urban societies in the way rural societies are integrated. It is very important that we do not pull back on anything related to the standard of housing. It is absolutely crazy to hear talk that we should not be so strict when it comes to housing standards, building standards and so forth for urban housing, while, at the same time, putting an extra €10,000 or €15,000 onto the cost of a one-off house in a rural area where the person concerned supervises the building of his or her own house and where in my experience the chances of it not being built correctly are very slim. The Minister is from a rural and an urban constituency. Did he see many building problems with one-off houses people built for themselves on their own land, where they had commissioned and supervised the building? I doubt it. Is it not ironic that people are talking about not being strict with big builders?

I referred to section 2 of the Bill, but it is section 4 that sets out the exemption of a local authority. The vacant site levy does not apply to a local authority as a housing authority. This is provided for in section 4 in Part 2.

Bhí mé istigh anseo ag déanamh mo chuid oibre. As I said, it is very important that we maintain the standard of housing. The PRTB system requires urgent reform. When I was Minister for Social Protection, I worked with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to try to ensure registration of all properties took place before rather than after letting and that every property would be required to have a report before it was let stating it met adequate standards and had an adequate BER rating. With so many people living in rented housing, it is vital we ensure they are living in properties of an adequate standard. Furthermore, if we were to insist on full registration with the PRTB before letting, we could ensure there was full compliance with Revenue Commissioners' requirements also. I refer to the issue of Traveller housing. Ordinary people find it difficult to rent housing. There is an amazing and unprecedented housing crisis. Travellers, however, face even greater problems owing to the huge social prejudice against them. One of the aspects of the Government's tenure of office that shocks me is the constant reduction of money for Traveller housing. If the Minister checks his Department's records, he will see that there have been disproportionate cuts in that sector. I refer him to the latest work of Fr. Micheal McGreal which shows that the Traveller community suffers the greatest apartheid, as he calls it, in our society. Instead of trying to do something about it, the Minister has added tremendously to this policy.
