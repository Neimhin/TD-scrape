Before I go into detail as to the location of these centres, it is important to make clear why I am raising this matter. It is very simple. Day care centres are a lifeline for many older people. Above all, they provide company, a social setting and an opportunity to meet other people of a similar age in a social setting and to chat in a warm, safe and cosy space. Most day centres provide a meal and often a bit of entertainment, such as a sing-song, a few basic exercises or a game of cards. Crucially, most of them provide services like chiropody or shower facilities. It depends. They also provide people with information about their own healthcare. They also point them in the direction of other services that may help them. I recently visited a day care centre in Ballymote, County Sligo, run by the Sligo LEADER group. It was just lovely. People were delighted to be there. They could not stop telling me how much it meant to them to have the centre for a few hours five days per week. It was a warm, welcoming and comfortable place. On the day I was there, there were musicians who I believe come regularly. Some people were brought to the centre by local bus services, while others walked and or got a lift. They got a great opportunity to have a chat about lots of different things, including with the staff. One of the things that struck me was that, for those few hours, two heated rooms of a decent size kept 20 people warm. People were delighted that their day care centre reopened. I will give a shout-out to the Sligo LEADER group and the HSE, which provided funding to make sure this happened. I asked person after person how much it meant to them because I had received various representations from people who were concerned about centres not reopening and every person was grateful to have this day care centre. I felt bad for the older people in other parts of Sligo and Leitrim, many of whom are living alone, who do not have such a centre.  I raised this matter with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions with specific regard to St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon, Arus Carolan in Mohill, the centre in Manorhamilton, which is down to two days, the Easky centre in County Sligo, those in Cliffoney and Carrigans, and the centre in Ramelton, County Donegal, about which I had a query. He said he would raise it with the Minister and, since then, I have received a response from the HSE. St. Patrick's in Carrick-on-Shannon is a walk-in centre beside the old folks' home. Houses for older people were specifically built beside St. Patrick's so that people could be close to the day services. On any given day, 20 to 30 people might have dropped in. Sometimes people travelled by bus. Covid came and the service was closed. It never reopened. People want to know when the centre is going to reopen. In a response from the HSE, I was told that there was a number of other centres in Leitrim suitable for people and five were listed. Drumsna is 7 km away, Ballinamore is 28 km, Drumkeeran is 29 km, Carrigallen is 36 km and Ballinagleragh is 53 km away. Whoever sent me that response knows nothing about County Leitrim and older people getting to care centres.  What can be done about St. Patrick's and the Easky centre in County Sligo. The centre in Easky is still running two days a week only. We are told a recruitment campaign is under way. When can we hope for these centres to full reopen?

There are three key points in supporting older people to live well in their own homes: home care, day care centres and meals on wheels. When the three are working in collaboration with each other, it makes an important difference to an older person's life. As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health and personal social services including day centres. A wide range of core services are provided for older persons, including home support, day care, community supports in partnership with voluntary groups, such as the Sligo LEADER group the Deputy mentioned, and intermediate care as well as long-stay residential care when remaining at home is no longer feasible. These services are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population.  Access to day centres can make an important contribution by providing, as the Deputy said, invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may, for many reasons, be experiencing isolation and loneliness. Older people also benefit from increased physical activity, cognitive stimulation, enhanced nutrition, healthcare monitoring and social work support. Day centres are also an important indirect resource for carers. They play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities. The Deputy is as passionate as I am in wanting to see the resumption of day care services following their necessary closure in 2020 in response to Covid. In 2021, a general manager within older persons' services was requested to take the lead role on the resumption of day care services for older people. A day care focus group with both HSE and cross-organisational representation was established. During the pandemic, a risk assessment of each day care centre in the country was carried out. Some were not fit for purpose as regards infection prevention and control measures. Some did not even have hot running water in the bathrooms. We took this opportunity to reconfigure some day care centres. Key issues in reopening included staff being redeployed, some buildings no longer being fit for purpose under new guidance and others having challenges associated with HIQA requirements. The HSE allocated more than €6 million to the community health organisations between 2021 and 2022, within existing resources, to assist with the reopening of services and the expansion of existing services, where possible.  The reopening of day centres for older people as quickly and as safely as possible remains a priority for me. In budget 2023, I secured additional funding of €4.1 million for service resumption. The current target is to open 333 day care centres. At the end of October, 300 were open. Some 315 will have reopened by Christmas. We will also have 40 dementia-specific day care centres open by Christmas.I have been working very closely with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland to ensure that people with dementia can receive these supports. Like the Deputy, I have visited many daycare centres in the past few months and older people are so happy to be back and re-engaging again. Some of the centres are not open five days, four days or three days a week, like they were previously, because of staffing challenges but we are trying to work through that. The Deputy will be aware, as all Deputies will be, that many day care centres were dependent on community employment schemes to deliver some of the supports and because we are almost at full employment now, we have lost some of that resource that was available.  The reference to St. Patrick’s Community Hospital was not in the original question and, therefore, I do not have the detail on it but I will certainly look at it for the Deputy and I will return with more information in my supplementary response.

She mentioned, as I did, the importance of day care centres which is a social setting. It gives people an opportunity get out of their homes and makes such a difference to their mental health, as well as their physical health. That is all a given. The Minister of State stated that one of the reasons that some day care centres were not reopened related to infection prevention and control. While that is important, we have to strike a balance. We cannot just say "No, no, no" to the positive benefits of reopening as quickly as possible. I am not asking the her or anybody in the HSE to reopen centres that they consider dangerous or that would not be beneficial for people, but if everything has to be perfect, A1 down the list of tick boxes before a centre can open, she and I know that instead of the 333 centres that she had hoped to have opened at the end of October, as she has said or the 315 centres she hopes to be open by Christmas, that will not happen. That is good progress and she is getting there with her target and I hope that St Patrick’s Community Hospital and some of the other centres that I spoke about will be among those.  That will certainly give me great courage to think that could have happened but we need to be practical about this. According to the information I received, St. Patrick’s Community Hospital needed toilets to be refurbished, painting and a new floor. That is the sort of thing that can be done fairly quickly. Carrick-on-Shannon is the county town and the biggest town in Leitrim but to think that it is without a day care centre, and to think that somebody sent me a response to say that there were centres open with the exception of one, a small centre 25 km to 53 km away is nonsense. Carrick-on-Shannon needs to be prioritised and the other centre that is causing a great deal of concern is Easky, County Sligo.

We all know the benefits of day care centres. It is one of my priorities to get them open as safely and as securely as possible. One of the areas where we have seen challenges is in day care centres that were adjacent to or part of amenity nursing units, which were our old style community hospitals. Any place in which there was a day care centre, there were challenges. We still have approximately 70 nursing homes throughout the country with Covid-19. The difficulties were that we were bringing people from outside into an inpatient centre and most of the problems we had were where the day care centre was associated with the community nursing hospital in that particular area. The Deputy is correct about infection prevention and control, which is important. We learned quickly that some of the day care centres were in community facilities and were not dedicated day care facilities. We have changed that now and the majority of them are now stand-alone day care centres with the correct supports that people need. The Deputy is also correct in that we have to find permanent solutions and that is what we are trying to do but there have to be certain standards. One area about which I am also worried is that while many people have come back to day care and embraced it, we also have a small cohort who are finding it hard to re-engage and who have not come back to the day care centres. They may have lost their good friend during Covid-19 with whom they used to engage, and this is also an area on which we are putting a focus. I am asking communities to reach out to these people who always went to a day care centre previously and now do not have the heart or are probably afraid to re-engage. I will certainly check out those centres for the Deputy.  I agree with what she said in that it is not appropriate to ask somebody to travel 7 km, who may not have transport, and I believe the Deputy also mentioned a distance of 24 km. That is just not going to happen. I will check those two centres out for the Deputy and I thank her, as usual, for her interest in this matter.

The European Commission recently published a new study on breast cancer screening across the European Union. One of its recommendations was to extend breast cancer screening to include women from the ages of 45 to 74. As the Minister of State knows, in Ireland, the screening process begins at 50 and ends at 69. The European Union is saying that for better outcomes for women, the screening process age should be lowered to 45 and end at 74. The figures and evidence are quite compelling in respect of breast cancer in Irish women. One in nine million women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. Recovery rates from the disease are high, which is important. The startling statistic, however, is that 23% of all women who are detected are under the age of 50. Between the ages of 20 and 50, the figure is 23%. Some 36% of the women who are diagnosed are over 70. Some 56% of women then are not in that screening process. The evidence is, therefore, quite compelling in respect of the lowering of the screening age for women. For example, in some European countries the age of screening starts at 45. Sweden, which is a good example, starts at 40. That country has found that when it started the process of screening at 40, there were 26% fewer deaths, which is a good result. The national screening advisory committee, NSAC, has stated that it will prioritise the proposal by the Commission. Will the Government take on the Commission’s report? Will it review the current screening process and, as women will ask for, will it lower the age of screening as per the recommendations of the Commission?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	6	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and it is great to get the opportunity to discuss it. The Minister and myself are committed to supporting our national population-based screening programmes. As we all know, screening saves lives and it is important that decisions on changes to our existing screening programmes, such as changes to the age range eligible for screening, are made in line with international best practice. When a woman turns 50, she receives a notification to attend her BreastCheck appointment and the take-up is very high, which is great to see. Many people who are screened find that they might be challenged with breast cancer. As the Deputy said, the outcomes are good. As he may know, decisions about population-based screening in Ireland are made on the advice of the NSAC. This independent, expert committee makes recommendations to the Minister and the Department of Health on population screening in Ireland. As he may appreciate, the assessment of the evidence for making changes to screening programmes is a thorough process, done in line with internationally accepted criteria and with scientific rigour. In addition to the scientific and technological information required to make evidence-based decisions, ethical, legal and societal issues arise when planning an enduring population-based screening programme of this nature.  As the Deputy stated, BreastCheck currently invites women aged 50 to 69 for screening. Extending the programme to those up to the age 69 was a programme for Government commitment, which I am pleased to note has been met and is now being implemented. The NSAC's first annual call in 2021 for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received more than 50 submissions. This included proposals on expansion of the age range eligibility for breast cancer screening from a number of sources, including from the BreastCheck programme.  The NSAC have asked HIQA to look at the evidence for the expansion of the age range eligibility for breast screening to women aged between 45 and 74 and preliminary scoping work has begun. I agree wholeheartedly that it would be important to extend the range. One person contacted me who had contracted breast cancer at the age of 45. She was lucky in that she was proactive and went about dealing with it.She made the point that many others have breast cancer and do not realise it. I think that 45 years is a good age to start and I am glad that the BreastCheck programme has also endorsed this. Under Europe’s beating cancer plan, a proposal for an updated European Council recommendation on cancer screening was adopted by the Commission in September. The final recommendation is expected to be formally approved by the Council of the European Union on 9 December and then published.  The NSAC will consider the recommendation and advise the Minister and the Department of Health on the evidence as it applies to Ireland, including in respect of breast screening. It is important to remind ourselves that screening is for healthy people without symptoms and I advise everyone to take up their invitation for screening when they receive it.  It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. In light of all this, I trust the public can be assured of the Minister’s and my own ongoing commitment to further expansion of population-based screening in Ireland. It cannot happen soon enough. It is such an important provision.  The Deputy noted that it is 33% under 50 years and 36% over 70 years. Expanding the programme by those extra nine years could have many positive outcomes for women's health.

This will take time and more resources. I was on the health committee where experts were brought in to talk about the pros and cons of extending the screening process. The case was quite compelling. It makes it less evasive. There is also an issue of women seeking early diagnosis. I know it can be lengthy and can run into years. For any cancer, early diagnosis and prognosis is important. The Commission's support for the new European Council recommendation is positive and I am glad NSAC has taken it on. There is compelling evidence for reducing the age to 45. If it saves one life, and if there is one person watching this is saved, it will be worth it. Anything is worth it if it saves one life. I am quite positive. There will be extra costs and resources but the Department of Health and the NSAC are willing to take that on and, hopefully, they will implement it as soon as possible.

As he said, if it saves one life, it will be important. I reiterate how important it is that people are invited to screening appointment, they take it up. Some 13,000 people in Ireland a year are diagnosed with skin cancer. I was one of those people this year. Thankfully, even though I had a malignant tumour, I was lucky that I got the all clear recently after two procedures. It does focus the mind when you realise that there can be positive outcomes if it is caught early enough. The latest cancer trends report, published by the National Cancer Registry Ireland recently, focuses on cancers that are currently screened for, including breast cancer. The report highlighted the positive effect BreastCheck has had on breast cancer incidence and mortality in Ireland. The Minister and myself are committed to the further expansion of screening in Ireland. It is something I will keep a close eye on because of the points the Deputy made in favour of extending the programme to those aged 45 and aged 74. Population-based screening programmes must be considered thoroughly and carefully and assessed against international accepted criteria but all the criteria and international best practice are going in the same direction. I am positive that we can move on this.
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	9	I am grateful that the Minister of State has come to the House to take all these matters this morning. It is great credit to her own work ethic and commitment. I raise a somewhat niche issue in that it only affects a small number of women in the country but it is serious. Hyperemesis is severe nausea, or morning sickness, during pregnancy. It affects 1% to 2% of pregnancies. In budget 2023, the Minister for Health announced that Cariban, which treats hyperemesis, will be reimbursed. This is welcome and long sought-after. However, to get a prescription for Cariban, the patient must first go to a consultant rather than her GP. This adds delay and cost and creates a great deal of distress to women who are extremely sick during a vulnerable time in their lives. It is hard to describe how badly hyperemesis can affect those who are unfortunate enough to suffer from it during pregnancy but it is debilitating. That they would have to wait for a consultant appointment and be seen before they may be prescribed this prolongs the misery.  A lady in my constituency was diagnosed with hyperemesis at eight weeks. She was losing 2kg a week. This was before it was placed on the drugs payment scheme and she was not eligible to get this so she had to go onto a less effective drug until she was six months' pregnant. She became pregnant again more recently and again fell foul of hyperemesis and, unfortunately, had to wait an additional three weeks to be seen and prescribed by a consultant rather than just being able to get an appointment with her GP the next morning. That was three weeks off work, losing weight and away from the care of the infant child she had simply because there is no joined-up thinking. I am asking for a little bit of common sense in the application of this important scheme for those who need it most.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	10	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. The Minister and myself appreciate that hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe nausea, is a debilitating condition for women. The Minister is anxious that our health service should support women with this condition in every way possible. Improving women's health outcomes is a priority for the Minister and the Government. We made a strong commitment to promoting women's health in the programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of women's health services. We have made progress on women’s health issues. VAT has been removed from HRT, which has improved equality of access for women across the country. The free contraception scheme commenced this year and will be expanded to include women up to 30 years next year. IVF treatment will be provided in the public health system next year. We also intend to create additional women’s health hubs. These are all initiatives that will positively impact the lives of women in Ireland.  As part of the women's health agenda, officials supporting women's health in the HSE and the Department of Health worked with urgency to identify all of the available options to better support women with hyperemesis gravidarum. As part of budget 2023, the Minister announced €69.2 million in funding for women’s health in 2023, to include dedicated funding for Cariban. The dedicated funding for Cariban will help women who experience hyperemesis, a severe form of morning sickness, during pregnancy, which is difficult to deal with.  On the question of access to medicines to treat the condition, unfortunately the situation is not straightforward. As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. Under the Act, only items that have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority can be added to the reimbursement list. However, that is not the question the Deputy has asked. His question relates to where patients must go to a consultant before they can get a prescription for Cariban. I did not realise that.

The answer does not really deal with the question the Deputy is asking and, therefore, I will raise this with the Minister and his officials to see if anything can be done.Perhaps the Deputy can clarify, in his response, if a patient must go to a consultant and pay for that appointment in order to get the prescription to claim the cost back.

Unfortunately, there are situations like this with drugs and many different treatments all the time. The Minister of State deals with these issues on a daily basis, as does the Minister for Health. The situation, in this case, is that because of the nature of the drug and the regulatory environment with the European Medicines Agency, there is a requirement for patients to get a prescription from their GP, but they need to have a consultation with a consultant first. I note and welcome the Minister of State's comments. I hope, following engagement with the stakeholders, we can find an opportunity to provide timely treatment for the 1% to 2% of pregnant women who suffer from this debilitating condition. I highlight that the HSE has discretion in the area of exceptional patient-specific processes. We have seen it in the implementation and roll-out of other drugs for many other illnesses. It is about getting around the system of waiting for EMA regulatory approval. We saw it with Covid vaccines and we have seen it with many other medicines. The important point is that the condition is extremely time-sensitive. Women do not know if they are going to get hyperemesis gravidarum before they get pregnant. Often, the patient does not present with symptoms until the eighth or ninth week of pregnancy. There is a need to work quickly to treat the condition, so having to attend a consultant appointment not only delays treatment by up to four weeks but imposes a major cost on the women who simply have to get access to this drug. I ask the Minister of State, when she goes back to the Minister or, more pertinently, the HSE, to ensure that a system is put in place whereby there is no requirement for women to attend a consultant appointment in order to get a reimbursement. They should be able to get access to the drug through a GP because this is a time-sensitive exceptional need. I think all of us agree that Cariban is recognised as a safe drug. It is seen as such. We must ensure we put in place the process to get ahead of the delay on a wider regulatory matter.

If a woman is eight or nine weeks pregnant and is extremely sick, the last thing she wants to do is to get up and try to make a consultant appointment. Cariban, which is regarded as a beneficial treatment for hyperemesis, does not have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority and, therefore, cannot be added to the formal reimbursement list under the 2013 Health Act. I assume that is the reason women have to make a consultant appointment to access it. Of the €69.2 million in funding allocated for women’s health in budget 2023, €1 million is for the unlicensed medicine Cariban. As with the Minister for Health, I am hopeful that this medicine will make a meaningful difference to the well-being of pregnant women. There could be an opportunity for pregnant women to access the drug when they go for their regular check-ups and scans in a maternity hospital, without having to see a consultant privately. Perhaps that could be looked at and streamlined. I will certainly raise the issue with the Minister. By allocating the €1 million for Cariban in 2023, we can ensure that pregnant women who were not previously able to get Cariban can now access it. However, there seems to be one small barrier that we need to overcome. I will certainly raise the matter with the Minister. I thank the Deputy for bringing it to the House.

I raise the issue of funding for the Circle of Friends Cancer Centre in Tipperary town. To provide some background information, when I visited the centre first it was operating in an old building near the railway which was completely unsuitable for the purposes of what the organisation was trying to achieve. With huge voluntary fundraising efforts and donations, as well as Government support, a pristine cancer support centre has been built, which is a real credit to the people of Tipperary and the surrounding areas. For this centre to operate efficiently, it needs funds. Unfortunately, use of the centre has increased dramatically. It is estimated that 1,197 individuals will use the centre's services in 2022, which is a significant number. That figure is expected to double in 2023. The organisation has applied for section 39 funding from the HSE amounting to €98,318. The funding will be used to meet core staffing requirements and provide a cancer support outreach worker, counselling and individual therapies. There is a huge voluntary effort in this organisation, but the professional people who are providing counselling and therapy services have to be paid. They are providing supports such as physiotherapy, financial advice and others for people who have unfortunately been diagnosed with cancer. It would be a tragedy if the organisation were to run into funding difficulties after doing all the hard work in getting the new centre built and up and running. As I mentioned, the centre and its services are widely used by people living in Tipperary town, west Tipperary and County Limerick. It covers a catchment area of over 76,000 people. It is really delivering what it says on the tin. It is providing excellent counselling services in a superb environment. There are beautiful gardens surrounding the centre. Circle of Friends is getting help from community employment schemes for some of the services that are needed in respect of maintenance at the centre, etc., but the core issue I am raising is the need for funding to maintain the services. I have a detailed budget that I will pass on to the Minister of State, which breaks down the figures. The centre needs €98,318 in funding. I also emphasise strongly that the funding must be provided on a permanent basis. The organisation cannot live from hand to mouth, hoping that it will get funding from the HSE each year. I hope the section 39 funding application is accepted and funding can be provided more regularly and on a permanent basis, so that the organisation knows it will receive the funding it requires to provide its services in the following calendar year. That is imperative. I met with representatives of the organisation on Monday. While it has some financial reserves, they will only cover 12 months of running costs. If this centre is to survive long term, there must be certainty in respect of funding. We cannot talk about value for money when it comes to the provision of cancer support services. They are absolutely essential for people who are unfortunately diagnosed with cancer. I urge the Minister of State to use her influence to get funding for the centre.

I also thank and acknowledge the staff and volunteers for the valuable work they do at the centre. The need to address survivorship care for those living with and beyond cancer is now recognised internationally, and groups such as the Circle of Friends Cancer Support Centre emphasise the importance of quality of life during and after cancer treatment. People living can require life-long, evidenced-based healthcare, both preventive and general medical, as well as psychosocial care and care specific to the cancer diagnosis involved. For others, access to support groups can fulfil most of their needs. Circle of Friends has previously received funding through national lottery funding and from the HSE in 2018. I understand the charity has recently made an application for further funding through the HSE of €98,318, which the Deputy has previously discussed with me. I think it is very impressive that an estimated 1,200 people will avail of the supports that Circle of Friends provides in the Tipperary area. In 2020 and 2021, cancer services continued to be provided in Ireland during a challenging time for health services globally. The national action plan on Covid-19 identified the continued delivery of cancer care as a priority. Cancer diagnostic and treatment services continued to operate, including breast, lung and prostate rapid access clinics for cancer diagnosis.In 2021, the Government allocated €57 million to cancer services, with a further €35 million allocated in 2022. This has brought the total allocation for cancer services in the national service plan to €139.2 million. This includes funding provided by the national cancer control programme to cancer support centres across the country. Hospital and Community-based Psychosocial Care for Patients with Cancer and their Families: A Model of Care for Psycho-Oncology was published by the national cancer control programme in 2020. It sets out how psychosocial support for cancer patients and their families will be developed in Ireland over the coming years. It also recognises the necessity for a comprehensive psychosocial support service that spans acute hospitals, primary care and the community and voluntary sectors. The national cancer control programme has also developed NCCP Best Practice Guidance for Community Cancer Support Centres to ensure a seamless transition in support between hospitals and the community. This set of guidelines will help to form the foundations on which we can continue to grow and enhance the services offered by cancer support centres across the country. The Cancer Patient Advisory Committee was established in 2019 and meets quarterly. This committee builds on the work of the Cancer Patient Forum and facilitates patient input into the oversight of the implementation of the national cancer strategy. I welcome this opportunity to discuss funding for cancer support centres and encourage Circle of Friends Cancer Support Centre to engage with the HSE locally on any funding applications or concerns it has. It is evident that people living with and beyond cancer benefit from psychosocial supports, and cancer support centres across Ireland are providing such an important service to those who use and need it. It is important to have supports in one's own locality where possible. Could the Deputy ask the organisation to engage locally? I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and make sure the centre's funding is considered. I am hopeful regarding budget funding considering the centre's work this year to support 1,200 people through their cancer journey.

I do not have to say that she recognises what the cancer centres around the country do. The centre set up in Tipperary town and its work are an example to any cancer support group. The centre expects its number of users to double in 2023. I acknowledge that the door is open for consultation with the HSE and that the Minister of State will use her influence to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. When making my opening remarks, I made a point on funding certainty. An organisation like the centre in question cannot wait until December each year to see whether it will get funding for the next calendar year. There needs to be certainty about its funding stream. It got funding from the national lottery in the past. Obviously, there will always be fundraising. That will not be an issue for the centre as there is a great community spirit. The centre was founded by cancer survivors, who comprise its hub. The first time I went to the centre, which was when it was operating out of what was virtually a derelict building, I met a young lady who, thankfully, is still at the hub of the centre, has survived cancer and is in good health. She has always been a driving force behind the centre. There are many cancer survivors. People diagnosed with cancer should have someone to talk to about financial issues and problems they may have as a result of their illness. Mental issues also arise. There are so many obstacles to overcome and hills to climb when people get the dreaded news that they have been diagnosed with cancer. However, the centre is playing a pivotal role in supporting those diagnosed with cancer. The Minister of State has committed to doing her best to ensure funding is secured for the centre.

We are all familiar with similar organisations in our constituencies. Waterford city has Solas Cancer Support Centre. It is such an important place. I know how important cancer support centres are. They are key in providing psycho-oncology and psychosocial support, and it is important that the development of dedicated survivorship programmes continue in order to enable patients to maximise their quality of life. The important work of the centres cannot be underestimated. The Deputy has said Circle of Friends has had about 1,200 referrals this year and expects this number to double. Since Covid, there has been pent-up demand from people dealing with cancer diagnoses. Once again, on behalf of the Minister, I welcome the opportunity to discuss funding for cancer support centres. I encourage Circle of Friends Cancer Support Centre to engage fully with the HSE in the funding application process. I compliment the staff and volunteers at the centre and thank the Deputy for raising the issue.

I intend to return to some of the issues that have been raised in the media, particularly in relation to the change in the narrative of a teacher shortage crisis to a focus, purposely I believe, on career breaks, which are now being discussed. I believe that was a tactic on the part of the Department and I will challenge it in my contribution. This teacher recruitment and retention crisis in our schools did not happen overnight. It has been more than a decade in the making and it is the result of flawed policy decisions by successive Governments. Even before the pandemic and the cost-of-living squeeze that followed, the seeds were already sown for the serious staff shortages we are now seeing in our schools. The introduction of a lower salary scale for new entrants to the profession in 2010 probably marked the start of the decline. The situation was worsened a few years later when it became more difficult and exorbitantly expensive to qualify as a teacher. Our schools are paying a high price for these short-sighted decisions. The figures are grim. A recent Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, survey found that 91% of post-primary schools experienced recruitment difficulties in the past six months, while 61% reported problems with teacher retention. Almost two thirds of primary schools in Dublin are short-staffed, with Wicklow and Kildare facing similar issues. There are slim pickings for schools that turn to teacher supply panels to deal with staff absences, with 62% of posts vacant in Dublin and 10% vacant outside the capital. This is putting principals under severe pressure and impacting the ability of schools to meet the day-to-day educational needs of their students. It is an outrage that children with additional needs are losing valuable tuition hours because of the recruitment crisis. We are failing those who most need our support. A recent survey by the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, found that 83% of schools have had no option but to redeploy special education teachers to plug the gaps in mainstream classes. The Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, recently ruled out the reintroduction of the banked hours system that operated during Covid for pupils with special needs. This would result in the restoration of any lost tuition time later in the school year. Banked hours should only be used as a last resort, but they should be reinstated as a minimum stopgap measure. Children with additional needs must be shielded from the teacher recruitment crisis so they can reach their full potential within our education system. They are the ones most at risk of regressing, both socially and academically, if they lose vital in-class learning supports. Given the reality in our schools, it is the height of hypocrisy for the Government to state that special education teachers should not be used as substitutes in mainstream classes. Senior Ministers are so out of touch that they deny this is even an issue. I refer to an interview the Minister of State did recently with RTÉ, in which she stated: "I’ve always made it very clear in my capacity as Minister for special education that no special education teacher, or SNA, should be used other than the purpose for which they were assigned." Let me tell the Minister of State that this is exactly what is happening in 83% of our schools, according to a recent survey. The fact that the Minister of State with special responsibility for this area does not even recognise the existence of this crisis is a serious concern to me and the families who have contacted our offices. Recruitment issues are leading to greater inequalities in our education system. One grind school has reported a 100% increase in demand for its courses across a range of subjects, which it attributes to teacher shortages. This has created a situation where students from wealthier backgrounds will have an academic advantage when it comes to State examinations and higher education options. While this has forever been the case, it is certainly being exacerbated under this Government. Some schools have had to drop subjects from the curriculum due to the lack of qualified teachers, while many substitutes are merely taking up supervisory roles in the classrooms. This will potentially affect students’ future careers and college choices. This week, a principal in Dublin was forced to appeal for substitute teachers on social media, warning that schools were at breaking point due to staff shortages. Taking to Twitter to appeal for teachers - that is what we have in this country. I have heard first-hand testimonies from principals about the devastating impact this crisis is having on their schools. As a starting point, the Social Democrats are seeking the establishment of an emergency teacher supply task force, with the involvement of all stakeholders - teachers, principals and trade unions. It is vital that teachers, school principals and union representatives have their voices heard as part of any proposed solutions. We are asking the Minister to work with higher education institutes to increase the numbers of third- and fourth-year student teachers and master’s students engaging in substitution work. We also believe that teachers in training should be paid for their work in placement schools. Barriers to taking up a career in teaching, including financial and academic ones, must be removed if we are to incentivise people to take up teaching. We have proposed a review of the professional master of education, PME, which was increased from one to two years in 2014, with the longer duration leading to significant additional costs. A recent study found that more than 40% of students participating in the PME are reliant on parents or partners for funding. This puts huge pressure on family finances and can cause high levels of financial stress. Since the PME was expanded, it now costs €12,500 to complete the two-year course. This compares with €5,000 for the one-year master’s course just up the road in Belfast.  A lack of affordable accommodation, particularly in Dublin where monthly rents now average almost €2,300 a month, has been identified as a major disincentive to teachers taking up temporary posts. The underlying causes of the housing crisis must be addressed in tandem with measures to increase the supply of qualified teachers. Steps to increase housing supply will be key. My colleague, Deputy Cian O’Callaghan, will speak to these shortly. Increasing supply can be achieved by regulating short-term letting platforms, such as Airbnb, thereby potentially returning properties to the long-term rental market. A punitive 10% tax on vacant homes would also increase supply, along with the acceleration of affordable purchase and cost-rental housing schemes. It is completely unreasonable to ask a teacher to move to a new location if he or she does not have a job or financial security.  The motion calls for permanent, full-time positions to be given to teachers upon their initial appointment and for the elimination of the outrageously long delays for those re-registering with the Teaching Council. Ireland’s teaching workforce is not representative of wider Irish society, with people from working class and minority backgrounds taking up few posts across the country. To this end, we are calling for the introduction of funded scholarships for excellent candidates from minority backgrounds to allow them to pursue primary school teaching qualifications. There are no quick-fix solutions to the teacher recruitment crisis. It will require systemic change and leadership, which has been lacking to date from this Government and the two preceding Governments. Before my colleagues address some of the specifics of this crisis, I remind the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, that this system is broken and verging on collapse. The list of actions they have often reeled off as solutions for the media are ineffective. We have been watching our schools slide deeper into turmoil under their watch. These issues must be tackled as a matter of urgency. We have no time to waste. Urgency was the reason we tabled this motion. It is no coincidence that many of the proposals in the motion, which we submitted last week, are now being taken up according to media reports, for example, in respect of short-term lets.  Yesterday's announcement that career breaks are to be taken off the agenda was like a sledgehammer for the teaching profession. Let us be very clear. We are asking for solutions to address the problems as they exist today. There are 2,000 teachers on career breaks. This proposal will not bring them back into the profession or get teacher into classrooms to alleviate the crisis being experienced. What it has done, very conveniently for this Government, is change the narrative. It is no longer about the Government’s failure or the fact that the cost of living and cost of housing crises, which have been expedited under this Government, are the reason this is happening.It was a cruel and targeted measure and one that will increase the absence of morale among the teaching profession. There were solutions to this crisis. We could look at the prohibitive cost of €12,500 for a person taking on a master's degree. All of these were solutions that could have been implemented but instead this Department has gone to the lowest hanging fruit and done what it has always done, which is to attack the teachers rather than to work with them. What will we do to incentivise people into the profession? What will we do to encourage people to come back? I know people who went into teaching as a vocation and a passion but they simply cannot afford to live in our cities. That is at the root of this crisis and it is at the root of the failure of this Government, the one before that and the one before that. It is not about career breaks but about the Government's failure.

These children have already been waiting for four years for assessments of need, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and now the last plank they have to lean on - their support teachers - is being taken away or reduced. When permanent posts cannot be filled or a substitute teacher cannot be found, support teachers are filling the gap, meaning the most vulnerable children in the education system are the first to suffer because of staff shortages. They are not getting the additional support they need and their development and education suffers for it. You only get one childhood and these children are already playing catch-up. When a teacher or a substitute teacher cannot be found, what happens in reality? That class of students is split into groups of three or four and they are given worksheets and landed into the back of other classrooms throughout the school. The best-case scenario for those children is that they are kept busy for the day but they learn nothing. The worst-case scenario is that a child with special education needs, such as a child who is neurodivergent, will struggle. Not only do they lose the usual support of their regular teacher but they also lose their familiar environment, their classmates and whatever special accommodations are made for them in their usual classroom. There is no point in the Taoiseach and other Ministers saying we will not allow that to happen; it is happening and it is happening now. Páiric Clerkin, CEO of the Irish Primary Principals Network, has stated:We are at crisis point. The situation is critical in Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare.The cost of living is so high that permanent substitute teacher posts cannot be filled. It used to be the case that teachers would come to the greater Dublin area from the country and manage. There was always a higher cost of living in the capital but it was manageable up to now. That is not the case anymore and people just cannot make that work. People, entirely fairly, would rather stay at home in rural counties and stick it out through the years on a panel and wait for a permanent position because one will come up eventually. In the meantime, they get much higher value from their pay than if they moved to Dublin, Kildare or Wicklow while they wait for a permanent post. What is the Government's solution to make teaching in Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare attractive? It is to ban career breaks. This is diverting attention, which I agree with my colleague on, and it will not produce a solution. Career breaks have long been a feature which draw people into this profession. These are well-qualified and excellent professionals who are attracted to the flexibility that allows them to take time off to have a family, to do a degree or, unfortunately, in some cases to move abroad to save up for a deposit because it is impossible here with the price of rent. The Government is considering taking that away. In what world does that incentivise people to come back to teach? The solution to the staffing crisis is never to strip away the terms and conditions staff enjoy. The terms and conditions for teachers who are not on a permanent contract are already on the floor, and the Minister of State must know that. They are not paid over holiday periods and they are paid the bare minimum of sick pay, for example. It may have the opposite effect and it may well be the final straw that encourages people to leave the profession entirely. Because people are leaving the profession, retention is a huge issue. It is common to hear of principals leaving the profession, which I never heard of before. That would have been one of the sought-after positions but because the job has become increasingly impossible, principals are leaving. We have to make teaching a more stable and attractive profession but we cannot blame teachers for the problem, which has basically been created by successive Governments. The shortage of teachers, nurses and other key staff is a symptom of a wider problem, namely the unaffordability and unavailability of housing, which is at the heart of so much of this. Unless that is rectified we will not get a solution to this that is sustainable into the future.

Even then, we were finding it difficult to hire teachers. Even though it was a growing and good new school that was being built, it was so difficult. The reasons were accommodation and rental issues. If we fast-forward to today, we are at a crisis point with this issue. This is not something that has happened recently; it has been building for many years. My constituency of Wicklow is being particularly impacted as one of the worst affected by this crisis. The Irish Primary Principals Network, in its recent survey, identified that 100% of schools in County Wicklow have had difficulties in hiring substitute teachers. Some 50% of schools in the county do not have their full allocation of teachers. Incredibly, some 96% of the schools have had to resort to redeploying their special education teachers, which is not something any principal would do lightly. I have spoken to people in these schools in recent weeks because I could see that this issue is building and I knew that we were having this debate in the Dáil today. I was surprised at the level of interaction I had from the schools within my constituency. I had a huge number of responses to it and they were all saying the same thing. It painted a stark picture of the conditions that principals, teachers and students are facing. Principals tell me that every morning when they go into school, they are sick with worry about what phone call will come in and who will ring in sick. We have teachers who, even though they are sick, are going into school to teach because they do not want to let their classrooms, students or colleagues down. If we have learned anything in recent years, it is that when we are sick we need to stay at home. This is putting enormous pressure on our schools. One of the schools in Wicklow told me they were down one third of their teaching staff on a number of occasions in recent months. No principal can manage that situation. It is not just the principals and teachers who are being impacted by this; it is also having a severe impact on children. For many children their schools are turning from an education facility into a supervision facility if their teachers are not available, particularly for those children who have additional needs, and those children are being left behind again. They were left behind during Covid and they are still trying to make up that time and here, yet again, the Department of Education is leaving them behind because this is not the fault of principals. I know the Minister of State will say, as the Taoiseach said to me recently in the Dáil, that this should never happen and that no special education teacher should be redeployed but the reality is that it is happening and that principals are having to make that decision. I would be interested to hear from the Minister of State what she says to principals if it is a case of redeploying a special education teacher or sending 30 children home. What do they do? The Department is putting them in an impossible situation due to its lack of planning on this issue. It is disgraceful that the supports that special education teachers provide are seen as discretionary by this Government because it knows they are the solution to this crisis that principals are having to deploy. In preparation for this debate I had a look at the Department's website, where it talks about its values.One is that the Department values its "staff and all those who work in schools and in other education settings." It claims to value its students and places "the student at the centre of education strategy and policy development." It is clear that those values are not being met. The motion that we in the Social Democrats are bringing forward is a practical one based on finding solutions for this issue. We are not seeking to take political swipes. We want to work with the Government because we know it is a difficult situation. I hope the recommendations that have been made in this motion will be taken on board and that the Government will take them seriously to find solutions to the problems that have been identified. Speaking on behalf of the Social Democrats, if the Government were to take those solutions on board, we would support the Minister of State in that and work with her constructively to see them implemented. There are no winners in all this; just children losing out on time in the classroom with the resources they need and staff left spinning trying to keep everything going as best they can. We can all agree that cannot be anyone's idea of good enough.

The Minister, Deputy Foley, wanted to be here this morning to respond in person to the motion and listen to all the voices that will contribute to this important debate. Regrettably, she is present in her capacity as Minister for Education at the OECD ministerial conference taking place in Paris involving 38 members of the OECD and is thus unable to attend. She continues to work intensively with officials and stakeholders on this issue, however. This is, of course, a priority area of action for the Department given the importance of ensuring that every child's experience in school is positive and that they have available to them qualified, engaged and supportive teachers to support them in their learning. We look forward to continuing work with key stakeholders in this regard. The Department of Education runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers. Despite this work, it is acknowledged that problems persist when it comes to sourcing teachers. The nature of the challenges is different but also shared to some extent across the two sectors. At primary level, the vast majority of teaching posts are filled and challenges are more likely to arise in respect of securing substitute cover. Where challenges arise at post-primary level, it is more likely in respect of specific subject areas. A challenge shared across primary and post-primary when it comes to vacancies are the wider societal challenges associated with the cost of living and availability of housing that every sector is facing, which has been mentioned. As Deputies know, the Government is investing hugely in this area through its Housing for All plan. In budget 2023, a package of €6.3 billion was announced, which included a commitment of €1.3 billion towards more affordable housing. A vacant homes tax is also committed to and legislation providing for its introduction is due to be enacted before the end of the year. The Government also introduced the first ever stand-alone legislation to support the provision of more affordable housing via the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which provides for the now-established first home scheme, the local authority-led affordable purchase scheme and which introduced a new form of tenure in cost rental. Both affordable purchase and cost-rental schemes are now delivering new homes and funding is in place to deliver 28,000 homes under these schemes in the period to 2026. While some have spoken of the current challenge as a recruitment and retention problem, the evidence does not support this. The number of teachers registered with the Teaching Council has more than doubled to more than 116,000 teachers since its establishment in 2006. Demand at undergraduate level remains high and there was increased interest among CAO applicants for post-primary teaching programmes in 2022. Interest in the Professional Master of Education programmes also remains high. The changes made to the programmes have focused on improving the quality of teaching in our schools, which is central to the educational outcomes of our children. The professional master of education is also to be included in a longitudinal review of teacher education, which is a joint initiative of the Department and the Teaching Council. In terms of employment arrangements, it should also be remembered that teachers can be recruited on a permanent basis once the school or education and training board, ETB, is within its authorised allocation of teaching posts and the criteria set by the Department for filling of teaching posts are complied with. A number of measures and actions have been taken to assist in meeting the teacher supply challenges. First, approximately 3,500 newly-qualified teachers have had their registrations finalised by the Teaching Council to date in 2022. The number of newly-qualified primary school teachers qualifying in recent years has remained steady despite the reduction in demographics in the sector now taking place. The Teaching Council made regulations allowing for the registration of third and fourth year undergraduate initial teacher education students under a new registration route. This school year sees the full impact of this measure. So far, more than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration to date with approximately 1,250 registered at this time. Significant additional posts have also been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue. For 2022-23, there are 151 supply panels nationally, with an allocation of 610 posts covering 2,842 schools. Some 450 teachers have been appointed to these posts. Launched in 2019, Sub Seeker is a central portal for short-term substitute vacancies, which was jointly developed by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, in accordance with the Department of Education's teacher supply action plan. The portal matches available primary and post-primary teachers with short-term substitute vacancies. More than 11,800 teachers have registered with Sub Seeker to date. On a temporary basis for the 2022-23 school year, job-sharing teachers may be employed to work as substitutes during the period they are rostered off-duty. The limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has also been temporarily suspended for the 2022-23 school year. A pension abatement waiver for retired teachers returning to teach for up to 50 days is available in each of the three calendar years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Department has put in place a scheme for the 2022-23 school year to allow post-primary teachers to teach in their subject area over the usual limit of 22 hours per week, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Turasabhaile is a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals that matches registered teachers resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools in Ireland. Free upskilling programmes are now available for post-primary registered teachers to upskill in subjects where teacher supply is tight such as in mathematics, Spanish and physics. These commenced in January 2021. Approximately 170 places were provided in the first intake across the three programmes with an increase in places to 310 for the class graduating in 2023. A new course for teachers to upskill in Irish will commence in 2023. Higher education institutions have developed new four-year initial teacher education undergraduate programmes in a number of post-primary priority subject areas including Irish, mathematics, computer science and modern foreign languages. These new programmes mean that more student teachers can qualify to be post-primary teachers in four years instead of six and at much lower cost than the Professional Master of Education route. Following on from the Ward report, the qualification period for contracts of indefinite duration was reduced from three years to two years. The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. In spite of the actions taken, the Government accepts that challenges remain and that further action is needed. The Minister, Deputy Foley, has updated the Government in respect of a range of actions that are being progressed, which I will set out. The Department is in contact with some initial teacher education providers, including Hibernia College, with a view to maximising the availability of their Professional Master of Education students to undertake substitution work for the remainder of the school year. The teacher supply panels at primary level are now being reviewed to evaluate their usage and effectiveness for the next school year. This may lead to some modification from the current approach in terms of how panels are used and how recruitment for the panels operates. It is intended to consider, on a temporary basis and following engagement with the education partners, arrangements for co-operating teachers to allow them to substitute in other classes while a student teacher is on placement in their class. The potential to suspend or amend on a temporary basis non-statutory leave arrangements, which have the effect of creating demand on substitution in schools, is also under consideration by the Department. A mechanism is being advanced to incentivise and support schools employing a teacher on less than full hours to use the teacher sharing scheme that has been developed. Shortly, the Irish Primary Principals' Network is expected to launch its new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions.The portal is designed to match available teachers with vacancies in a user-friendly manner and provide an efficient application and recruitment process for both teachers and schools. The Department's recent report on developing a post-primary subject teacher demand and supply model for Ireland will provide a basis for further consultation with education stakeholders. It is planned to hold a workshop on this in the near future. Plans to attract students from more diverse backgrounds into teaching as a profession are also being developed. There have been calls for union representation on the existing teacher supply structures and the establishment of an emergency task force. The current set of structures supporting the teacher supply work will be reviewed so their effectiveness can be maintained and enhanced, having regard to the current phase of the work. The Department of Education will augment the existing upskilling programmes in priority subject areas, both in terms of increasing participating numbers where needed and broadening them to include other subject areas with an identified supply shortfall. The Teaching Council is being asked to examine its current registration process for those qualified outside the State and to consider the temporary reintroduction of facilitating UK-trained teachers undertaking their induction in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I want to say something specifically on the use of special education resources by schools, which has been raised by some Deputies this morning. The use of banked SET hours was an exceptional measure during the Covid-19 impact on schools. It was an urgent measure of last resort, following public health advice, and was not intended to be available on an ongoing basis due to the potential to impact negatively on students with special educational needs. Classes could not be split then but they can now.

Based on what she said, there is a lack of a sense of urgency on this. There is a sense of complacency. I will talk about the housing aspect of this issue and how this is affecting the shortage and the crisis we have in teaching staff. It is not just affecting those in the education sector but key workers in healthcare and across our society. I will say one thing about the Minister of State's comments with regard to housing. People, teachers and other key workers who need housing need somewhere affordable to live. They cannot live in Government housing targets or plans. They need affordable homes to live in. We keep hearing about the Government's plans to do this or that but what is needed are actual homes, that are affordable, for people move into and live in. It is almost three years now since the general election and since this Government came into office. The time for talking about things has passed. The Government saying it is going to do X, Y and Z in the future is not good enough. We need action on this now. I am constantly talking to people who are affected by this crisis. The housing crisis is impacting on schools and education in three particular ways. It is a direct cause of this shortage in teachers and staff. It has impacted heavily in the classroom on children's development and education, especially children who have become homeless. When there is a child or several children in the classroom who are living in emergency accommodation, it is massively disruptive to their education. That obviously has an effect on the entire class and their well-being. I am constantly talking to parents who say the great work they have done, with the support of teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and school staff, to get their child through learning difficulties and challenges is ripped to shreds when they are evicted into emergency accommodation away from their local communities.  Another effect of this that we have not talked about yet is that teachers are ending up having to commute very long distances to get to work and to the classroom. They are arriving exhausted. They are not getting the same time with their families that they should be. Any teacher, especially people who have been teaching for the last ten or 15 years, will tell you about the transformation in the challenges they face as teachers over that time. They have to do a huge amount now. They have to meet challenges outside of the formal education part of their role. They support their students and give extra support to students dealing with a variety of challenges, including mental health challenges and all the other challenges young people are facing now. With all those extra challenges being put on teachers, along with the housing challenges and the fact they might be commuting longer and longer distances from other counties, they are arriving exhausted. For the welfare of our students and our children in schools, we need their teachers and staff to be able to give everything to their roles. By taking away from that and not managing things like the housing disaster, it is impacting on the welfare of our children in schools. That will have long-term effects on us as a country and as a society. As I said, this is not just something that affects teachers. We are seeing these effects in healthcare and across the board. Let us look at the Government's delivery on housing and what has happened since this Government took office. Rents have reached record levels, house prices have reached record levels and the number of people living in homeless emergency accommodation has reached record levels under this Government. The number of young people in their 20s and 30s living in their childhood bedrooms has reached record levels. I have lost count of the number of teachers I have met in my constituency who feel they are doing everything right in terms of working hard in their jobs and yet they are in their late 20s or early 30s and they have had to return home to their childhood bedrooms. That is ripping up the social contract for those teachers who are putting everything into their work but want to be able to build an independent life for themselves. That is not too much for anyone to expect. Incredibly, despite all of us knowing all these things, this Government is somehow leaving unspent hundreds of millions of euro that were allocated to be spent on housing this year, which would help to alleviate some of the pressures teachers, schools and principals are facing. The fiscal monitor published by the Government a few days ago shows that at the end of November, over €700 million that was meant to be spent by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage so far this year had not been spent. This Government brought in Revised Estimates on housing this year. You would think, in this crisis, that such Estimates would involve hundreds of millions of euro of additional spending in housing to really get to grips with this disaster. Somehow, they did not involve additional spending but actually reallocated €337 million, which had been allocated to be spent on building much-needed new build local authority homes. That would take some of the pressure off the housing disaster we have, but instead that money was reallocated for other purposes and other headings, including €100 million to pay down local authority loans, instead of building those much-needed homes. Given the level of the disaster in housing and the impact it is having on our schools and on teachers, it is very hard to understand why this Government is not spending hundreds of millions of euro that it allocated to meet its targets in these areas. We have not had any satisfactory explanation from the Government as to why, in the middle of this disaster, that is what it is doing. A number of things can be done immediately by the Government if it is serious about the housing disaster. Yesterday my colleague Deputy Shortall raised the tax on vacant homes with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. It has not been introduced yet, but it has been set at a miserly and ineffective 0.3%. The Government's projections in this regard show that the new tax will have a minimal impact on getting vacant homes back into use. According to the census figures, there are somewhere in the region of 160,000 vacant homes around the country, many of which could be brought back into use. If there was an effective tax put on them, tens of thousands of homes could be brought back into use and teachers and other workers would be able to avail of them. If the Government was serious about this crisis and disaster, it would do that, and do so immediately, rather than bringing in an ineffective measure it knows is designed to fail.We keep on hearing from the Government and from different Ministers that the latest thing it will do to address this housing disaster will be to throw tax incentives at developers. Almost three years since the election, having failed to meet all its targets on housing in terms of affordable homes, cost rental homes and the delivery of social homes, it is now grasping at this and throwing even more incentives at developers. Instead of doing that, the Government should clearly be using the resources it has to ensure, through direct-building, that we get the affordable purchase, rental and social homes that are needed to take pressures off schools and teachers. Instead, the latest idea is to throw more incentives at developers and hope for the best, the latest attempt to resuscitate the build-to-rent sector and the investment funds, where that level of funding is now in difficulty, rather than looking at direct-build measures that would alleviate this crisis. I do not think the scale of this crisis and how it is affecting schools, children or teachers in schools, is understood by this Government. There are measures the Government could be taking right now to alleviate the housing disaster element of this and we just do not see it doing that. We do not see it taking this seriously and we do not see the kind of urgent action needed from the Government to ensure our children in our schools get the best possible education and the best possible support from their teaching staff.

I commend the Social Democrats on this very well put together and timely motion. It contains a number of suggestions which I urge the Minister to take on board. The current crisis in our schools is quite profound. It exists absolutely everywhere but is most severe in the big cities and on the east coast. Some 60% of places on the substitute panels in Dublin are vacant. There are occasions when if three teachers are out, schools are only able to find one substitute. I know St. James's Primary School found itself in this situation in late November. Similarly, it is a base school for a substitute panel and advertised for places on that panel seven times and did not find somebody to take up the position. It is very clear this is taking up an enormous amount of time from principals and puts pressure on them, but more importantly it is having a huge adverse impact on the education our children are getting. As has been acknowledged, there are implications for children with special educational needs. It also means schools are having to remove subjects from the curriculum - I know that is the case in the instance of Coolmine Community School in Dublin. It means classes are being put together and in different combinations and it is hugely adversely affecting children's ability to learn. Tá sé sin dhá uaire níos measa do scoileanna atá ag feidhmiú trí mheán na Gaolainne. Bhí easpa múinteoirí ann cheana féin do go leor ábhar ag an dara leibhéal sna Gaelcholáistí agus tá an fhadhb níos measa fós sna scoileanna sin. I have debated this with the Minister and the Minister of State a number of times over the past couple of weeks and I have acknowledged that some of the actions taken, such as, for example, allowing retired teachers to do more substitutions, were welcome. This latest proposal is quite remarkable. I am trying to imagine the meeting in the Department of Education and how deep it had to dig into the bowels of the Department to find the so-called solution it could somehow pin on the trade unions and put the Department on the opposite side. Could it look at permanent contracts at any time throughout the year? No, it was decided that was not going to work. Could it offer post-primary teachers more full-time contracts? No, that would not work either. Could it offer teachers coming back from England the option to complete their training or initial period here, such as happened during Covid-19? No, that was not going to work either. The Department would have had to go through 15 or 20 solutions to come up with this one, really rooting down the back of the couch to try to find it. Another issue on top of that is the message this sends to young mothers looking to go into a profession that is primarily female.  I note the Minister cannot be here and I acknowledge there is a very legitimate reason for that. I do not have an issue with that and hope that officials from her Department are carefully listening to this. I also hope officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are listening because the responsibility for this issue lies just as much with that Department as it does with the Department of Education. Undoubtedly, there are many more things that could be done and I have given examples of the kind of things the Department of Education could be doing. However, at the end of the day, we are facing this issue because teachers cannot afford to rent in Dublin or the major cities, they have no hope of putting together a mortgage in the major cities and many of them can barely afford to do so in this country and are looking at the Middle East and Britain. The fact is that the Government is failing so profoundly on the housing crisis. Rents, house prices and the numbers of people in homelessness are at record levels and the one thing the Minister is clinging to, which is the commencements, is down too. By every metric the Government is failing and it is for that reason we are losing teachers to different professions, from the cities and to other countries. This problem is only going to get worse unless the Government gets to grips with this housing crisis. Not only that but it is going to spread to other disciplines, not just in the public sector or in the private sector. More and more, we are going to find a shortage of key, skilled, frontline workers unless the Government finally gets to grips with this and changes course because what it is doing now is not working.

Before I came in, I spoke to the principal of a primary school and she told me that the reality is that they cannot teach children without teachers yet teachers are being exported daily. She told me that without substitute teachers being available, she is constantly having to split classes or as a last report, cancel learning support meaning they cannot make good the gaps left by Covid-19. As a principal in a DEIS school, she and her teachers go above and beyond for the pupils, because they desperately need education. As the Minister of State knows, education in DEIS schools is about much more than just sitting in the classroom and teaching. It is about the whole school experience and is very often the only place where a child will get a hot meal, a listening ear and all of those things. This principal has extremely dedicated teachers who are really committed to their work but they feel like the Department is forcing them to emigrate. The Minister of State says in her contribution that she is looking at the potential to suspend or amend on a temporary basis, non-statutory leave arrangements which have the effect of creating demand on substitution in schools. I say to the Minister of State that suspending careers breaks and attacking the terms and conditions of teachers sends exactly the wrong message. She could look at offering teachers permanent contracts, at full-time contracts or at ensuring the profession of teaching in this State is made more attractive. She could, of course, though this might be a bit wild, just look at building houses and tackling the housing crisis that 12 years of the Minister of State's party in government has created so teachers could have somewhere to live. Having somewhere to live has now become an aspiration for teachers rather than something they can assume will happen. With 60% of posts on the primary substitute panel in Dublin currently vacant, what is the Minister of State's answer? Cutting the rights and entitlements of teachers and attacking their working conditions is not going to work. The Minister of State should use her time in the wrap-up to withdraw that silly proposal.

I very much welcome this motion. It is a very serious issue and in the short time I have, I will mainly focus on the impact it is having on children and their educational opportunities. We get one chance in the school system. Every child is obviously different and it can be very difficult for some children, particularly in the aftermath of Covid-19.It has always frustrated me that after Covid-19 schools went back to a more normal system and children were just expected to slot back in. There was not the recognition that should have been there. Additional resource hours were given in some cases but not all. It is as though that year and a half did not happen. Now we see a situation where children are back into the school system and are trying to catch up. Many children are still trying to catch up on the basics of reading, writing and spelling, depending on the age they were and what class they were in when the lockdowns happened. Homeschooling was a complete disaster and no child benefited from it. After Covid-19 we needed to put a great deal more resources in. What has happened is a serious shortage of teachers and that is having an impact. It is unacceptable that children have different teachers or they might have free classes. Kids love the excitement of going to school and having no classes for a day but in the long term that is not going to benefit them. It is totally unfair to the teachers who are doing their best and, in some circumstances, coming in when they are sick and they know they should be out. They are doing their best because they do not want to let the students down. Teachers are being driven out of our cities by the cost of housing and the inability to find housing. To say it is a mess is an understatement. I agree with my colleagues who said the Government's proposal of the Government is ridiculous. It is a divide and conquer mentality rather than examining the solutions at which we should look in regard to housing and ensuring we have adequate teaching staff.

We have a severe crisis in teacher supply at present in both primary and post-primary schools, primarily caused by the cost and availability of housing throughout the country, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. It is greatly exacerbated by the current cost-of-living crisis. Teachers, particularly lower-paid younger teachers, cannot afford the rental costs and have little prospect of being able to manage a mortgage in the big urban centres. While the cost and availability of housing and the cost-of-living crisis are the primary factors, they are not the only problems that led to this crisis. There has been, and continues to be, a lack of planning in the recruitment and retention of teachers going back years. I taught in secondary school and for years we could not get Irish teachers; then we could not get French teachers; and then we could not get mathematics teachers. There has been an issue for a number of years in certain subject areas at second level. There is a pattern to this lack of preparedness across services that are in crisis, including teachers, housing and the health service. It is traced back to inadequate and short-sighted Government policy. At post-primary level in particular, it is about the creation of additional positions. Too many teachers are on insecure, temporary contracts and are underemployed. That is the key part of addressing the supply issue at this level. Delays in registration with the Teaching Council particularly affect teachers who qualified abroad and could be easily addressed and rectified. The cost of the professional master of education, PME, is excessive and reducing that needs to be looked at as well. The Government could remove the October and November cut-offs for permanent contracts so that teachers coming home for Christmas or from abroad would have the opportunity to get full-time contracts that would keep them here. As it stands, they have to apply for a temporary contract, not be paid over the summer and then take their chances for the next year. Cuts to middle management and posts with responsibility imposed in 2009 have not been fully restored. It is crucial to boost promotional prospects within the teaching profession to encourage more people to become teachers. More full-time contracts, promotional opportunities and competitive salaries are needed. More houses also need to be built as well to address the housing shortage. I am concerned about special education teachers being removed and being put in to manage mainstream classes. Children with special needs are then affected most.

Rents continue to increase. We saw the astounding figures yesterday relating to how much they have increased since 2010. It comes as no surprise that people are finding it impossible to live in the cities. Many have to commute further and further. The lessons we learned from Covid-19 about having a work-life balance have been knocked on the head. The reality for many teachers is that insecure, temporary contracts have a massive impact. We have all seen it in our families and among our friends. People have to move from one end of the country to the other end to try to find a place to work. This is not a new issue. It is not just affecting our cities; it affects our offshore islands as well. There used to an allowance of more than €2,000 for teachers living on our offshore islands who might only get a few hours a week in a particular school. They used to get a small allowance to move there or to help them with the commute, which is obviously a difficult commute. However, that allowance was taken away. I have raised this issue previously and it needs to be examined. Another issue I feel strongly about is that some islands, such as Inishbofin, do not have a secondary school. I have been trying to raise this issue in the Chamber for some time. Children who are leaving primary school have to move onto the mainland. Tá mé théis é seo a ardú go rímhinic ach tá sé fíorthábhachtach go dtiocfadh an liúntas ar ais a bhíodh ag múinteoirí i dtaca dul chuig na hoileáin amach ón gcósta. Tuigimid cé chomh deacair is atá sé do na scoileanna ar na hoileáin daoine a earcú mar gheall go bhfuil costas sa bhreis ann chun bogadh amach go dtí na hoileáin nó chun dul amach i gcomhair cúpla uair in aghaidh na seachtaine. Caithfear breathnú air sin. Tagraím don stuif mar gheall ar stop a chur le career breaks; seafóid iomlán atá ann.

The purpose was to find out directly from the schools the challenges they face. We met representatives of approximately 25 schools. The schools have several common issues, one of which is the shortage of teachers. There is a problem in recruiting and retaining teachers throughout the State but it is particularly stark in Dublin. The cost of living in Dublin means it is unsustainable for teachers to work in our city and county. The Government’s disastrous record on housing has pushed house prices and rents through the roof. Figures released this week show that rents have increased by 82% in 12 years. It is no coincidence that Fine Gael has been in government and in charge of housing for those years. How can any profession maintain staffing levels while facing such pressures? School principals told me that they simply cannot attract teachers to work in Dublin as the cost of living is lower back home. Many teachers are returning to live as adults in their family home. Emigration is also attracting teachers. I refer to the remark of the outgoing Tánaiste or is he the incoming Taoiseach? I get lost with what is going on at the moment; it is like a weird version of Lanigan’s Ball - “I step out so he can step in again.” His remark that the grass is not greener flies in the face of teachers who are making informed decisions to emigrate to make a new life for themselves. We have been inundated in my area with concerned parents contacting our offices worried they will not have a school place for their children in September. Years of underinvestment by successive governments have led to a crisis in our education system. Years of delays, extensions and new builds have not allowed schools to grow in line with the population growth in their surrounding area. Dublin Mid-West is one of the fastest-growing areas in Ireland and school places have not kept up with demand. Each school has its own enrolment policy that is independent, and rightly so, and overseen by its board of management. Some boards have told me they had to tighten their entry criteria as the demand simply outweighs supply. As with all aspects of society, be it housing, health, mental health, the Government has failed the people in education.

I wish to thank the Social Democrats. The Minister must listen to the principals and teachers who are on the front line. They have the answers and so far the INTO has deplored her lack of engagement and consultation on potential changes to members' terms and conditions. The TUI said that her proposals would make the profession less attractive and, ultimately, worsen the teacher recruitment and teaching crisis. It also criticised the lack of consultation.A recent TUI survey found that 91% of secondary schools experienced teacher recruitment difficulties in the past six months while 61% experienced teacher retention difficulties. The system of banked hours that operated in schools at the height of the Covid pandemic needs to be reinstated immediately. Kildare is one of the worst affected areas. In an IPPN survey, 63% of respondents said they did not have access to a fully staffed supply panel, 92% have ongoing challenges in recruiting substitute teachers and 100% have had to redeploy a special education teacher to cover a mainstream class. Our most vulnerable children are suffering. Shortages at secondary level are more widespread and are severe in particular subjects. The Government failure to plan ahead is the cause of this crisis and the root cause, as many other Deputies have said, is the cost of living and housing. I hope the Minister of State is listening. The principals and teachers who are on the front line have answers and they need to be looked at. A new secondary school will open in Monasterevin in the next year but it will be beyond capacity on the day it opens. That is simply not good enough. Things need to change and we need action.

I was speaking to somebody in the education sphere last week. Our conversation turned to teacher shortages and the person said to me that whatever those in government come up with, we can be sure their plan will put the blame on teachers. Sure enough, as if by magic, just as they are scrambling around to try to find answers to come up with some sort of a response to the excellent motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gary Gannon, and the Social Democrats, they have done it again. It reminds me of the time during the pandemic when the schools were closed because that was the medical advice, and there was controversy over how we could reopen schools. Despite the fact that the Government was not listening to school leaders, was not prioritising air filtration systems in schools, was not investing in schools and was not providing support for teachers, at the end of the day, when it came down to it, what the Government wanted the parents’ conversations at dinner tables and on WhatsApp groups to be about was that this was not really about Government inaction or about failures of Government, and was not even about the virus, it was about teachers. Then, when it came to the spectacular failure of the Government to find school places last September for children with additional needs, despite the fact it had to ram through emergency legislation at the end of June and it was about Government inaction in that space, what it also managed to do as a Government was to blame individual schools, and teachers and principals in those schools, with one Minister naming four schools. Again, what they were hoping would be said on the WhatsApp groups, at the school gates and at dinner tables was that it was not about Government inaction and it was about these teachers and principals, and, in fact, it was about those four individual schools that were named by that Minister. Again, it was the teachers' fault. Then, today, in spectacular fashion, when every teacher, principal and SNA we speak to refers to the housing crisis when it comes to the teacher supply problem, the Minister of State comes in and reads out a 15-page speech, one page of which is about housing. Then, the Government manages through leaks from Cabinet discussions to put the blame on those pesky teachers and their career breaks. Once again, the teacher supply problem is not about Government inaction or about housing, it is about teachers again. What the Government wants to have in all these debates about school reopening during Covid is that it is kind of the teachers’ fault; or regarding lack of places for children with additional needs, again, it is the teachers’ fault; and now, the fact we cannot get teachers is the teachers’ fault. It is unbelievable. I will tell the Minister of State, flatly and plainly, that the only reason the education system has not completely and utterly collapsed is because of the goodwill and the professionalism of the teachers that the Government seems determined to malign, along with SNAs and the wider school community. Let us talk plainly about what the problem is: it is a housing problem. I do not want to have a debate that pits rural against urban Ireland but let us be frank. The Government is allowing Dublin to die on its watch. We cannot get teachers, nurses or gardaí to live in the capital city and to serve it. Our schools are being bled of talent that could teach these children, and the children feel it and know it because it is they are in classrooms without a teacher, or with a substitute teacher, or else they have a succession of teachers. They know there is something wrong. By the way, oftentimes these teachers, if they happen to have a chance to teach, are teaching children who are also affected by the homelessness crisis and the housing crisis, living with their parents in their grandparents’ house. I know of a particular school, with which I have a personal relationship, where I was told the situation has completely changed over the past 12 years and that 24% of the children are now in homelessness. Yet, when the Government has a chance to respond to today's motion, what does it do? It wants those of us in opposition who are talking about teacher supply to have to talk about career breaks, not about housing. It is unbelievable that it has constructed a narrative today where we are talking about career breaks for teachers, not about housing. I feel that the city I love, the city I grew up in, the city I live in and the city I care about, is dying on this Government’s watch fundamentally because we cannot get nurses because they say they cannot live in Dublin. The Tánaiste seems to think that what gardaí need is a gun rather than a gaff. Teachers are being priced out of the city. We need to talk seriously about a Dublin allowance. It is going to get people in the Rural Independent Group very excited when a Deputy stands up and says that. That is fair enough. They have this in London. When they had a teacher shortage issue in London, they recognised that the cost of living issue in the city was serious and because they needed teachers to teach London kids, it was seen as that important, given the particular pressures in London. Let us talk seriously about it here in Dublin as well. Let us talk seriously about providing a standard of living for teachers in Dublin so it should not be an aspiration for someone to be a teacher and to live and work in Dublin. That should not be outside the capacity of a teacher. The State needs to recognise that and introduce a Dublin allowance. That is a much more constructive idea for the Government to toss around the place, rather than having an onslaught once again on teachers' pay and conditions. I swear to God that if any of those in government, whether in Cabinet or on the backbenches, spent five minutes in a school classroom, they would not be able to survive because of the number of skills and competencies they would need. They should back off from the teachers and their terms and conditions, and realise that what they are doing is overseeing a housing crisis that is pushing teachers out of Dublin and affecting the children of the city. It is not good enough and they need to sort it out.

The answer from the Government for that crisis was to get rid of the pay cap of €500,000 so we can pay them millions of euro like they were paid before the banking crisis that we all experienced.This week, we hear about a much more important, severe and impactful crisis in terms of teacher shortages, which is having a significant impact on children across the country, particularly in Dublin. What is the Government's answer? It is to get rid of teachers' career breaks. That tells us everything we need to know about whom the Government represents and whom it does not. It is incredible that we have a crisis that is acknowledged by everybody in the know, one that is caused by terms and conditions for teachers, an inability to recruit and maintain teachers in their positions and the housing crisis. Those are the two key factors that are driving the crisis whereby 91% of school have experienced teacher recruitment difficulties in the past six months and 61% of schools experienced teacher retention difficulties, yet the Government's answer is to suspend career breaks. In advance of this response by the Government, the TUI warned that, "Announcing limited measures yet again in relation to career breaks, job-sharing and the taking of additional hours will do nothing to tackle the significant problems being experienced in schools around the country." Yet here we have it - the Government's answer to teaching not being sustainable for teachers is to take a measure to make the profession less attractive and, ultimately, worsen the teacher recruitment and retention crisis. Meaningful action means tackling the housing crisis. It means introducing rent controls to bring rents down to affordable levels, as well as building social and genuinely affordable homes on a massive scale. It also means addressing the conditions faced by teachers. It means offering them whole-time jobs when they start their careers, unlike the 65% of teachers appointed after 2011 who did not get a contract of full hours upon initial appointment. It means restoring all of the posts immediately, which ensures the smooth running of schools while providing promotional opportunities for teachers which, again, will help to boost retention. The action the Government needs to take is obvious but, instead, it is insisting on blaming teachers for the crisis.

I thank the Social Democrats for tabling the motion. I will take the example of a schoolteacher from Pakistan who teaches in Our Lady of Lourdes National School in Goldenbridge, Dublin 8. It is a DEIS school. Members may be familiar with it. The teacher in question came from Pakistan on a 1G graduate visa, trained here as a special needs teacher and started working in Goldenbridge last January. Her visa is now under application for renewal but there are two different systems in play. One is that the Department of Education told the school it had to advertise the job in a certain manner, and it did so, and Zabaria Peter, the woman in question, got the job. The Department of Justice states the school has to advertise it in a different way, but the Departments will not speak to one another. They do not communicate. I find this in every aspect of this Government. Two sides of the same coin do not deal with one another. This woman is being put out of Goldenbridge school. She is to lose her job having been educated but, more important, the kids are going to lose her. The special needs kids in the school love her, as do their parents and the community. She is doing a brilliant job. This brings me to another issue, which is the messed up attitude to immigration in this country. There is currently a big row going on about immigration in all corners of the country. Let us remember, however, that for all the hysteria in respect of refugees, every single one of them comes with a pair of hands, a brain and a hungry belly. That means they can contribute to this society, as Zabaria is doing, rather than being seen as a burden on it. I visited a refugee camp in Greece during the Syrian war. Most of the adults I met there were highly trained, educated and skilled people who wanted to work in the system - as maths teachers, engineers, builders, medics and all sorts of other things. It is about time we had that conversation in this country, as well as the whole conversation in respect of housing. Those issues are linked. We cannot keep looking at people as though they are a burden or a problem. Everybody has something to contribute to society. The person some people think they hate today could be the bus driver, home builder, schoolteacher or hospital nurse or doctor of tomorrow. I again appeal for the Department of Education to speak to the Department of Justice, which has responsibility for immigration, regarding this woman at Goldenbridge school. It should do the kids and the community a favour and keep her in the job she loves and wants to be in.

Why would a young teacher who is thinking of emigrating after Christmas stick around for a one-year contract? Why would a person who has already emigrated come back for a one-year contract? Teachers coming back to Dublin or Cork will be asked to pay €25,000 a year rent in one city and €20,000 a year in the other. The Government let the market set the price for the pay of chief executive officers of banks. It broke the €500,000 ceiling because bankers were going to London, Paris or Frankfurt for work. It plays a completely different set of rules, however, for teachers and other key workers, such as nurses. They go to Australia or Canada but the Government keeps their pay at levels that do not allow them to live a decent life. To add insult to injury, the Government is trying to put the blame on teachers by attempting to make this a debate about career breaks. It needs to back off on that one. This issue creates real problems for students. Schools that cannot recruit or retain teachers are doubling up on classes. Subjects are being dropped, unqualified teachers are being drafted in to teach classes and principals are shoring up the situation by bringing in special needs assistants to plug the gap. I congratulate the parents and teachers of Coolmine Community School in Dublin West, who are campaigning to highlight these issues and pushing for change. If their example was followed across the country, that would be very positive. If the teacher unions were to campaign and take action on this issue, there would be a high level of public support. There are many things the Government could do. It could bring back the posts of responsibility and pay for them. Opening that up again would be a positive step. Ultimately, this is about permanent posts and affordable housing. The vacancies should not be advertised as temporary posts. Every vacancy should be made a permanent position. If the Government does that, the so-called teacher shortage crisis will quickly come under control. It needs to make the temporary posts permanent and tackle the issue of affordable housing.

This is a massively important issue, one that has been playing on the minds of parents, teachers and students across the country for several years. I am a parent of four young children who are in school. Their school is excellent and does wonderful work in giving the children the skills they will need for the future. However, schools have been struggling significantly and consistently in recent years. Many principals are spending all their time trying to get teachers into the schools and, when they cannot do so, they are spending all their time splitting classes up and distributing them among the rest of the classes in the school. The major difficulty here is that we have a generation of young children who have had the longest and most severe lockdown in Europe in terms of their access to education in schools. Now that they are back, they need extra help and support to catch up on what they have lost in the past two years but that help and support are not available. The results of this will manifest themselves in these children's futures. The lack of proper education in classes across the country currently means they will not reach their potential. A survey carried out by the TUI found that 91% of secondary schools experienced problems in recruiting teachers in the past six months, while 61% of secondary schools had major problems in respect of retention. The survey found that 80% of school leaders are reporting problems finding staff more broadly.Some 55% of principals reported they had significant vacancies in their own schools at the time of the survey, while more than 84% of principals said they experienced situations during the past school year where no teacher applied for advertised posts. We are in a massive crisis regarding this matter. It is absurd that the Government is talking about dealing with this crisis by potentially suspending career breaks for teachers because at the heart of this problem is the fact that the terms and conditions for teachers are not attractive enough at present to bring people into the sector. If the Government deletes one of the key elements of the terms and conditions for teachers, all it will do is make it less attractive for teachers to get involved in education in the future. The terms and conditions for teachers are made up of many different elements, including, obviously, salary and how far that salary goes in paying for the key necessities of life. I will speak to that in a couple of minutes. Those terms and conditions, however, also include the number of students in classes, investment in schools, the quality and conditions that exist in schools, and the pressures teachers are under in schools at present. On the salaries that teachers are currently experiencing, it is an incredible situation that, in real terms, when considering expenditure by a young teacher, teachers' salaries have significantly reduced over the past ten years. A teacher working in the Dublin area at present will pay approximately €1,600 a month for a one-bedroom apartment. That adds up to more than €19,000 a year. Based on the current starting salary of a teacher, that leaves approximately €10,000 to pay for things such as tax, heating, food, transport and anything else a young, professional teacher might have to deal with on a year-to-year basis. The salary the Government is providing, taking account of the housing crisis that exists, is simply not attractive enough to get professionals into the sector. In addition, we are living in a global market so teachers are being employed elsewhere in the world. Their skills are highly valued and, with low employment rates, teachers can go into other sectors of the economy, work there and earn a good living. The crisis the Government allowed to develop in the housing market over the past number of years, which is getting worse, is having the effect that young people cannot work in this sector, especially in large urban areas. If they are to work in such areas, in many cases, they either have to live at home or commute long distances. Asking teachers to commute two or three hours a day to work in urban areas is just not good enough. This crisis is of the Government's making. It has to be resolved through the Government focusing on the salaries and conditions of teachers and the cost of living they are experiencing. Unless it gets to grips with that, this situation will last into the future. Teachers have been dealing with other elements of their terms and conditions. Many teachers were paid for responsibilities and posts previously. Due to the cuts after 2010, they were deleted and much of that has not been returned to teachers as of yet. There is also the differential caused by the two-tier pay delivered to teachers, especially young teachers entering the market, after 2010. That differential has left a big financial hole in the experience of many teachers in this country. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party are presiding over the corrosion of the education system in this country in a way that is having a material and negative effect on the outcomes of this generation of students in schools. That will manifest itself in a range of different issues, including mental health, reaching their full potential in the future, productivity, and incomes of those children. This Government needs to take this crisis seriously. It should not allow it to simply stagger on year after year but get to grips with it. Education is one of the most important services we provide as a State. If we consider the amount of money we are paying off in interest on the national debt, it is not that far off the total budget for the education system in this country. That is an incredible thing. The interest we are paying off on the national debt is not that far off the total budget for the education system in this country. We have to take education seriously. This country prides itself and sells itself internationally on having a quality-educated generation but that will not last. There will be a major cost to the country, as well as individuals within society, unless the Government gets to grips with this issue. At present, the crisis in education is so bad that many teachers are finding it very difficult to stay in the profession. Is fadhb ollmhór é seo agus caithfidh an Rialtas glacadh leis go tapa.

I do not agree with Deputy Barry on much, but I agree with everything he said. We can pay the bankers, or any of the senior civil servants in Departments who want to move extra money, but we cannot support our teachers. They play such an important role in giving tuition, learning, education and life skills to na daoine óga, our children. Is mór an trua é. The situation is not good enough and it is right across the spectrum. I will mention the Department of Education. The Minister of State claims to have invested additional funding in special education resources but this is not reflected in the experiences of schools, according to the National Principals' Forum. In the area in which I live, we have had no special educational needs organiser, SENO, for a prolonged period of nearly six months. The SENO who is covering fails to respond to queries and parents are fobbed off. All the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units are full, with no places available at all in south Tipperary. I support all the boards of management, principals, and assistant principals in the job they do, with such scarce and minuscule resources and such a lack of respect from the Department of Education. It is quite shocking and just not good enough. This is another failure by the Government of our children with additional needs. We urgently need to take action to address the failures. According to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, we see teachers voting with their feet and going abroad. What did the Government do this week? It decided, above all times and when there is such a crisis, to cancel or try to wipe out extended leave and career breaks for teachers. It just beggars belief that the Government would do this. What has it got against teachers? As I said, our youth are most important. Of course, the Rural Independent Group values our refugees. I do not need a lecture from an Teachta Bríd Smith about that. We value every human being from the womb to the tomb, as far as I am concerned. We do not have any issue with that.

A recent Teachers' Union of Ireland survey found 91% of post-primary schools experienced teacher recruitment difficulties in the past six months, while 61% experienced teacher retention difficulties. Some special education teachers are being forced to plug gaps in primary school mainstream classrooms. A recent survey by the Irish Primary Principals' Network found 83% of schools, as a last resort, have had to redeploy special education teachers to mainstream classes in order to plug the gaps. On 29 November 2022, the Taoiseach stated in the House that, as a basic principle, he thought teachers and special needs resources should stay in special needs and "resources should always be ring-fenced for special needs students." On "Morning Ireland" on 30 November 2022, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, said that she has always made it clear in her capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion that no special education teachers or special needs assistants should be used other than for the purposes for which they were assigned. That is happening, however. It should not be happening but, unfortunately, it is. That is quite clear. There has been a lot of talk in the Chamber about Dublin, including accommodation and so on. I am on the board of a school. I was chairperson of that board for many years and am now just a board member. I know the difficulties there are in getting teachers. It must be remembered that in rural areas there are often significant travel issues relating to the price of fuel and so on. That is a big issue. It is no wonder we are losing talented teachers and they are going abroad. There are also issues relating to the school capitation grants. I thank Our Lady of Mercy National School in Bantry, where I attended a debate on Monday. I thank Ms Karen Buckley and Ms Maeve Keane, two of its teachers, and I wish Ms Maria Power the best on her retirement.

It is a serious issue in County Kerry, where many schools are coming to me about seeking help from the Department of Education with the staffing crisis, which has left many vulnerable pupils without specialised support. There is a critical time in a young person's life when he or she needs direct intervention and assistance. If the school the young person is attending is suffering staffing shortages at that time, then the child and his or her parents will spend the following years trying to catch up. This is not acceptable. When a child needs assistance, support and extra tuition and guidance but those are not available at a critical time, the child will fall behind. Schools and principals I am dealing with all around the county of Kerry are telling me that they are experiencing these problems. At a time when so much in taxes is being paid by the hard-working parents and other taxpayers of Ireland, it is not good enough that we do not have adequate resources in our schools when we need them. I plead with the Minister of State on behalf of the principals, who work so hard with their teachers, boards of management and priests. Many Deputies would hate to recognise the value of priests and the Catholic religion, but I support them-----

I worked with his son, James, on the council. Teacher recruitment in key areas like Irish, maths, home economics and French is difficult in most second level schools. Most secondary schools have vacancies, according to a survey of principals. A TUI poll of almost 100 principals and deputy principals found that 91% had experienced difficulty in hiring qualified teachers in the past six months. The union has stated that recruitment and retention problems are affecting the quality of education for students, who can miss out on subject choices. Some teachers are getting minimum contract hours and are unable to pay their rents or for cars to drive to school. Like gardaí, teachers can be placed anywhere in the country. This is not affordable. I listened to Deputy Ó Ríordáin of the Labour Party speaking about Dublin, the capital. When Labour was in government, it helped to destroy Dublin by overpopulating it. If the population was spread around the country, it would help businesses, schools and everything else. Every Deputy has his or her own capital, and mine is Limerick. I will do whatever I must for Limerick city and county. That is what I am here to do. Rural Independents have been blamed for this situation, but we are not to blame. It was the fault of the Labour Party when it was in government, when it destroyed Dublin and made it too expensive for anyone who wants to work and live here. That is on Labour's own back.

We are facing a serious teacher shortage issue, with the education of our children at stake. The fact that 91% of our secondary schools are experiencing teacher recruitment issues is concerning. The TUI survey, which is mentioned in the motion, revealed that 71% of schools that advertised jobs in recent months had not got a single applicant. That is unbelievable. There is not a single area in the country that is not affected by this. My constituency of Donegal is experiencing significant problems in recruiting and retaining teachers. Parents will know this, as their children are having to sit through free class after free class while principals struggle to find teachers to even supervise those classes, never mind actually teach them. The Government can hardly be surprised at this stage. Consider for a moment what this country offers our teachers: an accommodation shortage; high rental costs; no hope of ever buying or building a house; a cost-of-living crisis; long commutes; a skeleton public transport service; a broken healthcare system; astronomical childcare costs; few permanent teaching contracts; job instability; and a low standard of living. Is it any wonder that we are seeing such high emigration rates among our newly qualified teachers as well as our newly qualified nurses and, indeed, all young people who are newly qualified and in search of a decent standard of living? This is no country for young people. Sadly, it is no country for anyone at the minute. Schools are relying heavily on student teachers. PME students are working hard to fill the gap left by teacher shortages. Without them, schools would even struggle to open. I have been contacted by many PME students who are finding the pressure of this, as well as college and other work, difficult. To complete a PME, one needs to complete two years at college and 440 hours of placement in a school. However, most PME students are now expected by schools to work a full school week due to current shortages. This would be difficult enough in itself, but most PME students are forced to undertake other work due to the fact that it costs more than €10,000 to complete the two-year degree. PME students are people who have already undertaken an undergraduate degree. As such, the idea that they are able to pay more than €10,000 while also paying to live in Dublin, one of the most expensive capitals in the world, for two years is unreasonable. It is therefore impossible for students to complete this degree without also undertaking other jobs. The Minister for Education needs to consider the lack of permanent contracts. The sad reality is that teachers are often in precarious employment due to a lack of permanent contracts. They are being paid less than teachers recruited before 2011. The Minister is considering the suspension of non-statutory leave arrangements such as career breaks, which will not address this issue in any way and may actually make the problem worse. There is little to encourage teachers to stay in this country as matters stand and the option of non-statutory leave may just well be the one thing keeping many of them from leaving. We have to hold on to the teachers we have. If we do not, the situation will only get worse until we are faced with ongoing school closures. We also need to address the obstacles facing those who are considering teaching as a profession. We need to fund the PME fully so that people can afford to complete the degree and we need to put emphasis on ongoing professional development, which can be completed online to facilitate rural schools. There are solutions out there for the Minister if she is willing to listen and engage, but that is the problem - there is no listening or engaging.

Unfortunately, it is a daily issue for many families and virtually every school. Highlighting it in the Dáil is important because not every school is prepared to come forward and say that it has trouble sourcing teachers, including substitute teachers. Some schools do not want to admit that children are sometimes being minded instead of being taught. Crucially, what school wants to say that its pupils with special needs are not being supported properly? In this context, I thank the Social Democrats. They have now made it easier for schools to say that they have a problem. Suffering in silence helps no one. Schools know that many of them are facing the same issues, given that principals and teachers speak, but once it is recognised that this is a national problem and is not confined to one or two of them, we will have a better chance of finding solutions. The Minister has proposed a number of positive suggestions and some of her proposals will make a difference in the short term, but much of it is just tinkering around the edges.We must examine some structural changes in this regard. The proposals in this motion are what the Minister needs to be considering. They are designed to provide solutions in the medium to long term, with one or two short-term proposals as well. First, we need permanent, full-time jobs to be given to teachers on their first appointments, if these jobs are available. I do not know what is going on here. Perhaps somebody can explain to me why this is not happening. We desperately need teachers, so why are we driving them away by not offering them the full-time jobs we desperately need to fill? When I started teaching, and that was a long time ago, I got a full-time job on day one and all the people who taught with me also got a full-time job on day one. I do not, therefore, know what is happening here or where this is coming from, but it needs to stop. How are teachers supposed to plan for a life or try to look at getting a mortgage or whatever it is they wish to do? They just cannot. Having put what I referred to in place, we then need a proper promotional structure. It is not enough just to offer people jobs; we must offer them a career pathway. Young teachers are voting with their feet and going abroad. If they were offered decent employment, and what I mean by this is a full-time job with real promotional prospects, more of them would stay. It would not be all of them, but it would be more of them. As several Deputies said, we need a review of the PME. Significant costs of more than €10,000 are involved, and this is stopping people taking this pathway. Another practical step that can be taken is to eliminate delays when it comes to the re-registration of teachers with the Teaching Council. This is not rocket science. It is an administrative issue and can be dealt with. With regard to those who have taught abroad outside the EU, I suggest to the Minister for Education that she recognise their years of service if they wish to return here and teach. This would help to attract more teachers back.

Ensuring our children are taught by qualified teachers is a priority issue for the Department of Education and the Government. This morning we have heard about the various measures put in place by the Department and the education partners to address teacher supply. Approximately 3,500 newly qualified teachers have had their registrations finalised by the Teaching Council in 2022 to date. These teachers are an additional source of supply in the current school year. New regulations are in place allowing the registration of third and fourth year undergraduate initial teacher education students with the Teaching Council. Flexible arrangements for teachers job-sharing or on career break have been put in place, along with temporary arrangements for a pension abatement waiver for retired teachers and a capacity to work beyond the full 22-hour teaching time for post-primary teachers. Teacher supply is a complex issue. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, acknowledged earlier that wider societal challenges associated with the cost of living and the availability of housing are affecting the supply of teachers. This is a challenge faced by every sector. The Minister outlined to the House the measures the Government is putting in place to address this situation. She also noted that the starting salary for teachers in Ireland has improved significantly in recent times and that the starting salary here is significantly greater than that in Northern Ireland. The motion before us makes a wide range of points regarding teacher shortages. It fails, however, to acknowledge the significant work already been done by the Department and the education partners in this area. For example, we now have 450 teachers employed on supply panels, covering sub-vacancies in schools right across the country. These teachers are providing an invaluable service in our classrooms and were not available to schools in these numbers previously. We also have the free programmes for post-primary registered teachers to upskill in subjects where teacher supply is problematic, such as in mathematics, Spanish and physics. This represents a considerable investment by the State. By the end of 2024, approximately 750 teachers should have completed these programmes and registered with the Teaching Council in these subjects. The motion also fails to take account of the fact that there are increasing options for young people to study to be teachers over four years in subjects such as modern foreign languages, Irish, mathematics and computer science. These offer the opportunity to qualify as a teacher in four years and to avoid the time and expense of taking the PME route. The school system continues to respond well to the constant challenges thrown at it. Having weathered a pandemic, we have, in more recent times, needed to ensure that large numbers of Ukrainian children have access to education. More than 3,500 additional teaching posts have been put into the system in the current year. Despite the actions taken already, the Government accepts that challenges remain and further steps must be implemented. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has outlined to the House further actions being advanced or under consideration. The Government recognises the leadership role the Department of Education plays on this issue. It is also true that the issues of teacher demand and supply require the contribution and co-operation of a broad range of education partners. The Department of Education will continue to work closely and intensively with stakeholders to develop and implement solutions to address the current teacher supply challenges.

Since then, however, in engaging with schools in Cork South-West and beyond, and through receiving messages on social media, I am realising how truly desperate the situation has got. Let us imagine being the principal of a primary school and getting a message late in the evening from a teacher to say they cannot come into work the next day. Let us also imagine that in this scenario it is possible for this teacher to get a sick certificate to cover their absence. That principal would first need to ring the teachers on the substitute panel, and in some places this consists of only two teachers for up to 30 schools, to confirm what will already be known, namely, that, in all likelihood, those teachers will not be available as they are scheduled to work elsewhere. The principal will then have to spend hours ringing around to see if it is possible to find anyone else. Again, this is likely to be a pointless task. One principal described to me the dread they feel every evening at the prospect of a teacher calling in sick because they know they will have to go through pointless hoops and merry-go-rounds to try to find a solution. What about the situation where the teacher in question cannot get a sick certificate? What if it is necessary for a teacher to miss work because of a family emergency or a bereavement, for example, and not illness? This would mean that a principal would be out of luck and so would the students. In some schools, special education teachers and SNAs are forced to step in to cover the classes, which is a disgrace in itself because, crucially, it takes away precious special education teaching hours from other students. Let us imagine now being a principal in a small rural school, where there is no special education teacher on the staff or perhaps there is only one in a dedicated class. The principal in this case would not only fulfil that role but would also have classes of their own to teach. There may only be three teachers on the staff, including the principal, and one of them cannot come in. What on earth is the principal supposed to do in that situation? Due to the changes in the substitution rules, there are classes in schools around Ireland being left without any teacher or even basic supervision, potentially for weeks at a time. The people I spoke to in the few schools who were not having issues getting substitute teachers said it was because they had established relationships with substitute teachers in the area who are not on the panel. They told me there is no point in trying to get those people on the panel as they are constantly in demand. Does the Minister of State recognise that teachers need leave for reasons other than illness and that, in those instances, students still need teachers? Does he also recognise that the panels are not sufficient? Another issue that could easily be addressed is that there is no central vetting system for SNAs. Therefore, an SNA must be vetted by each individual school. This makes it unnecessarily hard to get a substitute SNA. One school pointed out to me that there could be a vetting system for SNAs similar to the Teaching Council. That school was down two SNAs that day. Children with disabilities and special educational needs are being failed by the State every day. First, they have a disgracefully long waiting list to contend with. This is just to get an assessment of needs.That is before one joins the disgracefully long waiting lists for the essential therapies that one needs. Early intervention is a pipe dream when one is on these waiting lists. Accessible transport is another area where these families are being failed. The list goes on. I could, quite literally, go on all day. The least that people should be able to expect is a place in a suitable class in a school. That is the bare minimum, and some people do not even get that. Schools in Cork South-West that have been in touch with the National Council for Special Education about this are not even getting a reply. Schools have inquired with a SENO and have not received a reply. One principal described this to me as like sending a message to Pluto. In the meantime, parents are asking schools if there will be a place for their child in September 2023. What are the schools supposed to say to these families? We have all - I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, has too - been hearing from distressed parents about the extraordinary knock-on effects of this. To think that the staff allocation to meet the needs of those who manage to get an appropriate place in a class is being taken away because, yet again, the State is failing them is hard to fathom. This has to stop. The only solution we are hearing from the Government during a staff shortage is to make the job less desirable by removing the option of a career break. This is a sad and, quite frankly, worrying indictment of where we are at. It is not surprising because it is the kind of counterproductive approach we have come to expect. Progressing Disability Services is such a failure that people increasingly do not want to work in the disability sector - a sector that could and should be brilliant and rewarding to work in. The same is starting to happen in teaching. We need to immediately establish an emergency teacher supply task force informed by stakeholders to identify tangible solutions to the shortages, as well as all of the other calls in the Social Democrats motion as outlined by Deputy Gannon.

I thank all the contributors today, including both Ministers of State. I have to be honest. It was some stroke, was it not? It was almost a stroke of monumental proportions. Having been contacted by parents, as I am sure everyone in the Chamber has been, and in consultation with schools in all of our communities, we brought forward a motion to deal with the teacher supply crisis in our schools. The motion makes 11 suggestions for how the shortage of teachers could be alleviated to some degree. Following an incorporeal meeting late last night, at which this was not on the agenda, we heard the solution that has come forth from the Government. For valid reasons, no Minister is present here today and no Minister has been made available to answer to the media. The Government's solution focuses on career breaks. We know it was not even designed to be a solution. It was designed to evade, to dilute the narrative and to put the spotlight back onto teachers, as if somehow they are being duplicitous for having the audacity to take a career break. In some instances, people take career breaks to look after their families or, heaven forbid, to go off to earn the rent that they cannot afford in cities around Ireland. It was incredible. I should not be surprised but even I was shocked, as, indeed, were the schools who have contacted all of us over the past 12 hours. It is monumental. Rather than talking about salaries, conditions, terms of pay or the PME, they talk about career breaks. No Minister stood forward here today. No Government representative came in to admit that given that we are understaffed in our schools, this measure, which has captured attention, will bring not one teacher back into the system over the next two months. It will do nothing to address the shortages of staff in our schools. It is incredible. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, shocked me even further in her response. We highlighted the fact that in 83% of schools, as a last resort, principals have had to redeploy special education teachers to mainstream classes to plug the gaps. In her response, the Minister of State spoke about "banked SET hours". Her prepared script continued:The importance in providing regular and structured support on a weekly basis to students with special education needs is crucial to their educational development ...Who is she telling? More importantly, what is she doing about it? I appreciate that the Minister of State said it is an issue but she did not say what the solution is and what the Department will do about it. The Minister of State referenced something that was not even contained within our motion. It is incredible. We are here today talking about a shortage of staff in our schools that is having consequences for the everyday learning experience of children and young people the length and breadth of Ireland. We could be applying the exact same standard to any one of our essential front-line public services. We could have been talking about nurses having to leave because they cannot afford the rent. We could be talking about gardaí because they cannot afford the rent either. The crisis across our public services is not a result of global factors. It is not a result of the pandemic. It is a result of successive centre-right Governments in this country which have broken the social contract and the responsibility for that lies squarely at the Government's door. We implore the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, as a representative of the Government sitting here today - I appreciate he is here by himself - to take action, give this the recognition it deserves, get together and decide how we can keep our schools open and flourishing, and how we can diversify the type of people who can access the profession. Something must be done. Sitting here, diluting the waters, doing what we always do and saying that it is not the Government's fault - it is about those pesky teachers taking career breaks - is ludicrous and shameful. It is a sad reflection on this Government. There is no accountability and there are no solutions. They are scrambling for ideas at the last minute and offering nothing but blame. It is scandalous. The Social Democrats will not stand for it and that is why we brought this motion to the Dáil today.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	53	Vicky Phelan died three weeks ago. The Taoiseach knows she spent her final years fighting for change. She was very clear on what she wanted to see. To recall, she said to the political system:I don't want your accolades or your broken promises. I want action. I want change. I want accountability.It was a most eloquent and heartbreaking call to action for all of the women and their families affected by the CervicalCheck scandal. As the Taoiseach knows, mandatory disclosure and a duty of candour was one of Vicky's core demands. Mandatory disclosure means a legal obligation on clinicians and health care providers to tell a woman if there had been a discordant, erroneous or incorrect reading of her cervical cancer screening slide. There was consensus in the Oireachtas that the original patient safety Bill did not provide for this demand. The week that Vicky died the Taoiseach assured the Dáil that an amendment to the legislation to correct for this flaw would be brought forward. At that time I said to the Taoiseach that the Opposition would work with the Government to get the legislation right and get it over the line before the Christmas recess. This remains my position and our commitment. However, we have a problem in that the amendment proposed by the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, does not provide for mandatory disclosure. There is provision for a right to review and this is welcome. However, there is a distinction between a right to review and a positive obligation on a clinician or a health service provider to reveal and pass on information. Mandatory disclosure where the legal responsibility is on clinicians and organisations is what the women fought for. It is the measure recommended by Dr. Gabriel Scally in his scoping inquiry. Let me cut to the chase in all of this. I believe there are still serious flaws in the legislation. I do not believe the amendments the Minister has proposed address these flaws. Above all else there is no way that two hours today is sufficient time for us to tease our way through this legislation to get it right. The objective here has to be to get this right. I do not believe either that the House should divide on this matter. We were of one voice when we marked the death of Vicky. We said that we would work together. I am asking the Taoiseach as head of the Government for us to work together. What this means in my strong opinion is that we have the debate for two hours today after which we adjourn it and that more time is made available next week. There is concern beyond the definition of mandatory disclosure or the duty of candour about the review process itself. There is no legal obligation for the woman at the point of diagnosis to be told she has a right to the review. What is very worrying from my point of view is a provision that means in the case of CervicalCheck and the laboratories that the laboratories themselves would decide the scope and shape of the reviews. I do not believe that we can pass legislation that lets these things go. Again I ask the Taoiseach to work with us. I know I have the support of the Labour Party and others on the Opposition benches. We really have to get this right. I believe we can get it right and over the line before we rise for Christmas.

We did all agree that we would commit to getting the legislation through the House before the recess, particularly in light of Vicky's passing and her strong exhortation that we would fulfil all of the recommendations arising out of the Scally review and the expert reference group that dealt with interval cancer. The report was published in October 2020 and the legislation is in line with this report. We must remember that the report was made up of input from professionals as well as patient representative groups and all involved from a patient perspective. The report recommended, essentially, that CervicalCheck should establish a process to conduct patient requested reviews of all invasive cancers and establish a standard operating procedure for this purpose:Patient-requested reviews should only be undertaken following receipt of written consent from the patient. These reviews should be available to all women diagnosed with invasive cancers, including historic cases of women who did not participate in any other National Screening Service or Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists cytology review processes.I am quoting directly from the expert reference group's interval cancer report. The expert reference group recognised the educational value of programmatic review of cytology of all invasive cancers including interval cancers. The report states:The Expert Reference Group recognises the educational value of programmatic review of cytology of all invasive cancers including interval cancers. The Expert Reference Group therefore recommends that Clinical Audits be conducted only where either (1) such Clinical Audits are both blinded and anonymised; or (2) legislation protecting the confidentiality of Clinical Audits is passed by the Oireachtas.Essentially persons presenting for screening would be advised that they may seek a review of their case files in the event of an interval cancer arising between a first and second screening. The Bill now states there is a mandatory obligation to disclose to every patient who seeks such a review of their files and an that the files would be made available to the patients. This is exactly in line with what the recommendation of the expert reference group has ordained. This is a positive amendment and we need to go with it. It would deal with issues the Sinn Féin spokesperson raised at the committee with regard to the patient review approach. It was not in the Bill when it last came before the House. The Minister undertook to go back and has come back with a very important amendment that provides for mandatory disclosure. This is what we are all seeking. The expert review group went through in quite considerable detail clinical audit as opposed to a patient requested review.There is a lot of merit in how the expert group has proceeded on this front. The Minister stands ready to engage further with Sinn Féin's spokesperson and others on this issue. We want to do what is best for the women of Ireland. This pertains to all screening programmes. Programmatic audits are about identifying issues at system level and we need to have such audits across all various screening programmes, including bowl and breast screenings, etc. That needs to happen regularly to indicate opportunities for improvements in such programmes. The person who has been screened should have a right enshrined in law to access that and this is what the amendment provides.

I remind the House that this legislation is about the provision of information. It is not about medical malpractice or any other legal processes. This is about information. I believe the Taoiseach, like the rest of us, wants to get this right for women. There are serious matters in this Bill that need to be teased through to ensure we get it right. Two hours for the debate is simply not sufficient to get that work done. At the end of the day, people will ask what real difference would this have made in Vicky's or other women's cases and what difference it will make going forward. I am concerned about the anonymised nature of the audits. While the right to a review is welcome, there is no legal obligation for a patient under CervicalCheck to be informed of the right of review. These things need a little bit more time and we have the scope, this week or next week, to afford more time to this. I ask that we adjourn after two hours and afford more time to the debate to be absolutely sure that we get it right. We have waited for four years and a half years for this legislation. A couple of more hours is required to make sure we get it right.

In the most recent report, Dr. Scally stated the CervicalCheck programme was greatly enhanced because Vicky Phelan and others raised very serious issues pertaining to how the programme and audits were conducted. The expert review group, which was informed by patient advocates, representatives of the 221+ group and professionals, recognised the approach of patient requested reviews. The big difference is that people going forward for screening will be told they may seek their files if, for example, an interval cancer arises between the first and the second screenings. As per the programme they will be able to get full access. Due to the amendment to the Bill, it will be mandatory for the programme to disclose all information pertaining to the individual. I will ask the Government Whip to speak to the Sinn Féin Whip about what can be done.

It would be sensible to adjourn the debate rather than to conclude the debate after two hours today, and I note the Taoiseach's comments that the whips should co-ordinate on that matter. A substantial number of amendments have been tabled and concerns have been raised about flaws in the Bill, therefore, it would be sensible to adjourn the debate and give it a little more time next week. That is the wish of all of us in opposition. I raise the issue of increasing concerns among parents and teachers in recent weeks. They have been expressing their concern about severe staff shortages in schools, which was the subject of an earlier debate today. I am also increasingly hearing of frustration from parents of younger children, children of preschool age, who cannot access a place for their child in early years education and care in my constituency and others around the country. I have raised this previously and thank the Taoiseach for his engagement on specific issues about individual crèche closures, but this is part of a broader, systematic problem with childcare and early years education in this country. We need urgent State intervention to address this problem. What is lacking is a real acknowledgement at the centre of Government of the lack of provision of childcare services for children and parents who rely on childcare providers and, indeed, a lack of supports for providers that are closing. I acknowledge incremental steps have been taken. In particular, we in the Labour Party have welcomed the establishment of the employment regulation order for early years workers and professionals. I also acknowledge the Big Start campaign and SIPTU's input into that. Notwithstanding improvements in pay for professionals, there is still a problematic and flawed system for parents. They are now being told to reserve their child's place when at the very early stages of pregnancy, before the child is even born, and even then they cannot be sure of getting a place at a childcare facility. Tonight, Labour Senators will table a motion in the Seanad to address the crisis in Ireland's childcare system and to call for a change in policy to ensure we no longer have the postcode lottery that so often determines the availability of places and their affordability. High, exorbitant and rising fees are a huge issue for many parents. Several parents have come to me to say they simply cannot afford a childcare place even where there is one available. Let us remember Ireland has the highest proportion of private providers of childcare in the OECD and many smaller providers are being squeezed on costs. We need a universal, publicly-funded childcare system in Ireland and we in the Labour Party have been calling for that consistently. Will the Taoiseach commit to the rolling out of such a scheme and will he commit to reduce the cost of childcare as part of that to a cap of €200 per month per child, as we have sought?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	64	I thank the Deputy for raising what is an important issue. It has always been my view that, historically, Ireland has been slow in respect of the early years sector. So rapid is the development of a child, human beings learn more from birth to the age of three than they will in the rest of their lives. From birth to six years of age, we need to provide the best of education and developmental opportunities for children. As things have evolved in Ireland over the past 30 years we have had community-led early educational childcare services. That became more organised through many private providers and some State providers, some of which focus on disadvantaged communities and others on special needs. There is no doubt in the past two to three years there has been a substantial increase in funding and an expansion of childcare services. In last year's budget, the focus of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, which I supported, was to improve pay and conditions and the overall environment and career pathway for people working in the early education sector. There was good news in autumn this year, following the budget and the provision of funding, when an employment regulation order was agreed, the first ever between employers and employees. I would like to see that advanced and progressed in the years ahead. The Deputy will know there was a substantial increase in core funding in this year's budget. Last year was about trying to get significant improvements in terms of conditions for staff. This is it was about affordability for parents. Substantial resources have been made available which will result in a substantial reduction in the cost of childcare for parents. The third issue is capacity. We have to continue to expand capacity and we are open to work with the Deputy, Sinn Féin and others, in that regard.With regard to ECCE services, that is, the sessional services where there has been a change in the model and concerns expressed by some providers, the allocation has gone up from €14 million last year to €27 million per year on top of standard capitation. That is a 90% increase this year alone. The federation had agreed to cancel the previous objective of closing services on the day to highlight issues it had. The Minister, in light of the concerns raised in respect of sessional services, in order to provide additional timely and robust data in preparation for developments to core funding in year 2, has signalled the Department will now undertake an independent review of the financial viability of small sessional services to be completed in quarter 1 of 2023. He has written to the federation regarding this review.

However, I was in London to meet with Keir Starmer and other colleagues from our sister party, the British Labour Party, as well as with the Irish ambassador, Martin Fraser. While we were there, a report was published by the Institute for Public Policy Research and the charity, Save the Children, that made a recommendation central to this point of childcare. It recommends a universal childcare guarantee be introduced in Britain as a means of boosting economic growth and cutting inequality, particularly gender inequality. That sort of visionary moment is needed here. We need to see a vision set out for the provision of early years education here in Ireland, a vision akin to that of the Fianna Fáil Minister, Donogh O'Malley, 50 years ago, when he introduced free secondary education for all children. It was a groundbreaking vision that has changed Irish society so much in the intervening half century. However, we need to see that vision rolled out and a Donogh O'Malley moment for early years education. We need to see a universal childcare guarantee of the sort being pushed for in Britain done here. Will the Government commit to that sort of visionary approach to childcare in early years education?

He put meat on the table. We need to have the vision but we also need to put flesh on the bone. We need to follow through with resources. I also take the Deputy's point on the organisation of childcare. We need universal access to childcare and we need to make sure every child has access but I am conscious of how the sector has evolved in Ireland. There is a multiplicity of providers, all of whom jealously guarded their domain. We have to work within that framework but I take the Deputy's overall view. These are the most important years and we have to provide universality.

I will do this by giving an example of a case that proves the dysfunction in our system. Michael O'Sullivan of Dromroughty, Kenmare, County Kerry is a ten-year-old boy who is profoundly autistic and has a working diagnosis of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability, ATR-X, syndrome, which is rare. He has two loving parents in Jean and Teddy who care for him and go above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis to care for their young son who is being failed by the health service in this country. In 2019, at the age of eight, Michael suffered from a perforated bowel. Prior to this he had been waiting to see the gastro team in Crumlin hospital. It is no exaggeration to say that the perforation in his bowel when taken to University Hospital Kerry, UHK, that night almost killed young Michael. When suggested that he be airlifted to Dublin from UHK, a consultant said, "He won't make it in the air". That is how serious the matter was. Michael spent a total of 13 weeks in hospital following this. Following his stay in hospital, he continued to have serious issues with bowel movements, to the point where he now cannot have a bowel movement without the assistance of several doses of laxatives on a daily basis. For anyone who has experienced the discomfort of constipation and the pain it can cause, he or she can imagine facing this pain as a ten-year-old little boy on a daily basis. Michael had to wait until January 2021 before meeting the gastro team in Dublin again. He met with them for half an hour and was prescribed medication that did not work. All subsequent appointments were done by phone rather than face to face. In October 2021, Michael spent a further two weeks in hospital where they were told they again would need to see the gastro team. Roll on to October 2022 and Michael was finally to see the team in Dublin. The appointment was cancelled and rescheduled for a few days later, but that dreaded call came from Dublin to say the appointment was cancelled. Michael, Jean and Teddy are still awaiting to get a call back with a rescheduled appointment.  The Taoiseach can stand up, blame Covid and talk about how much money the Government has spent on healthcare, how much capacity it has added and how winter has an impact on the system. Winter comes every year and the Government has done nothing to help Michael and, importantly, other children like him who, on a daily basis, are let down and left to suffer. I ask the Taoiseach to deal with this. The HSE is broken beyond repair.  Michael is suffering. He is crippled in pain every day. He cannot have bowel movements without laxatives and, worse again, he cannot get help. Why do we only have one gastro team for children in Ireland? Why do we not have one in Cork that could do appointments in UHK once a month? As Jean said, "Everyone is going the same direction up to Dublin - a never-ending bottleneck of people trying to access the one service, where you could be in Cashel and told your appointment is cancelled yet again".

It is a very serious issue for young Michael and his parents, Jean and Teddy. The objective is, and should be, that this young child gets the very best of treatment for that young child that guarantees the best outcome and enables him to live a reasonable quality of life. From what the Deputy has said, that has not materialised from the health service. I do not have the individual background to the case, but I will follow it up. The Deputy has identified a very rare condition. In addition to being on what I think he said was the serious end of the autism spectrum, the fact that Michael has a rare condition with significant implications for gastro health seems to suggest he needs a referral and to be treated in the national centre in Crumlin and, eventually, in the new children's hospital. That requires a certain level of expertise that would only be provided in a national centre with a level of gastro expertise that would not be available in every centre in the country similar to cardiac, cancer or other major issues or, indeed, other rare diseases that affect different organs of the body. One needs that access. The point the Deputy legitimately raised is that once those appointments happen and the requisite level of expertise is applied to the case, there should be a facility whereby whatever is prescribed or whatever programme is outlined for young Michael should be communicated, certainly to CUH, in order that there could be intermittent reviews and so on and a linkage with Crumlin in respect of how young Michael is treated and so forth. The rarity of the condition is such that expert advice is needed. I will follow up the case on the Deputy's behalf to see if additional external expertise could be brought to bear on the case. The Deputy will appreciate I am not fully au fait with the case but I will follow up on it.

I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Health and I ask him, the Taoiseach and the Government please to take this young boy on board. I ask them to take him into their heads but, most importantly, before Christmas, I ask them to take him into their hearts.We have gastro teams for adults but, as the Minister knows, we only have one gastro team dedicated to children. It is disappointing and heartbreaking for Jean, Teddy and young Michael to have an appointment and to get ready for the enormity of getting their bags packed and their car ready for the long journey to Dublin, only to have that pulled out from them at the last minute. Many Members present are parents. I ask them to take into their hearts and heads how it would be if that was their child, nephew, or niece, if they knew that the child had a pain in their belly every day and knowing the pain that creates in their heart. I ask them to please take this case on board. Let him get the attention he needs. I would be the first person to compliment the Taoiseach. I raised a case here not too long ago when two children needed millions of euro to be spent and the Government, Minister for Health, Taoiseach and Tánaiste took it on board and did it. I was grateful for that and ask the Government to please do the same again. I thank the Taoiseach.

Many of us as Deputies encounter families where are significant health issues and I always recommend that a child would go to Crumlin because I would always be concerned that there may not be sufficient local expertise to deal with a rare condition. The issue is they should not have to face the kind of cancellations that occur. That is what the new national children's hospital is about. Unfortunately, it is taking time to complete that. That will create capacity. It will also separates outpatients from inpatients and so on. Equally, once a certain level of expertise and treatment has been applied, there should be linkages so that people are not travelling all the time. The nearest hospital could then deal with some issues that invariably arise from time to time with such conditions. However, we will follow it up.

There is a dire need to get work done and to get houses built. I know the Government is bringing Bills forward in the coming weeks. Regarding the construction sector, I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy McGrath, revised figures for what we would call Government jobs that contractors would do, but there is a serious problem around the country where houses are being built and other works that are not Government-related are ongoing and the price of materials and of doing the job has gone up. Battles are going on. Looking at the statistics, the number of companies ceasing business or going into liquidation is worrying. The Taoiseach saw earlier this year what happened to one of our biggest road contractors, Roadbridge. We see this week after week, especially in the Dublin area. Unfortunately, many of the companies that are ceasing are from Northern Ireland. The big problem is that smaller subcontractors, whether brickie or a person with excavators to do groundwork or people who do other phases of work, are being left high and dry. This has a knock-on effect on those subcontractors. In fairness to him, former Senator, Feargal Quinn, tabled a Bill that required a certificate which contractors could later go into court with. We have to try to nip this in the bud. If a client employs a main contractor, the subcontractor that works for the client should have a signature or certification before the client gives the main contractor the money to make sure that subcontractor is paid. I know the Taoiseach will move positions in the next week. I do not know where he will go. Whether he has the trade portfolio, or in whatever part of government this is required, I ask that a regulation or legislation be brought in so that where the client is paying the main contractor, there is a certification system so that every subcontractor is paid on-site. It is not complicated. Revenue has all the details of any subcontractor that works on-site. It is not a long list to have to go through. I urge Government to do this because there are many small employers that have two, three or four people working for them and they are being left high and dry. It will put them to the wall. Will the Government look at that in the coming months?

Capacity in the construction industry and the economy more generally has expanded significantly in the past year. Some 416,000 more people are working in the economy now than in 2020, so the bounceback from Covid was significant. Many people lost jobs as a result of Covid but it is still an extraordinary figure. We set a target of 2.5 million people in employment for 2024. It has already been exceeded in 2022, since there now at 2.55 million people working in the economy. That is notwithstanding Brexit, the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, all of which have had significant impacts on the cost of building materials and so on. It is interesting to see that approximately 40,000 more people are working in the construction sector than last year and approximately 20,000 more than in 2019. Capacity is being built up and we are trying to build more. The Deputy raised specifics about subcontractors. He referred to the Construction Contracts Act 2013, which provides for the regulation of payments to subcontractors in particular. This is an issue that was raised at that time. He is right that former Senator, Feargal Quinn piloted it through the Seanad and then the Oireachtas. In light of what the Deputy said, we will undertake to review that Act. I will ask the Minister for Public Expenditure to review it to see if it can be improved. If the Deputy has any input and potential amendments to make, it could help to get the balance right. I recall much discussion of that Bill at the time. We are open to such reviews.

I acknowledge the additional people working in the economy. I am talking about when a client, be it the State or a private client, hires a main contractor. At the moment, some of those are going into liquidation. Unfortunately, many seem to be coming from Northern Ireland, from the trend I have observed. The subcontractor, which is a smaller outfit, is then left high and dry for the money. That is the big problem. I acknowledge the great work of Feargal Quinn. Given time, the then Government brought it in. However, subcontractors need a certificate and it is only after the event that they can try to go to court. It is not much good if the main contractor has gone into liquidation. I welcome that the Taoiseach is open to reviewing this again. I am proposing that before the main client, whether the State or the client who is building something privately, pays the main contractor, there should be some type of certification that the subcontractors on the site have signed to make sure that their payments are kept up to date. We have seen significant fallout from what happened with Roadbridge over the past six or eight months. Smaller subcontractors are being put to the wall because they cannot withstand the hit that they must take by not getting paid, whether for a month or two months. Generally, it runs to three months. If they have machines or people hired for different work, the figure builds up. Subcontractors do not have the capacity to withstand the belt from that. It is okay for whoever has gone into liquidation. They are a different story.However, these people have to face everything and try to survive it, which is impossible. I welcome what the Taoiseach said about being open to reviewing it.

He might feed through some of the individual examples to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, or me. That is one aspect of it. On the second aspect, we will give this further consideration in the form of a review of the existing Act and the regulations that govern this area of payment of subcontractors, to see if we can get the balance right.

Schools are really struggling to recruit teachers, teachers cannot afford the extortionate rents that are being charged and many are locked out of any real opportunity of ever purchasing their own home. I was shocked and gobsmacked to hear the Minister for Education's first response to this was a suggestion of cancelling career breaks for teachers, not least because she herself is on a career break from teaching. Clearly that is not the answer. Will the Taoiseach make clear to the Dáil that the cancellation of career breaks is not what is in mind? Furthermore, will he set out what the Government will do to address this real crisis in recruitment of teachers, which is wholly traceable to the housing crisis that has come on the Taoiseach's watch?

It is not, and no decision has been made on that. A whole range of initiatives have been taken in respect of teacher supply. The limits on substitute work applying to teachers on career breaks have also been temporarily suspended. The Teaching Council made regulations allowing for the registration of third- and fourth-year undergraduate student teachers under a new registration route, route 5. So far, over 2,100 students have applied for that registration. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has agreed to a waiver of pension abatement for retired teachers returning to teach for up to 50 days in each of the three calendar years from 2021 to 2023, inclusive. The Department of Education has put in place a scheme for 2022-23 to allow post-primary teachers to teach in their subject area over the usual limit of 22 hours per week, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Free upskilling programmes are now available for registered teachers and so on, as well as additional posts.

Last week, I asked about the tenant in situ scheme, which enables local authorities to take into State ownership homes that have been put up for sale and which would otherwise leave a tenant or family at risk of homelessness. I specifically asked if the Government could legislate to enable the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to provide data to local authorities to help them identify renters who are most at risk and who might be assisted by the tenant in situ scheme. In response, the Taoiseach referred to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage's repeated call on local authorities to buy such homes and operate the scheme and I welcome that 600 homes have been purchased through it. The difficulty is the scheme remains ad hoc and merely voluntary. We in the Labour Party are calling for the Government to ensure councils have a stronger imperative to implement the scheme and keep families out of homelessness and to use the period of the winter eviction ban to scale up delivery of homes for people.

I appreciate the motivation but we need to allow flexibility to each local authority. We very often criticise the centralisation of a whole range of decision-making and then every now and again, we pay lip service to the idea of devolution of authority to local councils. There is a balance to be struck here and a balance within the housing situation as well. The real focus has to continue to be-----

I ask the Taoiseach about district heating systems and communal heating systems. I have raised them with him before. The Government has said no one should be cut off this winter. Figures I have been given show 20% of tenants on prepay meters with district heating systems have now been cut off. They are without heat and hot water. Regulation in the future is all well and good but there needs to be action from the Government now so people living in freezing conditions can get heat and hot water for the Christmas period. This could be done through one-off energy credits or subsidies to bridge the gap between the commercial cost of gas and residential rates. Will the Government act now to address this so people can get access to heat and hot water for Christmas?

The National Transport Authority, NTA, has acknowledged there are now 3,000 taxi licences that are inactive. Taxi groups have been saying for some time - I reiterate their call - that drivers should be allowed to transfer licences to a nominated family member or somebody else. Many older taxi drivers have not wanted to return but currently they cannot transfer their licences unless they die. They could transfer their licences to nominated family members, friends or others and we could activate thousands of taxi licences. The taxi groups are also saying there are 50-minute waiting times to get in contact with the NTA to get suitability tests, etc. They are asking whether family members may be nominated to contact the NTA on their behalf on licence matters.

Current analysis carried out by the NTA indicates this campaign has been successful, with a 24% increase in small public service vehicle, SPSV, driver entry tests booked in November and an 84% increase compared with November 2021. Sorry, the 24% was compared with 2019.

I understand the decision not to allow the payment to these managers in CHO 5 has been appealed with no response. We have a recruitment and retention crisis and now we have morale on the floor in quite a large CHO.

Some of the reported concerns include that the vast majority of schools have pupils with additional educational needs who are awaiting diagnosis due to the chronic waiting lists. Over one third of schools had periods when they had no special educational needs organiser, SENO, to assess special needs.Some 55% of the schools surveyed stated that the additional needs educational profile does not meet the needs of the pupils. The list goes on and on. The Department of Education will say it is investing additional resources but that is not the reality on the ground. In my area in south Tipperary, we have not had a SENO for months. The position is vacant. Why is it, like the last Deputy from the south east said, that we are being neglected all the time? It is just another failure by the Government. Children with additional needs need these supports and they need them early. They need a timely diagnosis and access to help.

We have over 20,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, in the system, with additional special needs teachers and so forth. There is very extensive provision in special education. I do not think that can be argued with. We have had new special schools this year. I have been to a lot of schools where a lot of provision has been made.

These homes tend to be independent, small and family run. While some of the chains are replacing some of the lost beds, that is not happening in rural or smaller areas where family-run homes are closing. More and more older people will not be able to remain reasonably close to family, friends, GPs, pharmacists and so on. That is just wrong. In a small, 35-bed private nursing home, the current fair deal funding model would pay, on average, €1 million less per year than it pays to the same size HSE home. I keep hearing that HSE homes deal with more complex cases but where is the evidence? The Department of Health did a study, although it was too small, that showed there was little difference in the levels of dependence between public and private homes. We need an urgent review of the fair deal funding model.

The Department of Health acknowledges that there are variations in the cost of care across community hospitals and private nursing homes, with public community units generally having a higher cost of care. The HSE will always step in where a resident's needs are sufficiently complex that they are not able to be cared for anywhere else in the community. The HSE needs to be staffed to deliver that kind of complex care. I have put in place a €10 million scheme to cover 75% of energy costs from 1 July this year up to 31 December. Each nursing home can claim up to €31,500. Some €70 million in free PPE and oxygen has been provided over the last two years while €145 million of financial supports through temporary assistance payments has also been provided. Residents in HSE-run community nursing units, CNUs, which are often staffed at a level that allows the delivery of more complex care, represent less than 20% of those on the fair deal scheme. Last year, 4,500 residents were in these public CNUs.

The notice relates to high turbidity, which means Irish Water is not able to give a clear result. Great credit is due to the crews that are working weekends and long evenings trying to get the plant operational but the plant is not suitable. There is talk of getting an upgrade. In the meantime, there is a lot of stress and hassle on residents and businesses but there is also the issue of cost, especially with the high electricity rates. It is all down to Irish Water's own plant not functioning correctly. In the meantime, should Irish Water not be paying an electricity credit to these residents and businesses that are at a loss due to its plant?

Tuigim an méid atá ráite aige ó thaobh cabhair agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na dúiche ina bhfuil na fadhbanna. Regarding the cost of boiling water, Irish Water has a strong customer service focus. It outlines the standard of service customers should expect to receive, including codes of practice and so forth, and vulnerable customer communications. Its plan sets out a compensation mechanism for when water quality is compromised and unfit for human consumption, such as when boil water and drinking water restriction notices apply. There may be opportunities to pursue that with Irish Water in respect of the specifics of the situation in Macroom. The Deputy is correct that turbidity is the issue. Irish Water is currently working on this. As the Deputy said, the crews are out to try to resolve the immediate issues so they can lift the boil water notice but Irish Water is also progressing a major project to upgrade and modernise Macroom's water treatment plant to increase its capacity and get better resilience.

I acknowledge the work of CE supervisors. We have about 1,200 supervisors and assistant supervisors across the country. They are one of the most embedded and connected groups of community workers, broadly speaking, we have across the country. My Department has been engaging with the unions during the year. The supervisor union's representatives have engaged with the Workplace Relations Commission. The Department has been invited to the Workplace Relations Commission and I am minded to take up that invitation. However, we need the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do that. There is not much point in us walking into the Workplace Relations Commission unless we have the backing of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. While we are doing this, we may as well include the supervisors for Tús and the rural social scheme rather than doing it in bits and pieces over the next few years.

He also said he would follow up with the HSE and the Minister. Patients have now received letters sending them to GPs in Ballincollig, which has no direct link to Blarney. Some will be going as far as Ovens. This is despite an offer from a GP to run a temporary service and despite the Taoiseach's assurances. I assume that if the Taoiseach instructs the HSE to appoint a temporary GP, it would do this. The service is to close on 31 December. Will the Taoiseach please explain to the people of Blarney why this is happening?

It shows that waste generation in Ireland continues to increase and that our rising levels of waste make it very difficult for us to maintain or increase our current recycling rates. Crucially, it shows we are in danger of missing our EU 2025 targets for municipal waste and plastic packaging recycling targets. Ireland remains reliant on the export market to deal with the vast majority of waste generated in this country, including residual municipal waste, hazardous waste, plastic waste and, more recently, biowaste.In light of the passage of the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022, what measures will the Government take to plan for an improvement in the figures outlined by the EPA? Will the Government give a commitment to raise public awareness of the circular economy?

The 2020 data that have been published outline that Ireland must transition to a more sustainable circular economy. This is something the Government recognised and actioned before the announcement of these figures. Under the recently published Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022, Ireland will be able to drive behavioural change, provide a financial incentive for alternative treatment options and improve source segregation of our materials to create our circular economy. Proposed regulatory changes include the extension of incentivised pricing to commercial waste and the introduction of a waste recovery levy applying to operations at landfills and incineration plants and to exports of municipal solid waste. We continue to achieve all EU packaging recycling targets for 2020 and the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy 2020 sets out our approach. If one goes back over a 20- to 30-year period, Ireland has made rapid progress but one gets the sense it has stalled a bit. The population is rising. The new legislation will give us the impetus to move forward.

They were executed without trial or charge by the order of the Executive of the newly formed Free State Government. The executions were done as a reprisal for the sad and tragic killing of Deputy Seán Hales, a killing which these four men had no hand, act or part in. The event was described in a Dáil debate 100 years ago as, "Murder most foul, bloody and unnatural". The State has never acknowledged that these killings were illegal or wrong. The Taoiseach has said these killings were murder by any definition. Today, almost 100 years since those executions, I ask that the Government finally acknowledge that these killings were manifestly illegal and wrong.

Through the decade of centenaries, as a country, we have managed to remember, enlighten and give a greater, more informed perspective to our difficult and traumatic past, particularly at the time of the formation of the new State. I gave a more comprehensive and informed perspective on these issues in three significant speeches I gave on the Anglo-Irish Treaty 1921, in Trinity College Dublin, on the Civil War, in University College Cork, and on the formation of the Free State, in University College Dublin last Friday. The murder of Seán Hales was a terrible crime, objectively, not from looking back now on the past. The Deputy is correct that the contemporary Dáil records show that it was an extremely traumatic and bitter time in our history, particularly the contribution from the late Thomas Johnson of the Labour Party, in a significant speech where he called it out that week. What happened to those four young men at that time was not in accordance with the law. As I said, it represented murder.

All applications from across Dublin are now being sent to a central hub and are no longer being dealt with by community welfare officers. This has resulted in applications taking up to 12 weeks, or three months, to process and is causing great difficulty for the individuals involved. As the Taoiseach knows, most people moving out of homelessness just have the clothes on their back or a bag of clothes and do not have a stick of furniture. Is the Government aware of the changes resulting in the delay? Are there plans to address the issue?

She is in failing health. She has been seeking truth and justice since 1977 when her husband, Joe Campbell of the RUC, was shot dead in Cushendall, County Antrim. Her family and I believe that elements of the security forces conspired with UVF killer Robin Jackson to kill her husband when he uncovered evidence of collusion with paramilitaries. The inquest has been put back until January and the PSNI is still not prepared. Forty boxes of material have been gathered. The coroner is now proposing a clinic for locals in Cushendall to come forward with information because the RUC did not interview people, even those who were first on the scene. Special branch at the time knew there was a threat to Mr. Campbell but did not tell him. The amnesty legislation in Britain should not pass. Amnesty International has urged the Irish Government to take the UK Government to the European Court of Human Rights if this amnesty Bill is passed. Will the Taoiseach commit to doing that?

On 22 November, it wrote to parents to express the real challenge and difficulty the acting manager, Faye Reid, is faced with in delivering a service to almost 650 children who are on our waiting lists. I will read a snippet of the letter. It states:Cavan children's disability network team is currently undergoing a significant staffing crisis, which is impacting on the team's capacity to provide services to children and families. There are currently approximately 650 children and young people known to the Cavan CDNT, with around 22 therapy posts to meet this need. Of the 22 therapy posts available, there are approximately 12 posts currently vacant on the team. This is obviously having a huge impact on staff capacity to provide intervention and complete assessments. Current waiting times to access the team can be up to two years.I raised this last week with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. She kindly said she would meet the community healthcare organisation, CHO, management to address this. I ask the Taoiseach to put every resource behind this. We cannot have these kids waiting two years for any intervention.

It is not one of resources. Funding has been provided through the Department of Health to the HSE to provide for the recruitment of therapists, particularly in disability network teams. The HSE says it is having particular difficulties recruiting therapists for child disability services. We are not happy with the situation.

The council has done its due diligence, has handed over a 600-page report and has been clear with the Government that the transfer cannot happen without the proposed funding package being signed off. The Taoiseach is the middle man. Enough time has laboured on. The sites have deteriorated over the last few years and will deteriorate further. Earlier this year, the Taoiseach said that Clare County Council needed to get on with this. It has done so and has handed over its report. What is needed now are security and certainty for staff and their families and a future for these important cultural sites. What is needed is a commitment from the Taoiseach today to provide a timeline and deadline.

The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is engaging with local authorities in respect of this. The 600-page report looks like a hefty one. The issue is financial. The Taoiseach: Firstly, legacy is an important issue for all victims in Northern Ireland of the Troubles and their families who seek redress. Thereis a responsibility on all of those who carried murders on behalf othe state, those who carried murders on the behalf othe Provisional IRA and on behalf of loyalist paramilitaries; any issues of collustion should be followed through I believe that these centres will be a significant addition. The potential is there to advance and develop them to a greater extent perhaps than before.

The 68 bus is the only bus that serves the village itself. It is the only form of public transport into the village. It runs only about once an hour and of late it has not been reliable. On top of that, the express route for commuters was cancelled earlier this year without any notice. According to the National Transport Authority, NTA, the long-promised orbital route, the main benefit of which is that it would link Newcastle to Hazelhatch train station and Maynooth University, is not going to happen according for the foreseeable future because of a bridge built in the 1700s. That is hardly an unforeseeable challenge. Peamount Healthcare and many other places in the area are under-served. Public transport has not kept pace with the growth in Newcastle and the growth of businesses. What can the Taoiseach do about this?

Many Travellers are living in freezing caravans or mobile homes, some of which are more than 20 years old. The national caravan scheme was recently extended nationally, but a limit of 75 caravans was put on it. In the case of Galway, we need 24 replacement caravans but we were allocated four. As we come up to Christmas, it is a disgrace that people are sleeping in terrible, freezing conditions. I beg the Taoiseach to ensure that each person who needs a replacement caravan is given a loan under the caravan loan scheme to replace it and to do so between now and Christmas. There can be no delay on this. It is inhumane and degrading.

The agenda for the meeting will cover Russia-Ukraine, energy and economy, security and defence, and external relations. In his contribution this afternoon the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will address a number of the external relations agenda items including the southern neighbourhood. I will address all other issues. Before turning to the agenda of the European Council I would like briefly to update the House on my participation in the European Union-western Balkans summit which took place in Tirana, Albania yesterday. This was the first time that such a summit has taken place in the western Balkan region. It was historically symbolic to the wider European neighbourhood as a clear signal of the importance and investment that both the European Union and the western Balkans are making in our partnership. In advance of the summit the European Union drafted a declaration, the Tirana declaration, setting out our commitment to, and perspective on, our increasingly important political, economic and people-to-people relationship with the western Balkans, including currently as across our Continent we contend with and stand together in the face of Russia's illegal war on Ukraine. I am pleased that in the context of yesterday's summit, the six western Balkans leaders decided to align themselves with the Tirana declaration in a demonstration of growing shared interests, understandings and perspectives. Over the coming period I hope to see the leaders of the western Balkans working together additionally, supported by the European Union, to promote closer regional co-operation and to consolidate and strengthen regional peace across the western Balkans. This is the best way to advance the region's collective European Union perspective and the best basis for further prosperity, quality of life and opportunities across the region, in particular for youth. I would also like to inform the House on my planned participation in the European Union-Association of Southeast Asian Nations, EU-ASEAN, summit in Brussels next Wednesday, on the eve of the European Council. The summit will bring together European Union leaders and their counterparts from Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, marking 45 years of EU-ASEAN relations. We now enjoy a strategic partnership and will be progressing our shared plan under three pillars: political security, economic and socio-cultural. When we meet at the European Council next week, European Union leaders will again, as we have done on every occasion we have met since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, discuss our joint response to Russia's illegal, immoral and unjustifiable aggression. When we last met in October, we agreed that the European Union will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We remain united in our full support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders. It is now particularly pressing to intensify the provision of humanitarian and civil protection assistance to Ukraine, including in kind, and assist in the restoration of Ukraine's critical infrastructure to help people in Ukraine to cope this winter. Power and water facilities as well as other civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine have been deliberately targeted by Russian missile attacks and drone strikes. I condemn these cynical, inhumane and brutal actions without reservation. I am pleased that Ireland has been able to contribute equipment to support the electricity supply sector via the European Union civil protection mechanism.I am pleased also that the €25 million committed by the Government last month in institutional support for the stability of the Government of Ukraine to mitigate the impact of Russia's war will begin to be dispersed this month. Leaders will also discuss political and military support for Ukraine. I am hopeful that a ninth package of sanctions will be agreed before we meet. I have consistently supported the strongest possible sanctions and will continue to do so. There will be a particular focus in our discussion on the issue of accountability, including ways to secure accountability for the crime of aggression. Perpetrators must and will be held to account. We will also take stock of options to use frozen assets to support Ukraine's reconstruction and for the purposes of reparation. Russia's aggression has had a particular impact on neighbouring Moldova in a complex way, especially in respect of energy security. In response, the Government recently agreed €5 million in institutional support for the stability of the Government of Moldova to assist them and their people in tackling these challenges. In October, the European Council had a very important discussion on energy in the context of high prices and supply constraints. We will return to this issue again next week to provide further guidance for the period ahead. Of course, the most pressing issue facing citizens is the very high cost of energy. Governments across the Union have over the course of the year taken a range of measures to ease the burden on families and businesses. In November, the European Commission proposed a market correction mechanism which aims to protect citizens and businesses from excessively high gas prices. It is intended to address very high price peaks through a cap, in certain circumstances, on the prices of specific transactions on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, TTF. The details of this proposal are still being discussed, with EU Energy Ministers due to meet again next week to consider the matter further. Two other emergency regulations are close to finalisation and will provide for enhanced solidarity and better co-ordination of gas purchases and for the accelerated deployment of renewable energy. At our meeting, European Union leaders will discuss progress on this package of measures, which are aimed at bringing improved stability and predictability to the energy market. As I have emphasised previously, proposals in this area are complex and need to take into account differing national circumstances, energy mixes and security of supply. Our discussions will also include a focus on strengthening co-ordination ahead of next winter, and on ensuring that member states can work as effectively as possible together, over the course of next year, on issues such as gas demand aggregation, joint purchasing of gas and the efficient filling of gas storage facilities. We will also emphasise the importance of early preparation of contingency plans and reflect on planned deeper reforms of the European Union electricity market. We will also discuss economic issues more generally, with protecting households and businesses remaining our immediate priority, in particular the most vulnerable in our societies. We will re-emphasise the importance of a co-ordinated policy response across the Union, using all relevant tools at national and European Union level to enhance the resilience of our economies while preserving Europe's global competitiveness and the integrity of the Single Market. The European Commission launched the 2023 European semester cycle of economic policy co-ordination on 22 November with its presentation of the annual sustainable growth survey. This is informed by its latest economic forecast pointing to a much more challenging period for the European Union economy in the period ahead, following a relatively strong performance. The Commission is forecasting GDP growth falling to 0.3% in 2023, with inflation declining but remaining high at 7%. The latest indicators from Eurostat show euro area inflation moderating slightly, but still at 10% in November. The four priorities under the European semester remain promoting environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability, with a view to fostering competitive sustainability. It is the right emphasis at this time, reinforced by national recovery and resilience plans supporting the twin green and digital transitions. The Commission also adopted a communication on 9 November setting out orientations for a reformed European Union economic governance framework. The overall emphasis is on simplifying the fiscal rules, including through the use of the net expenditure path as the main operational indicator. While many specific details on how the new framework would work in practice remain to be ironed out, we see the Commission's communication as a solid starting point for these more detailed discussions by Finance Ministers in the period ahead. The European Council will take stock of work to implement the Strategic Compass. The focus is likely to be on ways to ensure more collaborative investments and joint procurement. The Strategic Compass, approved by the Foreign Affairs Council and endorsed by the European Council in March of this year, outlines the way forward for the EU in the field of security and defence over the course of the next ten years. The intention is to incentivise, through the award of EU grants, co-operation on a voluntary basis between interested member states for the common procurement of the most urgent and critical defence products. This kind of procurement co-operation is a particularly valuable opportunity for smaller member states such as Ireland. Spending on defence and security is a national competence and decisions in relation to increased funding for defence are, in the first instance, for each member state to decide for itself. At national level, the Government took a decision in June, based on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, to increase significantly spending on defence, rising from €1.1 billion to €1.5 billion in 2022 prices by 2028. This marks the largest increase in defence funding in the history of the Irish State. Leaders are likely to endorse a political decision to ensure the financial sustainability of the European Peace Facility, EPF, and a possible increase to the current ceiling for the facility given the unprecedented mobilisation to support Ukraine, with approximately 86% of the EPF ceiling, originally set for a period of seven years, now already committed. Discussions on the exact modalities of any increase are ongoing at official level and will continue at the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 December. Ireland has been strongly supportive of both the continued provision of EPF assistance to Ukraine and of the need to maintain the level of ambition in terms of preventing conflicts and building peace in other areas of the globe, particularly in Africa. The European Council will also hold a strategic discussion on transatlantic relations. The first EU-US summit in seven years took place on 15 June 2021, marking the beginning of a renewed transatlantic partnership. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council, which was established to co-ordinate approaches to key global trade, economic and technology issues and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations based on shared values, met for the third time earlier this week. The European Union and the United States are each other's most important trade and investment partner. Despite the impact of Covid-19, European Union and US companies traded goods and services worth €975 billion in 2020. The investment partnership is worth around €4 trillion. European Union companies in the US and US companies in Europe are together employing 9.9 million people and supporting many more jobs indirectly. Our shared goal is an effective and impactful complementary digital and green transition. In that context, the European Union has expressed reservations about the US Government's Inflation Reduction Act, and its potential to exclude European Union companies from the market at precisely the time we should be pulling together to manage the green transition. Next week will be an opportunity to discuss this issue and to endorse a way forward for Europe. I am keen in particular to see the joint taskforce established to look at issues with the US Inflation Reduction Act given space to progress its work. As I said at the outset of my remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address the remaining external relations issues on the agenda in his wrap-up statement later this afternoon.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	157	I begin by acknowledging the commitments offered in this House less than a week ago by the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, that the European Union remains committed to the Good Friday Agreement, that there will be no agreements with the British Government that will undermine the Irish protocol and that there would never be the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. These are very important assurances. They are assurances that point towards the strength of Ireland's position as we continue in our role of contributing at the heart of Europe. It also points to the strength and benefits which we accrue by being part of the European collective. However, the benefits and value of such are denied to our fellow Irish citizens north of the Border despite a majority voting to remain part of the EU. Today, for the fifth time since the election in May, the Assembly is to be recalled to elect a Speaker, as is required before it can function. Sinn Féin has worked with other parties in the North to recall the Assembly in order to form an Executive and release the promised support payment of £600, or almost €700, to help to alleviate the suffering of workers and families this winter. On each occasion, the DUP has chosen to oppose the election of a Speaker. Although it claims its protest is centred on the protocol, the reality is that the people of the North are being forced to endure an escalating cost-of-living crisis with an absence of political leadership from the DUP. It is wrong and unjust that the DUP is being allowed to continue to hold the economic well-being and welfare of the people of the North to ransom, particularly as efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the protocol continue in talks between the EU and the British Government. The DUP must come to its senses and end its senseless and heartless blocking of the support payment. It is wrong for it to be allowed to prevent the Assembly from functioning while talks are continuing. It is important that the EU has taken the necessary steps in recent weeks to augment its powers within the Brexit agreement which would allow it to respond in a robust manner if the British Government acts on previous threats to breach its responsibilities under that agreement. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated last week that a deal on the protocol was in reach if there was political will in Britain. Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, told EU and British parliamentarians at a meeting in Westminster that they were not worlds apart. He said the EU proposals would reduce checks on lorries to two or three a day. That gives cause for at least some optimism, albeit with the knowledge that despite this, and even though there appears to be a much more positive and encouraging tone emanating from the British Government on the protocol since Rishi Sunak, the new Prime Minister, took office in October, in real terms nothing has changed. We need to see this translated into action. We need to support our European colleagues as they continue to work towards securing a resolution to the difficulties with the British Government that will allow for a return of the Assembly working for the people in the North. Externally, the major issue in Europe remains the ongoing war in Ukraine. The priority must be to end the Russian invasion. Ending it and securing a total Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory will only happen through diplomacy and sanctions. Ireland must be a voice for peace, justice and freedom. Our total and unwavering solidarity is with the people of Ukraine at this deeply distressing and traumatic time for their country. Ireland understands more than most countries the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression. We know the importance of sovereignty and the right of self-determination. We also understand the importance and difficulty of finding peace. All Deputies are united in our condemnation of the actions of the Russian Federation. No country should be subject to the kind of military aggression that is bringing death and destruction to Ukraine. Ukrainian people continue to endure horrific suffering. Some 14 million Ukrainians have been forcibly displaced, with 7.8 million having sought refuge elsewhere in Europe. Martin Griffiths, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council yesterday that 17,023 civilians, including 419 children, have been killed, although he stated the real toll is far greater. Putin’s forces have carried out at least 715 attacks on healthcare facilities across Ukraine. Russia is intent on depriving Ukrainian civilians of access to healthcare. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed the Russian Government has attempted to turn cold into a weapon of mass destruction - an instrument of terror and submission. Ukraine has suffered the indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure which has left millions without access to heat, electricity, and water. As temperatures fall below freezing, the Ukrainian civilian population is facing a test of survival.  The efforts by Hungary to wield its veto to delay the signing-off of an EU package of €18 billion for Ukraine, in an attempt to pressure EU members into approving its share of the recovery fund, speaks to a lack of cohesion at the centre of Europe which undermines the cohesiveness of Europe's efforts to address the war in Ukraine. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has pointed to the difficulties of permanent members of the UN Security Council wielding their veto in respect of UN mandates, and the implications that has for the triple lock system. I believe Ireland and other EU member states have a job to do in addressing the difficulties relating to states such as Hungary employing their right to veto and, in effect, negating the capacity of the EU to respond fully and cohesively to what many are describing as the gravest security threat in Europe since the Cold War. Ireland must insist that attempts by Hungary to blackmail the EU are resisted. The EU is correct to insist that the necessary reforms be carried out by Hungary before the funds are released. It is a matter of concern that the Government has yet to draw down any moneys from the EU recovery fund. We are now lumped in with countries such as Hungary and Poland, which have not been able to draw down funds because of political issues.

These are badly needed funds which could help in a green transition, boosting regions and boosting our digital transition. The Government needs to get its act together in respect of the recovery fund. It is not acceptable that we are entitled to funds but they are not being accessed. I will finish by turning to the issues of the ongoing protests in Iran and the continuing persecution of the Palestinian people. The Taoiseach needs to bring to the EU Council a sense of the concern in Ireland not only at the death of Mahsa Amini, but also at the brutal suppression of legitimate protest that followed, which to date has resulted in the deaths of more than 530 people, including many children. In Palestine, at least 208 Palestinians, including 30 children, have been killed so far this year. The ongoing illegal forced evictions and demolitions and the expansion of illegal colonial settlements continue apace. Palestinians are in despair as the possibility of a two-state solution is simply disappearing before their eyes and those of the world. All of this is happening while the EU has preferential trade agreements with Israel, a state that is a serial violator of international law and many UN resolutions. Our history, legacy and record of neutrality demands that we be at the forefront of protest against the suppression of human rights, no matter where in the world it takes place. When will the Government stop relying on words and issuing statements that have no meaning? When will it start taking definitive action to raise these issues and impose sanctions on serial violators of international law and human rights?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	162	The Taoiseach is no longer present in the Chamber but I am aware this will be his last occasion to attend a meeting of the European Council as Taoiseach. I wish to mark the occasion and state that he has served his country very well in that regard. I have no doubt he will attend further Council meetings in another guise in the future. It is interesting that the issues dominating the agenda for this Council meeting are certainly not those he would have expected when he began his term as Head of Government two and a half years ago. The brutal invasion of Ukraine changed all. It has changed the European landscape, perhaps permanently so.Next week's agenda is still dominated by Ukraine and Russia, and the energy and economic consequences that affect everybody living not only on the Continent of Europe but internationally. I will mention a couple of the issues that will be debated, including the oil embargo that took effect last Monday. The cap on Russian oil suggested and now imposed, not only by the EU but other like-minded states, is $60 a barrel. I understand why that figure was picked. The EU has a contradictory double aim. One is to ensure that the tightest possible squeeze, in financial terms, is put on Russia to deny it, as far as we can, the capacity to wage war against Ukraine. The other is to ensure that there is an adequate fuel supply for the world. These are countervailing objectives that are sometimes hard to get into balance. The idea of the embargo was to ensure that Russian oil is restricted on the international markets, but the fears were that insurance and other European-provided supports would mean it would be impossible for Russia to sell oil anywhere and, therefore, the $60 cap came into being. Ukraine believes it is far too high and others argued against it. Further important decisions need to be made because there is an imperative, at the same time as squeezing Russia, to ensure that the citizens of Europe have access to fuel and heating for the winter months to come and beyond. We will need to return to this issue because it is quite clear to everybody that Putin's brutal war is not likely to come to an early end.  I will also mention the decision of Hungary and its Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to veto or delay the loan facility for Ukraine. Ukraine does has not have the capacity to raise its own taxes. For Hungary and Viktor Orbán to use that as a weapon in his own difficulties is quite shocking. We talked about the rule of law. There has to be some accounting. Member states are either signed up to the values of a common European Union or they are not. The notion that the will of the overwhelming majority of the people of Europe can be thwarted by one person acting vicariously, as Viktor Orbán has, is entirely unacceptable. I will also mention the meeting in Tirana yesterday. The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs met a variety of ambassadors representing all the applicant states. The Commission's enlargement package report, published in October, stated that the Commission recommended Bosnia and Herzegovina be granted candidate status. This was to be considered at the Council meeting this week. I did not see any reference to that decision in the Taoiseach's speech. The Minister of State might indicate during his contribution whether it is proposed that Bosnia and Herzegovina be given candidate status tomorrow. From talking to ambassadors from a variety of countries, especially off-piste, there is a growing frustration and alienation from European ideals because of constant delays.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	163	The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, addressed both Houses last week to mark our 50 years as members of the EU. I suggest, therefore, this is a good time to assess how the EU has performed over the past two and a half years since this Government came to office. During this time, the EU faced unprecedented challenges. In February 2020, Covid-19 arrived. This year, we had Russian's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine and all the associated problems that gave rise to. Of course, of importance to Ireland was the continued fallout from the Brexit vote in 2016, in particular, the need to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland through the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. On reflection, the EU did surprisingly well in responding to these crises. It cannot be easy to get agreement from all 27 member states, all with their different agendas, but agreements were reached and the EU came up with effective responses. As regards Covid-19, after an initial wobble, the Union was to the forefront in the development, manufacture and deployment of safe, effective vaccines. The EU digital Covid certificate was enacted and the recovery and resilience fund, unprecedented in its scope and design, was established to stimulate the economic recovery of Europe. The EU remains firm in its solidarity with Ukraine. An eighth round of sanctions has been agreed, along with many other measures, including agreed actions to tackle the energy crisis. The solidarity shown to Ireland concerning Brexit has been extraordinary. In all these discussions, Ireland has been at the heart of the negotiations and showed strong leadership, which, it seems, has been noted by the Commission President. The ongoing war in Ukraine becomes more horrific by the day. So far, it is estimated that up to 250,000 people have been killed. Of this, between 40,000 and 60,000 are believed to be civilians. Those figures were given to the House last week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. As winter snow and sub-zero temperatures arrive, fighting is now concentrated around the Donetsk region. Much of the country has been plunged into darkness as power plants and critical infrastructure are destroyed by Russian missile strikes. The EU, the G7 and Australia have agreed to cap the price of a barrel of Russian oil delivered by sea at $60. This is an attempt to hinder Russia's ability to pay for the war. It could also stabilise global energy prices. President Zelenskyy believes this is not enough. As we know, other member states have looked for a lower cap. It is, however, a start and something that should be kept under review and revisited as necessary. There is no doubt that war crimes are being committed by Russia in Ukraine and, therefore, I greatly welcome the proposal by the EU to set up a specialised court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute Russia's crimes of aggression. I look forward to learning more details about this initiative in due course. There have been eight rounds of EU sanctions so far. I am delighted to hear from the Taoiseach that a ninth round, it is to be hoped, will be agreed upon before next week. More than 100 entities and 1,200 individuals have been sanctioned. The European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, recently told our Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs that Ireland is among the member states with the highest value of frozen assets, amounting to €1.8 billion. These frozen assets, from Russia and its oligarchs, should be used for the benefit of Ukraine to reconstruct the country. It is estimated that the damage done to date to Ukraine amounts to €600 billion. According to the Commission, a number of legal and political questions arise in this regard but it is essential that every effort is made to resolve any perceived obstacles to achieve this objective. Staying with Ukraine, it is regrettable that Hungary has again used the veto, this time to block an €18 billion aid package for Ukraine. Ukraine desperately needs this money, given the crisis in the public finances there. Unfortunately, Hungary continues to be the bold child of Europe, with regard to its ongoing problems with the rule of law. Things cannot continue the way they are and, sooner or later, Hungary's relationship with the EU will have to be brought to a head. In the meantime, other ways to get this aid to Ukraine will have to be considered and finalised as soon as possible. The political situation in Iran continues to be a cause of serious concern. Mahsa Amini died in custody in September resulting in a wave of demonstrations across the country.The fundamental and inalienable rights of women and girls are central to these peaceful protests. The protests have been met with a brutal crackdown by the Iranian regime in an attempt to suppress the uprising. Reports suggest that more than 300 protestors have been killed, including more than 60 children. Imagine 60 children being killed as a result of this crackdown. More than 15,000 protestors have been arrested. Many more have been imprisoned and tortured, with some due to be executed. Fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are being trampled. As if that were not enough, it is clear that Iran is supplying drone weaponry to Russia for use in Ukraine, thus flouting the provisions of the Iranian nuclear deal. In response, the EU has correctly sanctioned a number of individuals and entities in Iran. The Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned the Iranian ambassador to Iveagh House in October to outline Ireland's strong position on these matters. However, there are plans to reopen the Irish Embassy in Iran following its closure in 2012. The editorial in The Irish Times of 25 November stated that Iran's was a regime in its final throes. Recent events suggest that it is coming to an end. In such circumstances, the Irish Embassy's reopening would send out all the wrong signals and, therefore, should not be proceeded with. The Ukraine crisis has sparked an energy crisis, necessitating an EU response. That is why I welcome last month's signing of contracts for the Celtic interconnector, which will link the national electricity systems of Ireland and France. It will be the first interconnector between Ireland and mainland Europe, come at a cost of €1.6 billion and be supported by EU funding. It will complement the overall objective of eliminating the EU's reliance on Russian fossil fuels and improving the security of our electricity supply. I look forward to the day when Ireland is in a position to export electricity to mainland Europe, having made the necessary investment to harness our offshore wind, which we have in abundance. I noted yesterday's EU summit on the western Balkans. For the first time, it was held in a western Balkan country. The region is of strategic importance and we need to speed up the accession process and help these countries implement their necessary reforms. Yesterday's summit agreed a number of financial assistance measures for the western Balkans. All of this will be helpful. In principle, Ireland supports enlargement and I hope that the accession process in respect of these countries can be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.

There is an ongoing crisis in the fishing industry around our coasts. Since it is almost a perennial crisis, it can sometimes be dismissed or brushed aside. We have an immense resource off our coasts. In the EU, only three member states are island states, those being, Ireland, Cyprus and Malta. In the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there are two Ministers of State, but not one of them focuses on fisheries and the marine, and it shows. Norway, which is not an EU member state, is looking for increased access to our waters to catch an even greater share of blue whiting. According to scientific studies, blue whiting stocks are in a healthy state. They represent a significant and vital resource for the Irish fishing industry. Currently, we get a quota of 3% of the blue whiting species in our own waters while Norway gets 18%, or six times more. Norway is now negotiating for even more. If this is accepted by our Government, I am told that it will be the final nail in our fishing industry's coffin. That is how serious the situation is. There must be an increased quota of blue whiting for the Irish fishing industry. If the above is not bad enough, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands have unilaterally increased their share of the mackerel quota. They have not based this move on any science. In some cases, they have built an industry where there was none previously. Mackerel is a migratory species. They spawn off the south west of Ireland and work their way up to those waters. They do not belong in any particular waters. We can agree a sensible way to share them. No agreement has been made between the EU and these three countries, which are not members of the EU or covered by the CFP. We are trading with them, yet there are no repercussions, particularly for Norway. I have great admiration for Norway and do not wish to speak critically of its people. In many ways, they have done great things, but they are out of order when it comes to fisheries. The EU is not standing up for Irish interests. We lost a large volume of our fisheries after Brexit. There was not a fair burden sharing. We were shafted. We will be down to one third of our fishing fleet soon. I will have a chance to speak with the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, later. Please, we need to sort out this issue. It is a serious threat to our industry.

I read through the Taoiseach's speech as it pertained to the topics covered by the European Council summit next week. Russia and Ukraine will of course be on the agenda, as will energy, the economy, security, defence and external relations. The Minister of State might clarify whether there will be a discussion on supporting the thousands of refugees to whom we should extend our warmest welcome. That the Taoiseach did not mention this was surprising. We cannot hide our heads under the counter where this issue is concerned and say that we cannot discuss it. We need to discuss it. This year, Ireland will take in 70,000 people seeking refuge from Ukraine and more than 12,000 applicants through the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, system, and rightly so. These people are here seeking sanctuary from horrors that I cannot even imagine. All the while, we are placing them in buildings that are not suitable for that purpose, although we must we must use every resource available to us in the first instance. We must discuss how the European Council and the EU more widely will support and demonstrate solidarity with member states. What extra supports can we access in providing for people's basic needs when they come to Ireland? Earlier, the House debated a motion on teacher shortages. These shortages would have been a problem at any time in the past decade, but are especially so now that we are taking in children who have arrived in Ireland after experiencing immense trauma. People need to access supports, and it is right and just that people who come here from Ukraine can begin working straight away, but what kind of childcare supports can they be provided with? If our EU partners are not demonstrating solidarity, what more pressing issue is there than the provision of sanctuary and all of the necessary resources? There were people in tents in Athlone who have just been moved out of them because of the cold, and abandoned ESB factories are being reopened. This is not even close to being good enough. In the absence of effective communication and leadership, a group of far-right nefarious individuals are disseminating fear and tapping into people's genuine fears. We need to be able to combat this. We need to work across the political divide and share resources and information to counter this scary situation.Yesterday, a group of residents in East Wall, an area that has experienced a high media profile in recent weeks, organised themselves to raise money to buy hats and scarves for people who came here through the international protection system. I have never witnessed a level of vitriol like this in my life. People trying to raise money to buy hats and scarves were being bombarded. I shared what happened on my Instagram account. I could not believe the responses. This was not from people whom I would cite as being bad, because people are inherently decent. They have, however, been manipulated and targeted through social media platforms, like Meta, where it is possible to tap into a genuine sense of fear and find it being said that these people are to blame for the wrongs of society. I would point at the Government in this regard, and it would point back. This situation, though, is scary. All the while, what is playing into this is Putin using refugees as pawns in his game. If we are not discussing this matter, then what are we doing? The refugees are being used as a tool of war. It is being played out on social media channels and targeted at the living rooms of Irish people and, I am sure, the rest of Europe. We seem to be burying our heads in the sand about this happening. Can we get this matter onto the agenda? It should be part of our response. There is a need for resources and better information.

It is interesting in the context of not just those items on the agenda but even those items that have slipped off it. Deputy Gannon made a good point regarding what is not on the agenda but that should possibly be there. The Covid-19 pandemic has slipped down the agenda to such an extent that it is not listed. I worry as well that while we are talking about external relations, security and defence, there is no explicit mention in the agenda of the crisis in the Horn of Africa. Perhaps it was ever thus, but what happens is that these crises seem to play out, we pay attention to them in real time and then, somehow, they slip out of our mind's eye as other things push in. It is not that these crises have been resolved but that we tend to forget about them. They have slipped down our agenda, which is not welcome. However, I welcome the Taoiseach's update on the EU's western Balkans summit. It causes us to cast our minds back to the foundation of the European project, which was as a peace project. It has been exceptionally successful in this regard. There is a history when it comes to the western Balkans. Having and strengthening this relationship with the EU can only be for the good in respect of fostering peace in that region. The agenda that will dominate, of course, is the single biggest international issue that must be addressed, which is Russia's illegal actions in Ukraine. Across so many contexts, we have seen how there has been a weaponising of human suffering. That has been seen in the movement of people, as Deputy Gannon mentioned, and it is a deliberate undertaking. We saw this being done from Belarus before ever the war was instigated. A deliberate attempt was then made to destabilise European democracies through the movement of people and the weaponisation of human misery. We are seeing it as well in the context of food in the Horn of Africa.  The worst consequences in this regard are playing out beyond the EU. The crisis in energy and energy prices is hitting hardest inside the EU. Now, the cold has been weaponised. There is a deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure aimed at depriving people of their hierarchy of basic needs. It is an attempt to try to take away their basic need to access shelter, heat and food. That is deliberate and we must call it for what it is. These are war crimes. In the longer term, we must have a conversation about how we can seek recourse to justice for what is happening. Deputy Haughey spoke about the specialised court. It will need to be resourced. We need to resource people in this regard now because we need evidence to be taken in real time. That will be a difficult conversation, but we will need to figure out how to prosecute those people responsible for the crimes we are seeing playing out. Energy and the economy are mentioned on the agenda. The need to reform our EU energy markets has never been clearer given how gas pricing works and the impact that is having on electricity prices all across the EU. This situation is also throwing into stark focus the need for us, as a country and as a Union, to move away from a reliance on petrostates. These may not have a track record on human rights or may not share our value system, yet we find ourselves funding their economies, societies and states through our use of fossil fuels. This brings home to us this need for us to move to energy independence and to accelerate the renewables revolution under way. We understand Ireland's potential in this regard but, equally, that we must also be part of a European framework when we undertake this process. In this regard, the launch of the Celtic interconnector is important in the context of attaching our renewable energy resources to a wider European system. We must take this and build it up. We must move towards having a European super grid to address the intermittency we get in wind power here is balanced, for example, by solar energy production further south in Europe. We should build a resilient system that is going to serve everybody across our Continent. I have a nagging worry about the continuing focus on GDP growth. We understand now that we must move away from an economic model that couples progress with measures such as our emissions outputs. Measuring just by GDP, though, and the throughput of economies is also not going to be fit for purpose as we move into a future where we must consider a decarbonising agenda. We must move more towards aspects such as well-being and a circular economy. The slavish adherence to just GDP growth measures is not going to cut it in this regard. I mentioned my worry that the crisis in the Horn of Africa is falling off the radar. The same thing happened concerning the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver. This issue has also not been resolved. It has just slipped down the agenda until it has disappeared off the bottom. As a result, we still see low vaccination rates across the developing world. Maybe it was ever thus, but we must have an eye to the future as well. There was a welcome move at COP27 in respect of a loss and damage facility. Movement was also made on climate financing. We must, however, consider issues such as intellectual property rights in respect of the roll-out of green technologies. Countries in the developing world will have to leapfrog fossil fuel development. We cannot just have a situation where we say to those countries that they are allowed to develop their economies but that they must use the same technologies we did and add to emissions profiles as a result. There will be great technical developments in these areas and there should be a suspension of intellectual property rights in the case of many of these technologies so developing countries can have access to them as well. As other Deputies have done, I conclude on the actions of Hungary and its blocking of the €18 billion in EU aid for Ukraine. European solidarity in the face of this Russian aggression is of pivotal importance. For a state within the Union to use the bargaining chip of European solidarity for its own ends has been termed a low point in Hungarian foreign policy and I am forced to agree with that.

Israel, an apartheid terror state, makes that community an area of terror and fear for anybody who happens to be Palestinian in their homeland. Two weeks ago, apartheid forces dragged children from a primary school in Masafer Yatta to make way for bulldozers. It is another example of a community being ethnically cleansed from their homeland by apartheid Israel. This school was funded by the European Union, yet the EU says nothing. Since last week, more than ten Palestinians have been murdered in the occupied West Bank. In some of these cases, which the Minister of State may have seen them, people were executed in cold blood for all to see. International law means nothing to Israel. Unfortunately, the European Union, of which Ireland is a key member, is unwilling to hold Israel to account. With the Taoiseach's term coming to an end this month, what message has Ireland brought to European Council meetings condemning Israeli apartheid? Has the Taoiseach ever taken concerns raised on countless occasions in this House to those Council meetings? Has the Government ever raised concerns about Israel defying international law at European Council meetings? During the term of this Taoiseach and the Minister of State, 500 Palestinians have been murdered by Israel. Apartheid Israel has murdered 500 people on their watch. Of those, 100 were children. Has the Minister of State ever raised this issue in the European Council? Has he condemned Israel at European Council meetings? One hundred of the 500 people murdered by apartheid Israel were children. This year, 2022, is set to be the deadliest year in the occupied West Bank since records of killing began in 2005. Israel is a terror state. There is administrative detention and no right of return. Stealing Palestinian land on a daily basis is sanctioned by the state. There are illegal settlements and shoot-to-kill policies, as we saw as recently as last week. There is daily racism. Civil society organisations have been designated as terror groups by Israel. There is daily apartheid and Israel maintains the biggest open-air prison in the world, namely, the Gaza Strip. Israel is getting more and more belligerent. Religious extremists have key roles in the new government. What action has Ireland taken against Israel and the crimes it commits? With Ireland's term on the UN Security Council coming to an end, what has Ireland done to say we object to Israeli terror?

Is illegal occupation different if it takes place in different countries? Are systematic abuses of human rights different if they take place in different countries? Are crimes against humanity different if they take place in different countries? I would say most people would answer "No" to those questions. Abuses of human rights are abuses of human rights. Crimes against humanity are, as the words suggest, crimes against any of humanity. War crimes are crimes committed anywhere using war and aggression. Illegal occupation is illegal occupation, regardless of where it takes place. It seems the Irish Government and the European Union have a totally different view on that. There have been nine rounds of sanctions against Russia as part of an absolutely justified condemnation of illegal aggression, murder, illegal occupation, human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. The very same things are happening every day in Palestine and there is not one round of sanctions. Not only have there been no sanctions but there are preferential trade agreements. Europe is Israel's biggest trading partner, with €31 billion of trade. The United States, which was also mentioned favourably in the Taoiseach's speech, this week specifically insisted that the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh should not be referred to the International Criminal Court, ICC, as a crime. It specifically said it should not. Mr. Ned Price, a spokesperson for the State Department, stated, "We maintain our long-standing objections to the ICC’s investigation into the Palestinian situation". The official position of the United State is that whatever it does, we must not investigate Israel's crimes against the Palestinians. What does the Minister of State think of that? What does the Government think about its allies and friends in Washington insisting we do not look into the crimes committed by Israel in the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh? What is the Government's official response to the reports of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International condemning Israel for apartheid, crimes against humanity, the siege of Gaza and so on? What is the official position of the Government on what we will do about that? What has the Government asked the European Union to do about that? What has the Government demanded in response to the specific request in the recommendations of that report that there should be sanctions in terms of selling weapons or defence-security trade with Israel that in any way facilitates, perpetuates or supports the apartheid regime in its prosecution of crimes against humanity? What is the Government's official response? What is the European Union saying? The answer is "Zero, zilch." Has the Minister of State seen the video of the cold-blooded execution of Ammar Mefleh in the past week in Huwara, a town south of Nablus? Has the Minister of State seen it? It shows a man shot in cold blood by the Israelis? I have seen it. It is horrendous. The middle eastern representative of the UN described with absolute shock what he was looking at, stating it had to be investigated. There was not a word in the Taoiseach's speech. Does he honestly believe that anybody can credibly give credit to the humanitarian pretensions or the pretensions to being a force for peace or a force driven by principle rather than strategic self-interest if he remains silent about that? Of course, in some ways the agenda is given away when one sees us being evaluated by NATO in Cork. I thank the Minister for the reply in which he stated that we have made a voluntary decision to be evaluated by NATO. I got this letter. It is quite extraordinary voluntarily deciding to be evaluated by NATO. Of course, in that, we see the real agenda.

I look forward to the European Council meeting next week and I am grateful, in expectation, for the Minister of State reply to this round of statements. As much as these discussions every month change, they also stay the same. That is why I probably will ask for a similar update to those I have sought in other weeks, as other Deputies have. The issue of concern for me relates to the supposed Hungarian veto of the aid package agreed by other EU member states for Ukraine. This is extremely worrying.It has been one of a litany of worrying moves by the Hungarian Government. This has been the case when it comes to rule of law in its own country for close to a decade at this stage. In recent months in particular, it has included Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and the response in support of the Ukrainian people and EU funding more generally. This is with regard to EU funding going externally to assist the people of Ukraine who are being savaged by Putin's war machine, as opposed to EU funding going internally to the people of Hungary to help them deal with so many issues that are arising. It is the political decision of what is an increasingly odious regime to stand in the way of respite for its own people as well as the people of Ukraine. My question, and perhaps the Minister of State can touch on it in his response, is what are the other 26 member states going to do? How will they be able to push in a way and in a manner that, most importantly, continues to support the Ukrainian people and ensure the values and principles of the European Union are maintained? This is not the first time we have spoken about other Article 15 issues and not only against Hungary. We speak about Poland and the very clear changes that were made domestically there in response to the collective pressure of the European Union. It is a rules-based organisation and those rules need to be respected internally and given attention by member states. Another area for the agenda for the meeting next week is, of course, continuing discussions on collective security and defence. This can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. It is something from which Ireland cannot simply walk away. We have a responsibility and, most importantly, a vested interest in the continuing security of the European Union in its entirety. This is crucial in terms of our own jurisdiction and the island as a whole, be it with regard to cybersecurity, aerospace or maritime activity. With regard to EU training missions for Ukrainian forces, has any further decision been made on Irish Defence Forces activity or participation in training missions that obviously would not breach any notion of military neutrality? I was struck by an image circulating on social media today of a Ukrainian truck that was blown up by a land mine. The truck was being driven by two members of the Ukrainian defence forces who sadly lost their lives. They were killed by a landmine planted by Russian soldiers. It was a bread truck. They were delivering bread to starving people and it was blown up by a landmine. It is the very type of landmine our Defence Forces have a particular skill and expertise in identifying and clearing. They could train people to identify and clear landmines so that civilian actors, be they individuals or people delivering bread to starving children, can be helped. I ask that every effort be made so we contribute progressively to the training mission to deal with instances such as this.

She spoke about Ireland's pivotal role in Europe and how history has helped shape a nation of innovators and creators. It is a nation very much at the heart of the European experience and journey. As one of the most influential and motivational European leaders of our time, her comments resonated with the entire nation. They were timely and extremely well received. Our European experience has taught us the value of role models. An Taoiseach and the Minister of State have led us on our European adventure with courage and conviction since coming to office. At every opportunity, An Taoiseach and the Minister of State have rightly reinforced our commitment to the European Union throughout our time in government. This is to be commended. It is very much a benchmark and statement of intent for modern Ireland and a progressive Ireland that we are seen as modern Europeans. As President von der Leyen rightly said last week, our European experience allows us to stand tall and proud and reflect on our achievements and pivotal role as true leaders in the most progressive and inclusive union the world has ever seen. The EU is a union of equals, one that affords opportunity for all. Crucially, it provides a shoulder of solidarity and support for those countries facing strife and persecution. In particular, I commend the Minister of State and An Taoiseach for forcibly articulating our support for the people of Ukraine throughout the ongoing struggle. I look forward to their continuing this staunch support in the coming months. President von der Leyen spoke to the importance of leaders and role models in modern Europe. As we look to the end of the current Taoiseach's term, it is only right and proper that we acknowledge what have been his considerable efforts on our behalf at EU level. I commend him on this. There are many pressing engagements for us at the European Council and the Minister of State has heard many of the views articulated. When we go to the European Council we should not forget the words of President von der Leyen last week. She spoke of our emergence as a small nation but a mighty force on the European stage for good and for effecting change. As we reflect on her comments this week, which is the centenary of our emergence as a free nation, we will see it very much as a statement of progress for the country and how we have evolved. Not only have we emerged as a free nation but we have also emerged as a pivotal force for good in Europe. The Minister of State and many others who are driving our needs, wants and aspirations at EU level need to be commended.

In the same period, they have risen by only 18% in Europe. Last year, investment funds purchased one in ten second-hand homes and one in four apartments in the State. In Berlin the Government is taking homes back from investment funds and ridding the city of the cuckoo and vulture funds. There are 166,000 vacant homes in the State. Almost 50,000 of them have been vacant for longer than six years. In France there is a high-charge incremental vacant home tax that saw a 13% reduction in vacancy. This is the equivalent of 21,580 properties in this State if we were to do something similar. We are in a housing emergency. This is a disaster and people are in crisis. Throughout Europe there are solutions if the Minister and the Taoiseach were willing to look. Instead, while he and the Taoiseach are in Brussels shaking hands and speaking to people about all of the great meetings they have had over the past two years, 4,000 children will sleep in emergency accommodation this Christmas. Before the Minister of State and the Taoiseach go off to Europe and off into the distance, they should remember that housing is the number one issue. If they can do it in Europe, why in the name of God is the Government not looking at solutions and bringing them home? These are a few examples of what they could and should be doing.

The people of Ireland accept that Israel is an apartheid state. We know that it engages in the annexation of Palestinian lands. We know about the illegal settlement. We know about the crimes against humanity, the executions and all the rest. It is fair to say there has been an abject failure at European level to call out Israel for what it is, namely, an apartheid terrorist state. There is a requirement for this to be done. If we cannot get agreement on doing what is necessary at European level, it means there is a greater impetus or pressure on us to do what is right. There is a need, and whether it is the occupied territories Bill or recognising the state of Palestine, it needs to happen. What happened to apartheid South Africa was that it became a pariah state. It is absolutely necessary. I seek further information from the Taoiseach or Minister of State on where the conversations in Europe will go regarding further moves to deal with the energy markets. Beyond that, what technical capacity are we offering to try to combat what the Russians are doing as regards using cold as a weapon of mass destruction? If I could get an update at the end of the debate, I would appreciate it.

It will be the final European Council meeting the Taoiseach will attend as Taoiseach and I wish him the best of luck in that regard. I welcome a number of recent events. President von der Leyen's address to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas last week was very good in terms of both content and delivery. I welcome her cast-iron commitment that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. That has been the long-standing EU position, but it is good that it is reinforced consistently. It is great to have people of President von der Leyen's stature in Ireland's corner. I welcome the holding of the EU-western Balkans summit in Tirana yesterday. It is a very positive step and I am surprised more meetings have not taken place because there are six quite fragmented and fragile countries of the Balkans which neighbour the EU. All we have to do is look at what happened in the mid-1990s to recognise that there is an issue and that these countries could do with the stability and influence of the European Union. I encourage the EU to at least get its house in order to ensure these countries are granted candidate status, where appropriate, as soon as possible. The holding of the EU-ASEAN summit next week is a good thing. There are nine countries in Asia that want to establish a link with the European Union, and having a strategic partnership that takes trade and human rights into consideration is a good way to go. What can we say about Ukraine that has not already been said? I utterly condemn what is going on there. As the Russian military is failing on the battlefield, it is now targeting civilian infrastructure, particularly that which supports life such as water and power. This is a ruthless way of doing business coming into winter. I welcome Ireland's support for Ukraine in providing €25 million recently and also the €5 million we have given to Moldova. I had the good opportunity to speak to the deputy ambassador of Moldova last night and he asked me to convey his heartfelt gratitude to the Irish people, which I am happy to do. It is good to see that Ireland is not forgetting, ignoring or neglecting other small countries in eastern Europe. This is a very positive development. On defence and security, the Taoiseach said there are proposals to look at a common EU mechanism for purchasing military equipment. I appreciate there are differing views on this in the House but, on balance, it is good for Ireland and other small countries. This country has agreed to consider procuring a primary radar system from a passive point of view in order that we can monitor our airspace. It would be very expensive and could cost between €50 million and €80 million depending on the model chosen. There are several other big-ticket items, such as a ship to replace LÉ Eithne, which could cost up to €200 million, and possibly a transport aircraft. Through common procurement, we could get a 10% or 15% discount on the cost of these big-ticket items. As we will have to get them anyway, it makes perfect sense if we can spend the money saved elsewhere. I very much welcome participation of the Defence Forces in the mine clearance operation. They have excellent expertise in that area and it important such expertise is put to good use. Unfortunately, there was a mine strike incident in Yemen this morning. Members may not be aware of that. Thankfully, retired Irish Army Major General, Michael Beary, was not injured in the blast when the vehicle he was in drove over a mine. The armoured land cruiser was almost completely destroyed. I am very happy to hear that neither he nor anyone else in the convoy was injured. I wish him a full and speedy recovery. It reminds us of the scourge of landmines in contaminated areas. Anything Ireland can do to help Ukraine in relation to improvised explosive devices and landmines is something we should certainly pursue. I welcome the agenda of the European Council meeting next week and extend my best wishes to the Irish negotiating team.

The reason is that the price of Russian crude oil was already below $60 per barrel when the cap was announced. These are more games. The people are sick and tired of this. Here we go again with statements on the European Council meeting, where the Ministers will go out and honour their European globalist friends.

The Minister of State is as good as any of the rest of them. It is what the Government wants and not what the people of Ireland want. People can see through this. We have an educated electorate who, thankfully, can see every move the Government makes. Every time the Government's EU globalist friends ask the Government to jump, it asks "How high?". We saw it last week during the address of President von der Leyen, whom we all welcomed. Why was she here? It was more virtue signalling and talking up the great European Union. Where were our friends during the banking bailout? They proved it that time. I was in the same party as the Minister of State at the time. He voted for the bailout but I did not.

It was an absolute clean-out of the Irish people, in which we took on 42% of the total EU debt. As I said to President von der Leyen, major banks and institutions from her country shovelled the money into Ireland and left us to pay back the debt for all the countries. It was the biggest mistake we ever made. The price cap comes at a time when global oil prices have dropped dramatically due to the weakening global economy, ongoing lockdowns in China and OPEC's decision to maintain steady levels of oil production. We can all see it with our eyes and, thankfully, there is some relief at the pumps. The games are going on but they should be over as far as I am concerned. Members of the Government will go to the European Council meeting next week and God knows what they will sign up to regarding Ukraine and any other place, with no consultation with the people. However, when they come back and meet the people, beidh siad ag fanacht libh. The people will be waiting in the long grass for them and will teach them that they should be representing the Irish people and not the European globalists.

Much of Europe, particularly countries in the former Soviet Bloc, relied on Russian gas for the generation of electricity, home heating, cooking and industrial purposes. Germany and Italy, the largest and third largest economies, respectively, in the eurozone, were also heavily dependent on Russian gas. Ireland is almost exclusively reliant on the generosity of strangers based in the UK, which is struggling to keep the supply of energy up with demand. We lost a massive opportunity. I do not necessary blame all members of the Government for what has happened, but the Minister of State knows as well as I do that a major opportunity was lost with Shannon LNG. We had a great system in place. In 2016, the previous Government, in its programme for Government, supported a liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility in the Shannon region. However, due to the Green Party input in 2020, that was thrown out the window because it demanded that it be thrown out. We have seen the craziness of following the Green Party in some of its folly. I refer to what was said last week about the car park. We used to have a massive car park in Leinster House off Merrion Square but some genius decided we should tear it up and put down a big lawn that we have to cut and maintain. It was a fine car park. We are renting parking spaces for staff and others since and we have to pay for them. When I say "we" I mean the taxpayer has to pay for it. Now, the Green Party leader is saying we should do away with parking out there altogether. Oireachtas staff, Members and everybody associated with the workings of this House should disappear our cars, put them somewhere else and make our way in to the Houses by foot or on bicycle. That is not practical or sensible. Why am I highlighting this issue? Would the Minister of State like to rely on a person who comes out with such a statement to support Shannon LNG, a sound sensible proposal to give us surety of energy supply? He is a man who is trying to take away the car parking spaces from underneath us.It is crazy, gaga, stupid, insane, mental-ness. It needs to be called out for what it is.

I will make no apologies for asking him and the Government to raise their voices to use our neutrality in the most positive way possible. Last Saturday, I awoke to news headlines saying that Biden did not think the conditions were right to talk peace. We have to raise our voice to talk for peace with regard to the war in Ukraine and all the other wars causing misery, death, destruction and starvation. On the same day that Biden said the conditions were not right, the same news bulletin told us that the United States had unveiled its latest hi-tech strategic bomber. The Minister of State might listen for that alone. A B-21 bomber is capable of carrying a nuclear payload and can be flown without a crew on board. This is for the new generation. The US is missing the point that with nuclear bombs, there is no new generation. This was on the same day that Biden said the conditions were not right for peace. Does the Minister of State know how much the United States will spend on each plane? It will spend $750 million to fly it without a pilot and to have dual capacity for nuclear and regular bombs for the new generation. It will buy 100 of those. I ask the Minister to take that on top of the comments of Josep Borrell who semi-apologised for telling us everything outside of Europe is a jungle. In fact, he did not apologise at all and instead added to the analogy that everything outside Europe is lawless. That is the Europe we have become. I am a proud European with intimate family connections with Europe. I talk today in the context of the agenda that is coming up next week about security and external relations in our southern neighbourhood. I put it in context: 25,313 people died or went missing between 2014 and 2022 in the Mediterranean and an additional 950 people are recorded as dead or missing since 2004. The total number of people dead or missing in Europe and the Mediterranean is 26,218 people. All data are from the Missing Migrants Project. I mention that not to say that one death is worse than another, but to emphasise that this is all part of fortress Europe and building up what Borrell wants - a garden inside of walls, physically and metaphorically speaking, with a jungle outside. That is what the European project has become. We have twisted language on its head. We have taken our concept of neutrality - a principle that we hold dear, which has served us well and allowed us to get membership of the Security Council, albeit on a temporary basis, and to be a trusted voice in the world - and we have stretched that to the point where elasticity has no meaning anymore. We have joined a Ukraine defence contact group. The meetings have taken place in NATO headquarters and Ireland has participated in six of them. Time precludes me from going through the bullet points with regard to them. The EU military assistance mission has also been stretched beyond capacity. We talk about neutrality meaning something, except when very senior spokespeople tell us it is a policy decision as to whether we lose our neutrality or the triple lock. I will use my voice for as long as I can to say this must stop being done in our name. The overwhelming feedback from all the polls is that people wish us to use our voice as a neutral country for peace in the world, not to add to more militaristic states. That is exactly what has happened. The European project has been transformed from a peace project into a military project and a huge industrial-military complex. I was sickened to read about the amount of money we are spending through the European project on military spending. Some of the budgets - there is a whole list of them - have increased thousandfold while something like 800 million people are on the verge of starvation. The rich G7 countries are telling us that. When I see that the agenda for next week's meeting covers Ukraine and Russia, energy and economy, security and defence, the southern neighbourhood and external relations, I want to know where our independent voice is. That voice is needed to point out, as friends should do for one another, that the wrong track is being taken. That is what friends do; they talk honestly and openly to their friends to ask them to change because what they are doing is causing death and destruction. I do not know what the shake of the Minister of State's head means but I am out of time and he is lucky.

As the Taoiseach said less than an hour and a half ago, spending on defence and security is a national competence. Decisions on that are, in the first instance, for each member state to decide on. We decide on our military spending. Dáil Éireann decides on our military spending. Nobody in Brussels or NATO is telling us what to do with our military forces. We decide that in this Dáil. These conspiracy theories about some kind of militarisation happening in the EU need to be put to an end. It is our decision only in this Dáil. It is nobody else's decision. The EU has been a tremendous force for peace, social progress and economic prosperity in this country and throughout the EU. I reject the characterisations from Opposition Deputies of the left and the far left, or most of them, as being completely out of touch with the reality of the opportunities the EU has offered to us.

Deputy Mattie McGrath should look into the origins of those conspiracy theories. The agenda for next week's meeting of the European Council will be discussed by European affairs ministers at the General Affairs Council next week in Brussels, which I will attend. I will focus, as the Taoiseach has said, on a number of external relations issues which are on the agenda of the December European Council. The Council sets general policy among the leaders to the European institutions. I know it is right and proper for people to raise the issue of Brexit and the protocol but they are dealt with every single day of the week at other levels of the European Union. I suspect it would come to the leaders if there was a conclusion to the negotiations and, indeed, if there was a major problem. It is a feature rather than a flaw of the process that neither Brexit nor the protocol is on the agenda. Many people within the European system and our system are dealing with that issue on a regular basis. Some of the other external relations issues mentioned here today are similar, including the Israel-Palestine issue, in that they have been raised by Ireland on numerous occasions. I reject some of the language that has been used in this House about Israel but I am not saying there are no problems there. However, those issues and problems have been raised by Irish Ministers, including the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the UN and the Foreign Affairs Council. Deputy Ó Cathasaigh mentioned the Horn of Africa and he is right to do so. It has also been discussed by ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council. The issue of Ethiopia was discussed by foreign ministers most recently in October. As the Taoiseach said, EU leaders will have a strategic discussion on relations with the southern neighbourhood. EU co-operation with the southern neighbourhood takes place in the framework of European neighbourhood policies and comprises ten partner countries around the Mediterranean. It is a timely discussion. In February 2021, the EU launched the new agenda for the Mediterranean. The agenda focuses on five policy areas: human development; good governance; the rule of law; resilience; prosperity and digital transition; and peace and security. Migration, as Deputy Connolly has rightly mentioned, is on the agenda, as is mobility, the green transition, climate resilience and energy. Thematic priorities for 2022 included food security and energy, in light of the regional impact of the war in Ukraine, and the need for an accelerated green energy transition. The agenda also provides for the EU to use all tools at its disposal to bring operational and financial support to southern partners in the area of migration and mobility, with the strengthening of migration and asylum governance, including border management capacity, as key elements. EU financing for the agenda is drawn from the neighbourhood development instrument and an indicative amount of €7 billion is earmarked for 2021 to 2027. Ireland recognises that supporting a stable, prosperous and democratic southern neighbourhood is in all of our interests. For that reason, it is committed to working with its EU and southern neighbourhood partners to address the shared challenges of the Euro-Mediterranean region. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, recently represented Ireland at the fourth EU southern neighbourhood ministerial meeting, which took place in Barcelona on 24 November. Next week, I will attend the General Affairs Council which will continue the preparations for the European Council. As Deputy Howlin mentioned, we are likely to discuss Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Commission has recommended candidate status on the understanding that certain steps will be taken, including eight substantial reforms. Ireland has consistently expressed strong support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU perspective and the granting of candidate status, so I will support that at the General Affairs Council on behalf of Ireland. I hope that will proceed apace. That implies there is work to do with the Bosnians, which we will certainly help them with. Candidate status was recently given to Ukraine and Moldova too. Similar conditionality relating to reforms could apply to Bosnia. This would send a positive signal to the Government and people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. When leaders last met, they condemned the unjustifiable and unacceptable use of force by Iranian authorities against peaceful protestors, particularly women, and welcomed the restrictive measures the EU adopted against the perpetrators of these serious human rights violations. Leaders called on Iran to stop the violent crackdown against peaceful protestors immediately and to release those detained, with full respect for civil rights. Foreign ministers will discuss this when they meet next week at the Foreign Affairs Council. The fact that many issues raised by colleagues are not on the European Council agenda does not mean they are not on some other important European agenda where day-to-day decisions are taken. Day-to-day decisions are not made at the European Council. Deputy Gannon said that discussion of refugees should be on the agenda for the European Council. I can confirm, with the present draft conclusions, that the issue of displaced persons from Ukraine, both within and outside Ukraine, is on the agenda as part of the discussion about Ukraine. It may not have seemed obvious. Leaders will not discuss it at the level of detail that deals with the genuine issues that Deputy Gannon raised but the issue of refugees will certainly be on the agenda. I totally reject what Sinn Féin said when comparing us with Hungary and Poland with regard to the recovery and resilience funding. It is completely incorrect. We are not the only country not to have drawn down funding but our plan was approved some time ago. It has not led to the type of discussions that have taken place in Poland in advance of its approval and indeed in Hungary, which is a discussion it raised itself with regard to the veto issue. Our plan did not have those issues. It is absolutely wrong for Sinn Féin to make that comparison during this particular debate. A number of colleagues have paid tribute to the Taoiseach for the work he has done at the European Council. When one sees it up close, it is an important function of the Taoiseach, because when he goes to the meeting, he is in a room on his own with no officials. Nobody else is in the room when they make those key decisions. He has shown, in the decisions that the European Council has had to make, particularly with regard to recovery and resilience funding in the five-day summit in July 2020, the issue of vaccines, and Ukraine, that he is a leader at those European Council meetings. He has an excellent rapport with his colleagues, which can be heard in what they say about him and in other comments about his positive contributions to European Council meetings. I have no doubt that his influence will continue. I pay tribute to him. Somebody will report after the next European Council meeting too. I think I can say of everybody from Ireland, such as the Taoiseach and I, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and whoever else goes to European Council meetings, to a meeting of a Council of Ministers, or to the European Parliament, that they always have Ireland in first place on their agenda. Ireland's place is in the European Union. We have more power around that table when we share the power with all the member states. It has brought incalculable benefits to this country with regard to our economy and society. The idea that Deputy Mattie McGrath keeps positing, that there is some sort of conspiracy and that we are simply doing what we are told, is nonsense. The European Union has certainly pushed Ireland in certain directions but we should never forget what the European Union is. It is leaders and Ministers sitting around a table, the MEPs and the Commission. Irish people, including the Taoiseach, have played a huge role in driving that European Union agenda, benefiting us and benefiting the entire European Union.

At the start of Committee Stage on this Bill I flagged I would be bringing a set of amendments on Report Stage. One set of amendments deals with amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Act and another set merges the right to request remote working proposal into the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. We have been advised the first set of birth information and tracing amendments must be recommitted to Committee Stage and this is the purpose of this motion. We are advised the right to request remote working amendments do not require the Bill to be recommitted so my contribution is going to focus on the information and tracing amendments but I will also briefly address the right to request remote working element as well. I am bringing forward an amendment to the Birth Information and Tracing Act under the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. The landmark passage of the Birth Information and Tracing Act through these Houses represented a long overdue recognition of rights of access to a person's own information. For the first time in the history of the State adopted persons have a clear and guaranteed right of access to their identity information, including information which is also the personal data of another person and certain defined categories of third-party information. It also allows for access to information by a child of a relevant person where their parent has died and for access by the next of kin of children who died in an institution. This level of guaranteed access is not possible under established data protection law, such as the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and this is what makes the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 ground-breaking in nature. The new law establishes a robust tracing service and a contact preference register, as well as a range of new bespoke measures to address issues arising for people affected by illegal birth registration. A bespoke website, www.birthinfo.ie went live on 1 July. The contact preference register provided for under the Act was established on 1 July. The register enables people affected to register their preference for contact, the level of contact preferred or indeed no contact. Since opening, almost 3,000 new contact preferences have been registered, both within Ireland and from abroad. The Adoption Authority of Ireland has identified 194 matches to date and is engaging directly with individuals to support their preference for contact. As of 5 December, a total of 5,847 applications for information have been received by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland. In addition, a total of 2,597 applications for tracing have been made. The initial surge of demand for services under the new Act presents some significant challenges for the two bodies in processing the huge number of applications received. Both Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland are working hard to process applications for information and, to date, information has been released to 558 individuals. Each week, more and more people are receiving their information and finding answers to long-held questions.Last week, I received two separate emails from individuals who had received their birth name for the very first time using the provisions of the Act. It is delivering for the people we passed it for. Regarding the amendments proposed, Tusla has identified one technical enhancement to the Act that would further support delivery of information services under the legislation. The intention of the amendment is to enable Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland to conduct a trace in circumstances where an application has been made and it is necessary to establish if the persons listed as parents on the birth certificate or birth information are deceased. This verification trace would be automatic on receipt of an application and would not require a qualifying person to request the trace or the Minister to direct or consent to the trace. Currently, under Part 3 of the legislation a qualifying person, that is, the child of a deceased relevant person, can receive the birth and early life information of their deceased parent in circumstances where the parents named on the birth certificate of the relevant person are also deceased. In order to establish that the grandparents in question are deceased, Tusla would benefit from being able to avail of the tracing powers provided for in Part 5 of the Act. Part 4 provides that a qualifying relative, that is, the next of kin of a relevant person who died as a child while resident in a mother and baby or county home institution, can obtain the birth and early life information of their deceased relative. While parents will automatically receive this information on application, in the case of a qualifying relative who is not a parent of the relevant person, the information may only be released where the parents named on the birth certificate are deceased. In order to establish that the parents named in the records are deceased, it would be useful for Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to have the authority to avail of the tracing powers provided for under Part 5 of the Act. The amendment supports the primary purpose of the Act and will ensure the release of information in all cases where it is available. As I indicated on Committee Stage, the work life balance Bill now includes an amendment that will give a right to request remote working to all workers. The right to request flexible working remains limited to parents and carers. The main changes to the Bill arising from this are the introduction of a statutory code of practice which will govern both flexible and remote working requests, and a requirement for employers to have regard to the code when considering remote working requests. This means that all requests for remote and flexible working will be considered under one piece of integrated legislation, simplifying the process for employers and employees and reducing the administrative burden on businesses. The Bill also now includes a provision for the flexible working provisions to be reviewed after two years, including a consideration of extending the entitlement to request flexible working to all employees. I note that the pre-legislative scrutiny reports on both the right to request remote working Bill and the work life balance Bill recognised the similarity of the Bills and recommended that certain aspects should align with each another. The proposed remote working amendments wholly or partially incorporate all 20 of the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the right to request remote working Bill. In particular, recommendation 12 of the report sets out that the remote working legislation should align with the general scheme of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. This is exactly what the Government is doing through the proposed remote working amendments. In addition, six of the 20 recommendations of the remote working pre-legislative scrutiny report centred wholly or partially on the role a statutory code of practice might play in the implementation of the legislation once enacted. Through the proposed amendments, a single code of practice will be developed, which will form a core element of the decision-making processes governing requests for both flexible and remote working. I have no doubt we will discuss these in more detail on Report Stage. I commend the motion to the House.

Let us be honest: this debate would not have come about if Sinn Féin had not sought it. It is a pretty sad state of affairs that we had to request a debate on this matter, and on the broader issue of what is being done with this Bill. An amendment is being inserted into the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which in effect inserts a whole new piece of legislation into this Bill on its final Stage. It inserts what should be a stand-alone piece of legislation on remote working. This decision means bypassing key legislative stages in the Oireachtas. Legislating to deliver a legal basis for remote working has been a priority for workers and representatives for a long time. Despite having nearly two and a half years to deliver this important legislation through a stand-alone Bill, the Government and the Tánaiste have failed. As a result, we now have a situation where the Government is trying to circumvent its failure by allowing the Tánaiste to annex his remote working legislation onto the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. The result is that complex legislation, which should be delivered by way of a stand-alone Bill, is being introduced by way of amendment. By introducing the legislation as an amendment on the final Stage, the Government is bypassing three key stages that a stand-alone Bill would have gone through in the Dáil, namely, Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage. The Government and the Tánaiste are pulling a fast one in relation to remote working and are denying us, as elected representatives, the opportunity to query or raise concerns regarding these complex legislative changes around remote working. This accusation will be reinforced later this evening when Report Stage of the work life balance Bill will be guillotined. There are a number of questions regarding the recently published amendments that need to be answered. The new section 18(2) states that an "employee’s approved remote working arrangement shall not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed 6 months continuous employment with the employer concerned." Why is the six months of continuous employment still being persisted with? Looking across the water, just this week the British minister with responsibility for small businesses has removed the clause requiring six months' continuous employment for workers requesting remote working. In announcing he was doing this, Kevin Hollinrake said it was a "no-brainer" to extend the existing right to request flexible working after 26 weeks with an employer to all employees from day one, as it would help to balance work life, help in terms of home life, help those with caring responsibilities and create a more diverse workforce. All we are asking is that the Government try hard to be as good on workers' rights as the Tories. The proposed section 18(3)(c)(i) provides that a worker must state the reason they are seeking remote working arrangements. This is referred to as "the employee’s needs". Why should workers have to talk about their personal circumstances? Why should their personal circumstances form part of the consideration for a remote working request? In my mind there is a paternalistic aspect to this, which will mean requests for remote working will not be equally considered. Furthermore, section 18(3)(c)(ii) refers to the need for a worker to provide details of the proposed remote working location. So long as the worker is based in the State, what business is it of the employer where they will be located for the purposes of their work? The worker needs to be sure they can conduct their work and respect the confidentiality of the work. We are talking about adults here. They are not kids. They can come to that arrangement without people having to give that sort of information. If the work duties are being completed and if, on the days that the employee is requested to be on site, they are on site on time and are performing their duties, why is it any concern of the employer what their personal living arrangements are? In the new section 23(2), what constitutes reasonable grounds for believing an employee is abusing remote working? How will this be proven? For instance, if Kevin is working remotely, and he is on top of all of his work, but he is seen in SuperValu at 3 o'clock in the afternoon buying milk, baby formula and a newspaper, can this be used as reasonable grounds to accuse him of abusing remote working? Kevin is working well, he is hitting all his key performance indicators and his work is fine, but he takes 20 minutes to get baby food and a newspaper. Could he be accused of abusing remote working? What are the checks and balances here? The Minister said that ramming all this legislation through together will simplify the process for employers and employees and reduce the administrative burden on businesses. It will not. There is absolutely no justification for that whatsoever. On and on the questions go, but we are denied a Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage debate on this. The result is that democratic oversight is curtailed and the ability to amend and improve these aspects is interfered with. My amendments to extend the paid leave for victims and survivors of domestic abuse were ruled out of order. As the Minister knows, we have a long-standing position in our party, similar to the position he used to have in his own, that ten days, which is the international norm, should be the benchmark. Ten days is what is available to people working in higher education institutions and in banks. For some reason, the Government saw fit to cut this in half. The Minister has not yet answered my questions as to how that is going to be dealt with within the Civil Service and public service, where there will effectively be two tiers. Some people will have ten days and some will have the statutory minimum of five.

It is possible that it will be addressed in the amendments on Report Stage this evening but in case it is not, I wanted to put this on the record. If it is not going to be addressed this evening, it may be possible to have it addressed in the Seanad. The carers say they welcome the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which includes a number of important provisions for family carers. However, they are concerned with a particular aspect of Bill, which they have raised previously and had hoped would be rectified at this point.That is why representatives from Family Carers Ireland are hopeful it might be addressed in the amendments this evening. Their concern relates to the specifications set out in the Bill regarding people for whom unpaid carer's leave days or flexible working can be applied for. They go on to list the various categories of person: the employees; the parent or adopted parent; the spouse or civil partner of the employee; a person to whom the employee is in loco parentis; the cohabitant of the employee; a parent or grandparent of the employee; a brother or sister of the employee; and a person other than one specified in any of the paragraphs (a) to (f), who live in the same household as the employee. Basically their concern is that the definition excludes applications in respect of care provided to non-relatives or other relatives who do not live in the same household. They feel it is at odds with carer's allowance and carer's benefit legislation and the Carer's Leave Act 2001, which allows a person to take carer's leave and receive a care-related payment for a neighbour, friend or relative including aunts, uncles and cousins. They argue that it is unusual that the legislation omits this and are wondering if it is some sort of oversight or a technical issue. They feel that they have been excluded. I am conscious of the time but I want to raise that matter with the Minister and hope he can look at it. As I said, he has tabled a number of amendments. Many of them are technical and might cover this. This came up on Committee Stage but if it is not covered, is there any way of looking at it before the Bill passes?

An increasing trend of the Government is to bring forward new and substantial amendments to Bills going through the Houses unrelated to the original purpose of the proposed legislation. It is not good practice and it hinders our ability to scrutinise legislation. It was used extensively on the Electoral Reform Act earlier this year. This week we have also seen a similar approach to the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is ramming through a planning Bill this week and next. In effect, the Government and the permanent Civil Service are regularly using Standing Order 187 to undermine the legislative process and turn the House into a rubber stamp. According to the motion, the Minister will make a series of legislative changes related to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, and Tusla. A further series of substantial amendments to the right to request remote work are not mentioned in the motion so while the Bill is recommitted for what we might term "a mini-Second Stage debate on specified grounds", it does not include the right to request remote work. By tabling these unscrutinised amendments on Report Stage, the Government has bypassed Second and Committee Stages, therefore, depriving Deputies of the opportunity to address in detail the impact of these proposals. It robs us of time to table substantial amendments to new proposals in this House, which are changed from the original draft law published in January. The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has published its scrutiny of the original Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2021 in July. It is only now in December that a new Bill is in effect being parachuted into this one and it differs from the original proposals in many ways. Since the start of the year we have called for a right to flexible work for all workers. The Labour Party published its own legislation and tabled a motion in the House in our Private Members' time in March where we called for flexible work to be the default option rather than giving employers the right to refuse requests. Results of an Ireland Thinks poll commissioned by the Labour Party showed an overwhelming demand from workers for this right. Some 71% of people believe in the right to flexible work; instead we are getting a right to request it. To take one example, according to the Minister's amendment, someone still must be an employee for six months before they can request a remote working arrangement. It is a key recommendation of the committee that this be removed and that there should be an automatic right to request. Our motion which passed this House in spring called on the Government to ensure its legislative proposals provided that any reason for refusal of flexible work relied upon by an employer must be objectively justifiable, appropriate and proportion. The original Bill included 13 grounds for refusal but instead the Government is now replacing that with an elevating code of practice to be agreed later. Our understanding now is that the employer grounds for refusing flexible work will not be rooted in the primary legislation. We know the gains made by workers during the pandemic on flexible work are being eroded and employers are more frequently demanding that employees return to the office. Measure of this nature require substantially more debate and scrutiny. Watered-down rights for workers should not be slipped in through late Stage amendments. Only 60 minutes have been provided later on Report Stage for more than 20 pages of amendments and the Minister and the Government should not rush this through in such a manner. On Committee Stage, the Minister also said he hoped to introduce provisions to provide for maternity leave for Oireachtas Members. Will he indicate what his plans are for that now?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	210	This is typical of what we see in December and it is hugely disappointing. There are many issues to be had with the Government's Report Stage amendments to the Bill and to have the debate this evening guillotined to 60 minutes is a joke. We requested extra time for the debate at the Business Committee, as did other parties, and that was refused. A few of the amendments were completely outside the scope of the Bill and we are having a debate on that for an hour while the actual debate time largely remains the same. Clearly there was room for a longer debate on the Bill but the Government was not interested in allowing it. The Government was pushed into having a debate because there was not a consensus essentially allowing the motion to go ahead without debate. The Bill contains a variety of issues which deserve a lot more scrutiny than they are being given. One of those issues is domestic violence leave, which the Government has capped at five days. It was made clear by witnesses and experts at the children's committee that five days is not sufficient and it must be ten days. My colleague, Deputy Cairns, tabled an amendment on this, which was ruled out of order. The West Cork Women Against Violence Project and Women's Aid outlined the importance of having ten days as a minimum, especially for women in rural settings who face additional barriers accessing services. The committee was told that a minimum of ten days was the international norm and that it was needed. Domestic and gender-based violence is endemic and the scale is terrifying. We could see that during Covid-19 particularly. We also know that the minimum leave possible should be ten days. It is inexcusable that the Government is suggesting five days. While rhetoric is strong in addressing issues around gender-based violence, actions are essential but this goes against international standards.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Government is attempting to slot the Tánaiste's Right to Request Remote Work Bill into Report Stage of this Bill. The Tánaiste's proposals on the right to request remote working are, to put it mildly, pretty useless. It is less a request for remote working and more a right to be told "No" in writing. No one was happy with the Bill. The unions and the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, did not support it and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment flagged a long list of issues with it during pre-legislative scrutiny. Instead of listening to that, withdrawing the Bill and going back to the drawing board, the Government has decided to completely disregard the legislative process and progress the contents of Right to Request Remote Work Bill directly through this Bill on Report Stage. It is completely inappropriate and indicative of the Government's absolute disregard for the legislative process. Second and Committee Stages would have saved the Tánaiste's proposals on remote work. They need to be scrapped completely. A right to request working from home does not go far enough. The default position should be that flexible working is permissible. It should not be at the whim of employers to accept or reject it. A change like this could be truly transformative, particularly for women, disabled people and carers, many of whom have been forced to give up work or locked out of the jobs market because of the absence of a statutory right to work remotely. A legal right to work remotely would also have helped the Government meet its climate targets. I would have thought this would have been one of the central points the Minister would have made. The climate action plan envisages car travel being reduced by 500,000 journeys per day by 2030. A legal right to work from home would help meet these targets, reducing the need to commute by private car. The right to remote working is also of crucial importance to ease housing pressure in urban areas and facilitate urban regeneration. Instead, the height of the Tánaiste's ambition seems to be a version of the underwhelming legislation from the UK on the right to request working from home, which was widely acknowledged to be of very little use, particularly to workers.We need a good deal more ambition than that. The pandemic already taught us that many jobs can be done remotely without the loss of productivity. The Government should not pretend otherwise. It needs to do more than make minor incremental changes in this area. There can be no going back to the old working practices. To ensure overdue and long-lasting reform, plans must include a legal right to work remotely. In addition, last week it was announced that a limited trial for a four-day week was overwhelmingly successful for the 12 companies that took part. Of those companies, some plan to continue with that model into the future. The trial resulted in increased productivity for the companies and significantly improved benefits for staff, including reduced stress, improved family time and better sleep. If the Government wants to show any ambition in this area, now is the time to roll out a much broader pilot project to examine moving to a four-day week. It will not be possible for everyone but certainly a wider pilot is necessary. It is now nearly 100 years since we moved from a six-day working week. Technology and work practices have utterly changed in the intervening period, not least since Covid-19 sped up dramatically the roll-out of remote working. A four-day week is a win-win for workers and businesses. The Government should now build on the success of this initial trial and develop its own pilot of a four-day working week.

Although the Act 2022 is now commenced in full and services are being delivered under the legislation, Tusla has now identified one area where the Act could be enhanced to further support the delivery of information services. Under Parts 3 and 4 of the legislation, a qualified person, the child of a deceased relevant person, can obtain the birth and early life information of his or her deceased parent in circumstances where the parent’s name on the birth certificate, or the grandparents, are also deceased, or a qualifying relative, namely, the next of kin of a relevant person who died as a child while resident in the mother and baby county home institution, can obtain the birth and early life information of the deceased relative. This is an important motion. In order to establish that the parent named in the records is deceased it would be useful for Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to have the authority to avail of the tracing powers provided for in Part 5 of the Act. This inclusion is necessary in scenarios where a relevant person is deceased and his or her child is seeking his or her identity information as a qualifying person under Part 3, and for access by a qualifying person to a birth certificate, birth and other information relating to the relevant parent. This amendment will enable Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland to contact a trace in circumstances where an application has been made under Parts 3 or 4. This would be automatic on receipt of an application and would not require a qualifying person to request the trace. This motion for Dáil approval is necessary for this amendment to be done via the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 and is outside the scope of this Bill. This amendment is important and I will engage with Members to support it.

Section 7F of the Principal Act is amended, in subsection (4A)-(a) in paragraph (a), by the substitution of “4.4 per cent per annum” for “6 per cent per annum”,(b) by the deletion of paragraph (c).”.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. Last year, the Government provided for an increase in reasonable profit on insurance policies from 4.4% to 6% by 2024. We tabled an amendment last year to reverse that and to undo it. It is a time of rising costs for families generally right across society, as we have debated several times. We all know about the cost-of-living crisis, rising energy costs, rising insurance costs, rising food costs and all of the rising costs that people are facing. To add additional costs for patients, and this is an increase of approximately 30% in profits for private healthcare insurance companies, is the wrong course of action. Our amendment seeks to reverse that increase from 6% back to 4.4% per annum, which is what it should be. I would welcome the Minister of State's response.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	219	I thank the Deputy for his contribution and for his proposed amendment. I remember being here this time last year and having the exact same debate. I must, however, reject the amendment and I will outline the reasons for this rejection. Section 7F of the Health Insurance Acts provides that if a beneficiary of the risk equalisation scheme makes more than a reasonable profit, the excess will be returned to the risk equalisation fund. This legislation was introduced in order to fulfil the requirements of the European Union state aid rules under the services for general economic interest framework. In 2015, the rate for a reasonable profit at 4.4% was agreed with the European Commission under state aid rules. The Deputy should be aware that in 2021 a reasonable profit figure of 6% was recommended to the Minister for Health by the Health Insurance Authority, the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market. The recommendation was based on a new benchmarking exercise among European and Irish insurers. Significant work was carried out in this regard. Independent advice was obtained from external consultants, Oxera Consulting, which was commissioned with the aim of verifying whether a return on sale of 4.4% was still appropriate for the 2022 risk equalisation scheme. Oxera Consulting advice was based on comparators with other European insurance companies and reflected recent trends in profitability of insurance sectors across a range of countries. The Oxera Consulting report concluded that the rate for overcompensation at 4.4% did not allow for reasonable profit, and noted an appropriate return on sales in a range between 5.5% and 8.6%. The report concluded that the benchmark should be adjusted to account for the changes in the financial reporting requirements and to ensure that the return on sales benchmark does not facilitate excessively high premiums in the market leading to unnecessarily high levels of profitability. The Health Insurance Authority's recommended figure of 6% return on sales was on the lower end of the range proposed by Oxera Consulting, taking into consideration the sustainability of the market and the maintenance of fair and open competition. The Deputy should be assured that the updated reasonable profit rate of 6% has again undergone due consideration as part of Ireland's state aid application which received European Commission approval under state aid rules in March 2022. It is not appropriate to progress with the proposed amendment as it would undermine the approval received from the European Commission earlier this year, which included approval of the benchmark of reasonable profit and the basis of the overcompensation assessment. As provided for under the Health Insurance Acts, the Health Insurance Authority carries out the overcompensation assessment every year, reports to the Minister and publishes the report.

I thank the Acting Chair. The overarching intention of the Bill, as colleagues will be aware, is to embed a culture of open disclosure in our health and social services. However, it is fair to say that many aspects of the Bill have been informed by the very serious learnings from what happened with CervicalCheck. This includes the need to ensure accountability by service providers and clinicians in carrying out open disclosure to patients and their families. In that regard, the Bill and its intended outcomes can be viewed as an important part of the legacy of reform and transformation arising from the issues in 2018 and how those issues have been addressed. I flagged on Committee Stage that I would be introducing an amendment on Report Stage to ensure open disclosure applies to completed patient-requested reviews of cancer screening. The approach we are taking here is based on the report of the expert reference group, published in 2020, into interval cancers. The group was set up following on from the report by Dr. Scally. It was deemed appropriate to follow the group's recommendations in respect of individual patient-requested reviews as providing the basis for open disclosure provisions. Amendment No. 19 is lengthy, comprising 21 sections. This is necessary to ensure full provision for mandatory open disclosure for patient-requested reviews of cancer screening. The provisions are similar to those already in the Bill in respect of mandatory open disclosure of notifiable incidences. This amendment will ensure that open disclosure applies to completed patient-requested reviews of cancer screening. This is key. It is one of the substantial amendments I am bringing forward on this Stage. I am now proposing that a patient-requested review of his or her cancer screening will be provided for in a new Part 5 of the Bill. This will ensure that current provision for open disclosure of a notifiable incident will be replicated in the new Part of the Bill for open disclosure of a patient-requested review of cancer screening. All reviews will have to be disclosed, irrespective of whether there is a discordance. This is the nub of it. All reviews must be disclosed to the patient where the patient has requested the review. Where there is a cancer diagnosis, all patients will be told the patient-requested review is available to them if they so choose. Our understanding is that in the UK, for example, approximately half of patients choose it. All patients will be informed that this is available to them. If they choose it, all patients will have that disclosed. Amendment No. 19 provides for the insertion of a new Part 5 in the Bill to provide for the open disclosure of completed patient-requested reviews of HSE cancer screening services. Such a review will be defined in the body of the Bill and will involve statutory requirements similar to those prescribed for patient safety incidences. This includes an obligation to make an open disclosure of a review, procedures for making open disclosures of a completed review by the health service provider, and offences similar to those already prescribed in the Bill for patient safety incidences. Implementing mandatory open disclosure as provided for in the Bill is intended to afford patients and families the opportunity to understand what went wrong, and to receive an apology where appropriate. Along with colleagues across the House, I have just come from a very useful discussion with officials, including the chief clinical officer. Very reasonable issues have been raised. One of those issues is the question of what would happen in the future in the case of the women affected by what happened with Cervical Check. The answer is that every woman who has a diagnosis of cancer would be informed that a patient review process is available to her should she want it. Every woman would be told. There would be mandatory open disclosure of that review should the woman choose to initiate a review. The reviews have been carefully designed with clinical and international experts, along with patient advocates and representatives. They have designed a review that works for the women, so that every woman will have this option, which was not available previously, available to them. That is the first important point. A second question being asked relates to programmatic audits. The Madden report, published in 2018, stated that we must have these learning audits in order to be constantly improving the service for patients and constantly improving cancer detection rates. It stated that these learning audits, which need to go on all the time, should be anonymised. There are several reasons they should be anonymised. It is international best practice. It is the recommendation from the expert reference group. We are working closely with the WHO at the moment and expect it to publish a position on this shortly. We expect that it will be in line with anonymised programmatic audits. We have considered practice in this regard in the UK and other jurisdictions and we have concluded that anonymised audits are international best practice. Why is that? First, it means the health service providers have access to all the data. They are used right across the HSE at the moment. They are a really important learning tool in order to constantly improve care. The second reason is that if programmatic audits were done but were not anonymised, what would happen - this is what happened previously - is that a health service provider would be saying it is going to take all of a patient's information without his or her knowledge or consent, and do audits on the identifiable information of the patient without him or her having requested that. We know from the UK that only half of those who are offered it actually want it. Many of the patients did not ask for this, and in many cases did not want it. When discordant results are found, of course they would be disclosed to the patient, as they ought to be.

I will finish on this. In essence, we are saying that we will have best international practice - anonymised programmatic audits - so that our screening services can get better. Every patient who receives a cancer diagnosis must be offered a review that has been created to work for the patient. The Bill states that the results of that review must be disclosed to the patient. My view is that this works for patients and puts Ireland as one of the few countries in the world that are putting the patient and the patient voice first and centre in terms of these requested reviews.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	230	I thank the Minister for the briefing provided today by his officials. We had a number of conversations on this issue in recent days. I will start with an observation that I have stated privately to the Minister. It is also important that I put on the record that everybody wants to arrive at the same place. That position is genuinely held by everybody in this Chamber. We all know how emotive the CervicalCheck scandal was and we all want to make sure that duty of candour and open disclosure is what it is. We have arrived, however, at an unsatisfactory place, where we have an important amendment that inserts this Part 5 request into a Bill on Report Stage. There are genuine concerns, which I imagine many of us have, and we now have limited time, even with the additional time that has been allocated, to not just discuss those amendments but amend them, if we want to. It is more difficult on Report Stage to amend. In fact, it might be impossible if a Deputy has not previously raised an issue. We are quite limited in what we can do. On top of that, stitched into this Bill, as I said privately to the Minister, is an entirely new section relating to the role of the chief officer in inspections of nursing homes. Again, I support this section and much of it is good but we do not have sufficient time to properly interrogate it either. We have arrived at an unsatisfactory position regarding how the Bill is being dealt with. Others may make the same point. I have an issue with the process, in addition to what is being proposed. In some respects, there is an absence of a statutory duty of candour in the Bill. It also does not provide for an obligation on a provider or clinician to inform a patient of the right to a Part 5 review at the point of diagnosis. When I spoke to the Minister privately, he said that was not in the Bill but it would be in guidelines elsewhere. I would prefer if it was in the Bill. I would prefer that to be a legal requirement of clinicians so that it would be crystal clear that this is a requirement. When the Minister responds, he might explain to us exactly how it will work in practice. That is, again, a legitimate and reasonable request. The Bill does not specify or provide powers to the Minister of the day to prescribe how the review is done. In fact, the section leaves it to the lab itself, as far as I can see from my reading of it - if the Minister wishes, I will read him the section - and that is problematic. We will certainly table amendments to that section when it goes to the Seanad because we think this is unsatisfactory. The core issue, however, relates to whether the Part 5 review will do what it should do, and whether it will do what Vicky Phelan, all the women, myself, others and the Minister want. No matter what the circumstance, if a discordant slide is found, particularly those horrific ones that we know happened in the past that led to the CervicalCheck scandal, there is no requirement to request a review other than if a request comes from a woman. There is no legal requirement on the lab if it does a look-back, or conducts this programmatic review or audit, to inform a woman of a discordant slide. That is problematic. There is a difference between an obligation on a service provider or clinician to provide information as of right, if that is what a woman wants, as opposed to her having to ask and having to go through what is called a Part 5 process to get information that, I imagine, we all agree should be done as of right. Even if we have an anonymised-type programmatic review or audit, it should still be possible, if there is a troublesome, difficult, discordant slide, to be able to trace that back to a patient and that patient then being informed. The Minister said in response that means information could be used by the lab, possibly against the wishes of a patient. Maybe that is something that could be looked at. When a woman undertakes a smear test or a cervical check screening, she might then agree, as part of qualitative audit look-backs that if a discordant slide is found, she would indicate she wants to know about it. We should give women that choice. That is not the choice they are being given. That is the difference between how I see it and possibly how the Minister sees it. I understand, from an education perspective, that there is a need to collect data and to do look-backs for all sorts of reasons. My point is, in its simplest form, when we look at everything that happened in the past, no matter what the situation is in the course of a lab's business - it might be in the course of a look-back, audit or other reason - and whatever the circumstances, where a horrific, discordant reading is found, if a woman wants that information to be disclosed to her, it should be done as of right and automatically. It should not be up to the woman or patient to have to request a review. That aspect of the Bill is fundamentally flawed. Vicky Phelan's file, as the Minister knows, contained information relating to her discordant reading. She picked up the file, read it and found out to her horror, at that point, that there was a discordant reading. That was done as part of a non-anonymised look-back. Under what is being proposed, that would never even have ended up in her file and she would never have known. Even if there was a right to review, how would she have known to seek a review? She would never have guessed or known that there was a difficulty in the first place. That is the flaw in what is being proposed and the difference between how the Minister sees it, I see it and others in the HSE see it. Other Members want to come in. I will leave it at that. I have concerns about all these matters. If we are to have duty of candour and open disclosure, it has to be an obligation and not simply a right to request. A right to request is important. It is part of this and gives added value, but it cannot be a replacement for placing an obligation on a provider, if that is what a woman signs up to. If a discordant reading is found, in whatever way it is done in the course of a lab's work, a woman should be informed. This section simply does not do that.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	231	It is important to note that while there is a lot of focus on the issue of open disclosure, the original, horrific and fatal problems associated with CervicalCheck the last time were to do with poor standards in the labs. That was the fundamental problem. In the past week or two, we read some of the background to that decision taken in 2008 by the then Minister to outsource all of the lab analysis to the US, with no regard to the poor standards that applied. What Dr. Scally came up with in that regard was horrific and shocking. Lessons have to be learned from that both in terms of health services and across the board generally. The argument that the then Minister made for removing the labs from Ireland - several labs here had dealt with large numbers and there had not been an issue about it before then - taking the work away from Irish labs and outsourcing to those standard labs in the US, which had fatal consequences, was on the basis of saving money. People were told that the Minister was of the view that the cost of outsourcing would be approximately one third of what it cost to do the analysis in Ireland. It has turned out, in human terms originally and primarily, lives were lost unnecessarily. That was a massive price to pay. In addition, for all the other reasons in cost terms, it turned out to be a massive cost. As a result of that, we lost a lot of expertise, corporate memory, corporate expertise and so on, which will be hard to restore to labs in Ireland. Fundamentally, we have to get a guarantee regarding the standards in labs. While I note what Dr. Scally said about Quest Diagnostics currently, we need to accelerate the programme of developing capacity in the Coombe hospital. Major issues remain regarding the lack of staff, principally, and a lack of forward planning for those qualified staff.There is also a question about whether recent recruits to the lab have the requisite qualifications. The Minister must get to grips with these issues. He must be in a position soon to give guarantees about the standards that will apply to the analysis of smear tests and the repatriation of those tests to Ireland. The duty of candour is another key issue. Dr. Scally stated that the duty of candour should come as naturally as breathing, but that has not been the culture within Irish medicine. This issue must be addressed. Discussing legislating for future arrangements is all very well, but one of the key findings in a previous report by Dr. Scally - it may have been the first report - related to the failure of consultants to be candid with their patients and the need to introduce some measure to restore trust, given that trust had been lost. His recommendation was that there be restorative meetings, whereby all of the consultants involved made arrangements to meet their patients to try to restore trust, apologise and provide some kind of acceptable explanation for why the patients were kept in the dark. As far as I am aware, those meetings have not happened to any great extent. It is an outstanding recommendation that needs attention, having received none recently. Will the Minister devote some attention to it? It is only right that women be able to request a review, and I welcome his proposals in this regard. However, an issue arises concerning the list of notifiable incidents. I spoke to him about this earlier. Dr. Scally was clear on this point and stated:The limited scope of the Bill is problematic. The Bill only specifies the mandatory requirement for open disclosure in the case of 13 categories of incidents. 12 out of the 13 highly specific incidents where notification would be mandatory relate to the death of a patient. This, under any circumstances, represents a tiny proportion of harm caused to patients through clinical error.I tabled amendments to include significant harm in those 13 incidents. Unfortunately, they were ruled out of order. That was wrong. The Minister has stated that it is his intention to extend the definition in a Schedule. Will he put on record that he intends to do so? In the past week or so, I have been in touch with the 221+ group regarding his amendments. This matter is one of the group's principal concerns. In fact, it was the only concern the group relayed to me. Will he commit to broadening the scope of the notifiable incidents and set out a timeline for doing so? He has stated that broadening the scope is his intention, which is fine, but who knows who will be the Minister next year or in five year? I ask that the Minister be clear in what he is putting on the record.

It is good that we are debating this Bill and that we have reached this point. It would be a shame if we did not get it right at the last minute. The question we must ask ourselves is whether the Minister's amendments will live up to what Vicky Phelan and other campaigners would have wanted to be part of the legislation. If the answer is "No", then the Minister needs to recognise that and go back to the drawing board. All Deputies want to work with him on the Bill and to achieve the same outcome, namely, a service in which women have confidence. I use the CervicalCheck service and want to have confidence in it. I want my daughter and my friends to have confidence in it. I want them to know that, as a right, there is not information about them, their health and their well-being about which they are not aware. Unfortunately, the way the amendment is constructed - and what the Minister has stated - means that every woman will be told she has a right to a patient safety review but she will not be told if there is a discordant slide.

The Minister might clarify, but my understanding is that, if the anonymous programmatic audit he mentioned had been in place in 2014, Lorraine Walsh, Vicky Phelan and all the others would not have been informed of the discordant slides. We need to remember that this situation came about through someone looking at her file. She opened the file, saw something in it and pursued it. That is not the right way to find out such information. The burden should not be placed on the person who has cancer to ask these questions. It would not be fair. The test of this has to be that, if we took ourselves back to that time, there would have been nothing in the file for Vicky Phelan to ask about. I would welcome clarity from the Minister on this point. As my colleague, an Teachta Cullinane, stated, we are all here for the same reason and we all want the same outcome. We want to ensure that the service is fit for purpose and women have confidence in it. We all acknowledge that, notwithstanding the good work done by the people who provide its services, which are efficient and well run for the most part, confidence in CervicalCheck has been shaken. Work must be done to rebuild that confidence. From speaking to Dr. Scally, he acknowledges this as well. Some of it is down to misinformation and some is down to people misunderstanding. That will always happen when non-medical people interact with medical people. However, some of it has to do with the fact that women wanted to understand a little more about how the system worked. From reading newspapers recently, they would have seen the correspondence that Ms Mary Harney received as Minister pointing out the issues with outsourcing services. This would not instil people with much confidence. I never liked the idea of my slide venturing off to the US or God knows where else to whatever lab - it turns out that no one knew - without the proper checks and balances being in place. I accept that they may be in place now, but it never sat well with me that this was happening. I do not believe it sits well with other people either. When we hear that Ms Harney had been written to and informed in stark terms about issues with outsourcing, it knocks people's confidence. We are all here for the same reason. We want to be able to walk out of the Chamber tonight knowing that we have done our best and that, as much as we can as non-clinicians, we have given women confidence in their service, including the confidence to know that, if there is a discordant slide, that information will be conveyed to them as a right and they will not have to ask for it. If we provide the right to ask, perhaps people will not exercise it because they are busy or so on. We should not put the burden of asking on the person who might have cancer. The information should be available as a right.The test of this has to be that if we were to go back to 2014 we would need to know that things would have been different. The way things worked out then was not good. The outcome was catastrophic for many women and their families. We, therefore, must be able to say with confidence that if we hopped in a time machine and went back to 2014, and the amendments, as the Minister has outlined them, had been passed and in place then, what impact they would have had then. If we were to fast forward back to our own time, would we find ourselves talking about this CervicalCheck scandal?  Nobody likes to hear a service they rely on, a really good service, mentioned with the word "scandal" attached to the end of it. CervicalCheck is a good thing. It is something I have always encouraged people to have done. Talk to any of my friends and they would say I told them to get it done. It is not nice, it is not a bit nice, but it is worth having done. It is surveillance. Not everything will be caught, and I understand all that. When I was my party's health spokesperson, I did not appreciate being spoken to by some of the people in the HSE as if I did not understand what surveillance is. I understand it very well. Believe me, when this procedure is being done, you do find out what it is, where it goes and how it is going to impact. We are all here for the same reason and we want to achieve the same goal; we just need to ensure we get it right.

We all want to deliver for the many women who have been failed by what happened in respect of CervicalCheck. The recent death of Vicky Phelan has put this matter at the top of the agenda, as is absolutely necessary. The fact, however, is that we have often had issues in this State where the Government and agencies, especially when we talk about the history of the HSE and other organisations, have travelledl part of the distance but not the entire distance. I sometimes feel we do a grave disservice to those people, and those women in particular, in many cases, who have been wronged. We do not deliver what is necessary. Deputy O'Reilly put it well regarding the crucial necessity of screening and of CervicalCheck. We want people to have the confidence in the process that has definitely been knocked to a great degree. Part of this endeavour, therefore, is seeing right done for those who were failed. It goes beyond that, though. It is also about ensuring that people have confidence in the system. Deputy Shortall put it very well too. We started out dealing with the initial period of the CervicalCheck scandal. What happened is that we had outsourced laboratory services to America. As people will understand, many politicians in here, including former Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, and others, railed against this being done for years. They did that because they could see this was being done not from the perspective of the public and to ensure we were looking after people's safety, but based on saving money. This approach has been disastrous, in the sense that it has brought us to this point. We are talking about a duty of candour, open disclosure and the necessity of these aspects. We all understand how screening works, that it can be an imperfect science and that mistakes can be made. This point has been put far more eloquently by other speakers before me. The fact remains, however, that we cannot put the onus in this regard on patients who are dealing with cancer and trying to cope with their medical issues. These people are under severe pressure. We cannot put additional pressure on people to request a part 5 review. We must ensure this is down to clinicians and the system. Especially in cases where discordant readings are being dealt with or mistakes that can have a critical impact on people's lives, we must ensure the people concerned are told about this. I assume the Minister will come back to us - on some level,I think he has already indicated this - regarding how he sees it being possible to find another means by which people will be informed of this type of situation, whether we are talking about guidelines or whatever. It would need to be pointed out to me why we do not just bed down this aspect in the legislation now. As I said, we must ensure we have the entire toolset put in place from the perspective of ensuring we do not allow circumstances to develop again that repeat what happened when Vicky Phelan and others were not given the information they should have. Questions have been also thrown up concerning the anonymised audit system. It has been pointed out that Vicky Phelan, on the basis of this system, even if she got a look at her file, would not have been able to see the pointers to her own situation. Deputy Cullinane and others spoke about the fact that, if we take the Vicky Phelan case, the system we are putting in place has not actually caught those mistakes in the process. The aspect I cannot get out of my head is that, as I said, we have travelled a significant part of the journey but we have not managed to put in place a process and a system that will protect women from what happened before. It will not ensure that if there is information concerning discordant readings, necessary medical information that these women need to know about, that there will be an onus on the clinicians and the system to ensure this information is given to women to enable them to make the best choices possible. The unfortunate thing is that at times Irish people are very civil, busy and all the rest of it, and we will not necessarily seek reviews etc. Once again, we must ensure we have a system that is sufficiently robust and that does all that is necessary. I am repeating myself, but I do not get how we got to this point. Working on the basis that we all wanted to deal with the issues that Vicky Phelan and others have put on our agenda and ensure there is a duty of candour, open disclosure and a system to guarantee that everybody, particularly all these women in similar circumstances, would be provided with their necessary medical information, we are now going to put in place a process that will not exactly do this.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to some of the questions put to him, but I cannot get my head around how we would not just deal with all these issues and ensure the responses are embedded in the legislation. We could then do right by those women who have been failed and put in place a system that is fit for purpose. Beyond that, we must get timelines concerning the Coombe hospital and when these lab services will be up and running. Furthermore, we must find out what percentage of lab services will be undertaken there and how many other lab services will be still outsourced?

Cuirim fáilte roimh an gcinneadh tuilleadh ama a chur ar fáil faoi láthair ach nílimid san áit inar chóir dúinn a bheith. Níl an rud a bhí Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhathúna agus go leor daoine eile ag lorg anseo sa reachtaíocht. The point has already been clearly made that there is a key lesson here for other public services. It is not the case that nobody warned of the danger of outsourcing and sending these slides to laboratories in the United States where, after some time, it became evident that the standards of the checks were not what they should have been. The implications were enormous. It was clearly raised in correspondence with the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, and she was aware of it. It was raised by former Sinn Féin Deputy, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, and other Opposition Deputies at the time. There is a lesson in that for us but in this particular instance it had very weighty consequences. It led to women not being informed of a very serious health concern and threat to their lives and, unfortunately, several of them died subsequently. What the Minister has put before us is not so much the issue. We do not have an issue with the Bill or the amendments. It is not that this is not better than the status quo ante. It is an improvement on it but it is not a duty of candour or open disclosure. The definition of "candour" is "the quality of being open and honest; frankness". There is an active obligation on the person who has the information. This legislation is not pushing for any active obligation on the part of the medical practitioner here. The Minister states that he might deal with this obligation in regulations but we are not nailing it down in terms of an obligation to inform people of their right to review. I note the Minister is shaking his head but we are not telling people that they have a right to a review. The Minister can address the issue in a minute, if he wishes, but that is certainly my understanding of the legislation. It is welcome that there is a right to a review, which is better than what was there previously, but it is not the case that there is an obligation to inform people of that review or to inform them that there is a legislative obligation to tell people of a discordant slide. I emphasise that I am a big believer in screening. It has been a crucial public health intervention, not only in relation to this cancer but in relation to other cancers as well and in other areas of health. It has a crucial role to play. It is vitally important that we ensure there is full confidence in screening but to do that, we need to heal the scars of the past, rectify the failings that occurred and become leaders in this regard. The Minister will be aware of the scale of screening. How many women go through the screening programme each year? We will take this year as an example. Does the Minister know that figure off the top of his head? In any event, I would expect it to be several thousand. When dealing with that scale, it will include women who potentially have limited English, vulnerable women and women with limited health literacy who are undergoing a crisis of whatever sort and simply want to get out there. Many women will ask for a review. Many will see this debate and become aware that they have that right. That is welcome and it is better than what is there now. However, there are other women who will not have that knowledge, wherewithal or, potentially, the English or communication skills to ask for a review, and it will not occur to them to do so. We have to take into account every category of woman who will potentially go into this programme. The scale is significant. We need to take into account every set of circumstances. That is why it is important that there be a duty on the medical practitioner to inform women of their rights and what they are entitled to know. Much of this is technical and we could discuss it in detail but, on a fundamental level, it is quite simple. This is the bit I do not understand and for which I have not been given an explanation. I have not seen the Minister, truthfully or in any meaningful way, dispute the fact that there is not an obligation on the medical practitioner. I also have not heard an explanation as to why we are not doing this. Is there a good legislative or constitutional healthcare policy reason we are not doing this because it seems relatively fundamental? Whatever about future guidelines the Minister may issue, we are not making it necessary in law for the medical practitioner to tell women they have a right to a review and that there is a discordant slide. That does not seem to be the case and I do not understand why it is not being done. I would appreciate it if the Minister outlined why that is not happening. There is a shared desire to rectify this issue, put Ireland in a much better place and make this State a leader in screening. That is laudable. I welcome the additional time for this discussion and the engagement in advance of these amendments. It is clear, however, that this is not what the women, including the late Vicky Phelan and many others, sought. That needs to be addressed and I urge the Minister to do so. I do not understand why we are not simply doing that.

In fairness, this has gone on for a long time and I acknowledge that the Taoiseach made a commitment when Vicky Phelan passed away that it would be done. I also acknowledge the Minister's officials and the people who work with him. They met us earlier and went through my concerns and those of others and, in fairness, addressed some of them. We should not be here, however. This is so rushed. We got more than 40 pages of amendments on Friday. The more I go into this, the more questions I have. I want to support this Bill. We should not be here doing this like this. Even next week would have been fine because we could have done with more time with the Minister's officials. I have had more questions since I came out of today's meeting. I have spoken to many more people. We should not be here. It is not good practice, particularly on such a sensitive Bill. I am passionate about this Bill for reasons the Minister is well aware of. This is simply not open disclosure. I will not have enough time to go through all my issues but having reflected on the meeting we had, I understand the balancing act the Minister's officials have. There is a balancing act here. This is highly technical legislation that crosses into many different areas. I understand that. I have sympathy for the Minister and his officials in trying to perform this balancing act, particularly when it comes to screening given everything that has happened and in relation to ensuring we have providers into the future. Dr. Scally, in moments when one talks to him privately, will acknowledge that there was a balancing act and a need to keep the system in place. I often speak to Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap, as the Minister knows. They are very good friends of mine and I have worked with them for many years. They are watching me speak. They do not support this legislation in this format. That is the test for me because, to quote Stephen, it is "not fit for purpose." I will not quote Lorraine because of the way in which she put it.Others have spoken before me. This does not pass the Vicky test. That is so important to me. It does not pass the test because if Vicky's case was going through this process, there would not be an obligation. This is why we cannot support the Bill as it is drafted. I know the Minister has said that is not the view being taken. I have a number of other points to make on the way in which the anonymisation will be done. In fairness, the officials have made good inroads in explaining this to me. It is causing real issues. In this scenario women will have to request their files and they will have to know how to do it. I did not come out of the meeting convinced. I knew information would be provided on this, that and the other but I did not come out of the meeting fully convinced that the people who would need to tell the women would legally and morally do so. It is just not there. It is not strong enough for me. I was told in the meeting that members of the 221+ group were fully consulted on this legislation. I want to ask a direct question. Were they shown the Bill? The Minister might answer that. I know what they were consulted on. Was the 221+ group shown the Bill? Did officials or anybody go through it with the group? That is a very direct question and I would like an answer to it. I think I know the answer but I would like to get it on the record from the Minister to give him an opportunity, to be fair. I have an issue with how the audits will work and the process by which the laboratories will behave and the contractual nature of how this will operate. I am not in any way satisfied with the legislation in relation to this. I have a significant issue with regard to a point that is often missed. People forget that we are not doing auditing at present. I know audits are good things. They are good for various reasons such as to learn. We can learn things that go across other programmes, not even in the programme itself. There is a range of reasons it is very good practice. The audits stopped at Vicky's case and they have not begun. I have significant concerns that there will probably be legal issues with regard to the Bill being introduced now and being retrospective from 2017 to now. All of the variables with regard to what happened to Vicky, Ruth Morrissey and everybody else have not changed an iota. That means statistically there have to be other issues. This Bill is going backwards and there will probably be legal issues with it. I want the Minister to reflect on what has been said tonight. I do not believe the Bill will be finished tonight. The officials and the Department need to reflect, come back and work with us on proper amendments. They need to speak to Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap and others in the 221+ group. They need to go through the legislation completely, explain it and address their concerns. I have a point to make on notifiable incidents. I took from what the Minister said earlier that 12 of the 13 reasons are where somebody passes away. I understand the Minister can extend this by secondary legislation. The Minister needs to say on the record that it is his intention to do this while the Government is in place. This is a significant weakness.

I would like the people of Ireland to know what happens following a serious incident or death in a HSE hospital. If someone is unfortunate enough to be injured or if a loved one is injured or, worse, dies under the care of a HSE hospital, this is what happens afterwards. I ask the Minister to give me his attention. A member of staff who has witnessed the incident is supposed to electronically record it locally in the hospital through a system called Q-Pulse. A line manager is then supposed to investigate the incident and speak to witnesses. Details of a serious incident are to be reported to the national incident management system in the State Claims Agency. I have discovered that staff in the HSE often record incidents locally on Q-Pulse but serious incidents are not always reported nationally. Therefore, no national record is kept of incidents related to a certain Department or member of HSE staff in a particular hospital. This leads to the safety of the public being seriously compromised as opportunities are missed to prevent future incidents. I found an article on the Internet written by a former consultant in University Hospital Limerick, UHL. He refers to 140 incidents he recorded on Q-Pulse in UHL that were never followed up by management. We now have 70 medical professionals who have also stated they have reported incidents in hospitals and nothing was done. This is what the public needs to know. The HSE jointly manages the national incident management system members in conjunction with the State Claims Agency. The HSE is the owner of the national incident management system healthcare data and related patient safety services user incidents. The State Claims Agency has no regulatory function and does not have legal powers to impose sanctions. It might be decided by the HSE that an independent investigation should be carried out in a serious incident but the investigation team will be made up of past and present HSE employees and will sometimes include a member of staff from the same hospital. The HSE investigation report is then given to the coroner to refer to if there is an inquest into a death. Those who are not happy with how an incident has been investigated can seek help from HIQA but, again, it is made up mostly of past and present HSE employees. A doctor involved in a serious incident may be reported to the Irish Medical Council. Its members are mostly past and present HSE employees.

The Medical Council then seeks a so-called external expert investigation. This expert is usually a past or present HSE employee. If a serious concern is brought to the national patient safety office in the Department of Health, a past or present member of the HSE is working there and the Minister for Health is the head of the service. The same Minister appoints certain members of the Medical Council. How can this system be fair and just? Where is the natural justice? The HSE investigates itself and has its own members on every health authority. It appears to have total control of incidents and how they are dealt with, including death. The public does not stand a chance. I am asking for a public inquiry into all serious incidents recorded locally in UHL. The HSE's incident recording system is not fit for purpose. It is dangerous and unreliable. After a public inquiry, I will call for an external body to investigate all serious incidents in the health system in Ireland that does not involve any past or present HSE member. I have asked the Minister for his help on more than one occasion and I am doing so again. We have serious incidents that are being reported but not investigated.Serious incidents have been reported and are being looked at by HSE employees even if there has been a death. After raising the issue of cover-ups in UHL, I was recently asked by reporters if I could send them information I had on this. Here is the piece for the media to understand. I submitted three incidents on UHL more than 12 months ago, and the HSE wrote to ask me if I could disclose the information. It already had it on file for 12 months. We are trying to ensure patient safety. If there are incidents, they should be reported properly and we will try to protect patients in the future. If the Minister is not willing to ask people from outside the HSE network to investigate cases, we will never rectify the problems we have in Ireland. It was done in the UK. Political people pushed for it. Independent investigations were conducted and hospitals were held to account for the mismanagement of incidents that were reported and never dealt with. I again ask the Minister to investigate UHL using independent people and to hold people to account for mismanagement, which has been raised with the Minister and the HSE by health professionals. We must help them to make sure we can stop the occurrence of future deaths or serious incidents in UHL.

The Bill also fails to specify or provide powers to the Minister to prescribe how the review will be conducted. It is similar to self-regulation. How can we do something in this Chamber and have it looking like self-regulation? It is just not right. The bottom line is that we are not giving people the right to information unless they seek it, and that is very unfair. We should have the right to automatically get this information. The Government is forgetting that patients are at the heart of this. We must protect the viability of the screening services; we understand that. Approximately 250,000 CervicalCheck screenings will be carried out this year and that has to be welcomed, but it must be a process that is safe and people must get their information. A specialist who provides counselling support for women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal has stated, "I see a state that pays lip service to acknowledge its mistakes and yet the systematic failures are blocking and resistant to change causing ongoing heartache, a trauma without a bottom line that keeps adding to the suffering of women I met." Deputy Shortall said earlier that there is a lack of forward planning and I totally agree with her. Women must have trust and they do not currently have that. It is up to us as legislators to make sure they get that trust. All Members of the House will continue to say they want to work with the Minister on this, but we have to work in a proper fashion. I also agree with what Deputy O'Reilly said about slides. We should not have them sent to another country. It is a confidence issue. We should be allowed to have slides examined in this country. I was a patient of the gynaecology department in the Coombe hospital and without it I would not be here. The trust of women in the hospital and gynaecologists they attend is vital. I firmly believe we must continue to do this in such a fashion. I also listen to people talk about the pressure people are under as patients and women. Not only that, but their families are under severe pressure as well. When a loved one is very sick, people are not sure how they will get the results, where the results will go to or what their rights are, so they too are under pressure. They are under pressure when their loved one needs them most. It is very difficult to give a loved one what they need when people are under such severe pressure. That needs to be addressed. How can we get this right when it so rushed? If the Minister does not get it right this time, he will not get it right at all. The Bill should not be rushed. The Minister needs to get it right and this issue must be addressed.

Those who listened to her or watched her could not help but be struck by her honesty, courage and dedication. She had the courage to fight - the bravest courage of all - for those who would, ultimately, come after her. I listened to other speakers who knew Vicky Phelan. Deputy Kelly said this Bill does not pass the Vicky test. The Minister has to make time to make the Bill Vicky-proof, and I hope he and his officials can achieve this. As he will know, managing disclosure was one of Vicky's core demands. Managing disclosure means there is a legal obligation on clinicians and healthcare providers to tell a woman if there is an issue with the reading of her cervical cancer screening slides. There was a consensus that the original Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill did not provide for this demand. As a united Opposition, we have said all along that we would work with the Government on this legislation to get it right and over the line. While that remains our position and commitment, the Government amendment does not provide for managing disclosure. There is provision for a right to review, which is welcome. An obligation on a clinician or health service provider to reveal and pass on information and manage disclosure where legal responsibility is on the clinician and organisation is what the women fought for. This was recommended in the Scally report. There is a concern beyond the definition of managing disclosure or the duty of candour about the review process. There is no legal obligation for the women, at the point of diagnosis, to be told she has a right to review. We have no issue with the Bill. It is better than what was previously proposed and better than the status quo. It is an improvement. We take issue with the process, however, and the absence of a statutory duty of candour in the Bill. It does not place an obligation on the provider or clinician to inform patients of their right, under Part 5 review, at the point of diagnosis. This obligation must be on the clinicians and not the patient. This is rushed legislation. In my time in the Dáíl, I have Bills being guillotined. Rushed legislation makes bad legislation. We do not want to come back in a year's time to make further amendments to the Bill that we could sort out here and now. Approximately 250,000 women will go for cervical screening tests each year. This is really welcome and we will encourage it. It is a vitally important tool. As a father of two young girls, this is something I want my girls to be able to access. I also want them to have the confidence that when they go to CervicalCheck screening, their human rights will be catered for and if there are any discrepancies in the results, the clinicians will have a duty of care to inform them straightaway. We have to protect patients' rights. This is the crux of the problem. We cannot expect everything of the person going for the test and nothing of the system. I cannot understand why a duty of candour is not enshrined in the Bill. I hope the Minister will clarify the reason for that because people need that question answered.Lay people looking at this debate want clarification on why something that could so simply be put into this Bill should not be put in to give people confidence in CervicalCheck going forward. If that were done, those who went before and their families would feel vindicated that they basically got the Bill they deserve.

We very much welcome this legislation and the opportunity to speak on it. We have no issue with what is in the Bill, as such, or with the amendments but we have a serious issue with the absence of the duty of candour in the Bill. We need open disclosure. We must have an obligation on the clinician to inform the patient when something arises and is found. The onus cannot be on the patient. We need a system whereby the patients are notified as a right. We are coming up to Christmas when many of us talk about empty chairs at the table. Politicians love to get all poetic when they are talking about Christmas. Most people in Ireland will never forget Vicky Phelan because she did without something to make sure women found out the truth. I am an egalitarian republican. I do not get excited about people, put them on pedestals or think they are great. However, when I met Vicky Phelan at a Strictly Come Dancing event in Dublin a couple of years ago, I went up to her because I admired her a great deal for being prepared to do without something in order to stick up for Irish women. We are not used to people sticking up for us as Irish women. This legislation is about Vicky Phelan. It is not long since we all stood up in the Dáil and remarked on how she did not wish anybody to give accolades to her. She wanted accountability. The truth is that Vicky was failed by the system. Elected women are not here just to bring a few colourful jackets into the Chamber. We are here to tell people how it feels. It felt really good to have Vicky Phelan. I remember when she spoke on the court steps about how she was prepared to stand up for women and the problems with CervicalCheck. Women rely on screening such as this. We know that when we go for our cervical check, which is horrible - I hate it - it is not 100% and is just a screening. However, the problem with this legislation and the anonymous programmatic audit is that Vicky Phelan would not necessarily have found out about her illness if it had been in place at the time. People are saying it feels like the tribunal all over again. It seems that even after what Vicky Phelan did, the culture - the patriarchal attitude - is still the same. Even since I became a Deputy, I have noticed all the hallmarks of patriarchal rule in this State. We have had debates on mother and baby homes and we spoke about maternity leave for councillors the other day. It is very important for people to listen when women stand up to talk. Vicky Phelan was not afraid to use her voice. She was marvellous. I do not like to make it personal about her but it is personal. There has to be collaboration. It seems that the Government will chase people to the death to keep them quiet about the open disclosure aspect of this matter. As many people say, it is not really about the money or about suing; it is about ensuring it does not happen again. Many people who were caught up in the cervical smear episode really showed that their priority was to make sure it did not happen to women again. I very much hope the Minister listens to this. The onus cannot be on the patient. At present, there is no obligation on the practitioner to disclose the information to the patient. We just cannot accept that. Women were forced into court even though the Minister for Health said clearly that this would not happen. He forced them into court and used the patients' money to keep them quiet. He knows it is a bottomless pit because we, the people who pay our taxes, are the cash cow that keeps the State defending the indefensible so many times. The absence of a statutory duty of candour just shows the dysfunction that is still there. I hope the Minister will rethink this. I have found him to be a Minister who listens. I hope he will see how passionately people feel about this. We appreciate him giving the extra time but the Bill as it stands is really not good enough.

Tá fadhb leis an próiseas áfach agus leis an easpa dualgais dháiríre atá ann. Níl aon dualgas ar dhochtúirí a rá láithreach go bhfuil ceart ag an othar i leith athbhreithniú Pháirt 5 maidir leis an diagnóis. Ba chóir go mbeadh córas tríd an chlárlann ailse a thugann eolas do dhaoine go bhfuil an ceart acu ag an bpointe seo. Ní thugann sé cumhachtaí don Aire. Léiríonn sé conas an t-athbhreithniú a dhéanamh. Tá sé cosúil le self-regulation. Ní chuireann sé an sampla ailse san áireamh leis an t-othar a chur ar an eolas agus ná bac le conas nó cathain atá an othar ag fáil amach. Ba chóir go mbeadh dualgas dáiríre chun an disclosure sin a dhéanamh mar tá an ceart ag daoine a fháil amach. Is ceart agus is cóir é sin. Dá mbeadh an reachtaíocht seo ann in 2014, bheadh a fhios ag na hothair, na mná sin, an toradh a bhí acu. We do not have any issue with what is in the Bill. We do not have any issue with the amendments either. Thanks be to God, there is information on other issues going through the system at present, for example through trolley count. I recently dealt with a case in Tralee involving a woman in her late 70s from the north of the county. Families are stressed because there is no isolation room in University Hospital Kerry. This woman was left on a trolley for days. We were able to do something about that because the information from trolley count was there. We have an issue with the process and with the absence of any statutory duty of candour in the Bill. There is no obligation on a provider or clinician to inform a patient about the right to the Part 5 review. There should be a system through the cancer registry that notifies patients of their right. Ba chóir go mbeadh an ceart ag gach éinne gach eolas a bheith acu ar an gcóras sin. We do not have the discovery of a discordant, erroneous or otherwise inaccurate reading of the cancer screening sample as a notifiable incident. When the system was changed and the outsourcing happened it was Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, almost alone, who pointed out that this would cause problems. He has not been given enough credit for his foresight on that occasion. If he had been listened to at the time, maybe many of the incidents would not have happened.There should be a duty of candour and to make a disclosure. It is important to make this point again and again because the patient has the right to know. If this legislation about the anonymous programmatic audit was in place eight years ago, all those women would have been informed of the reading and would have been able to see it in their files. They would never have discovered it until they asked for a review. In the words of another, this legislation would have made sure that nobody would have found out what was going on with CervicalCheck, since people were not given the right to information unless they sought it. Unfortunately, the Bill does not place an obligation on a clinician or service provider to inform a patient when the error or inaccuracy is discovered. No matter what type of information it is or how severe the misreading is, there is no obligation to tell anyone that something wrong was found. The Government is forgetting that patients are at the heart of this. We must protect the viability of the screening services. There will be about 250,000 screenings this year, which is welcome. We all want to see this grow but we must protect the rights of patients. We must have a national health service, like in England, which is free at the point of access. In the meantime, we must improve and expand medical card access to cover home care and palliative care. When it comes to who is responsible for a person getting the truth, the burden should not be placed on the person who has cancer to ask. We must acknowledge the mistakes by clinicians and doctors in the past and not stand behind an approach which puts a responsibility on the patient to take the steps while placing no obligation, except after a request, on any clinician to make a proactive, open disclosure, whether about cancer screening or something else. One specialist who provides counselling said they see a State that pays lip service to acknowledge its mistake and that systematic failures are blocking and resistant to change, causing ongoing heartache.

We have a Bill that should be unifying legislation. We support it in principle. Amendments have been tabled that, in and of themselves, are worthy of support. The difficulty is not so much what is in the Bill but what is glaringly missing, particularly the absence of a statutory duty of candour, from the Bill. Before this debate, I read some sections of Vicky Phelan's book, "Overcoming". I will read a short section of that which is from the period when this first came to the corridors of this House, when Vicky Phelan presented at the Committee of Public Accounts. It reads: A short time later we found ourselves sitting in front of a row of politicians at the Public Accounts Committee. Me, Stephen and my solicitor Cian. I was invited to speak first. I cleared my throat. 'If I do die, I want it not to be in vain. I want protocols to be put in place and sanctions for people who make mistakes and that the HSE is overhauled from the ground up, so that people are held accountable and that this will never happen again,' I said. I told them my story, from the beginning, and everything that had happened over the course of the past year. 'The misdiagnosis in my case has cost me my life. I've got terminal cancer,' I said. I took a deep breath. 'I don't believe I'm going to die but I have to fight for my life every day.' I outlined three issues that needed to be addressed: open disclosure (how could it be left up to individual doctors to decide whether or not to communicate information to their patients?), patient safety (we needed to rebuild trust in the system, to ensure this would never happen again) and responsibility of senior HSE management who approved the communication strategy regarding the audit results and whether patients were to be told about them (who was ultimately responsible for what had happened?). 'At least I'm still here to tell the tale and that's why I'm fighting with everything in my being ... I swear to God, over my dead body I'm going to keep at this. Simple as that.' Cian O'Carroll, my solicitor, spoke of the 'coordinated, premeditated plan to deny patients the information'. 'Not in total,' he added. 'The documentation suggests that it was envisaged that some patients would be told of the audit, albeit quite late in the day.'Those are the words of Vicky Phelan. They are the first challenge that she brought to this House, when she first presented at the Committee of Public Accounts. We have all spoken of our admiration. I do not believe that people of different political parties have any more or less admiration for what Vicky Phelan did in refusing to sign a non-disclosure agreement despite the strong pressure put on her to settle her case. The fact that she refused to do that is commendable. It is still a scandal that there has never been accountability for anybody who tried to force her to sign that non-disclosure agreement in the first place. She set out, time and time again, what needs to happen, which is clear. In the cases of those people who are the victims of mistakes or whatever else might have happened, the clinician or service provider must be obliged to inform the patient of where an error, mistake or inaccuracy is discovered. It is as simple as that. We have listened to those people who are directly affected by these scandals and hear from them that the amendments the Minister has tabled do not resolve their concerns. He is continuing to tell everybody else they are wrong in their interpretation. It points to a fundamental problem that we have with accountability, transparency and appropriate communications with the people who are at the coalface of mistakes made by the HSE and the health services. I appeal to the Minister to listen to what is being asked of him. Do not listen to us, since we are only politicians reciting what people have said to us. I ask the Minister to listen to them directly and to please make the necessary provisions so that we can have a Bill we can say, with hand on heart, will actually make a difference. It would have made a difference if it had been in place at the time when Vicky Phelan and others were so badly let down by the State. I make that appeal to the Minister once again because the rights of patients have to be paramount. Of course we understand that there has to be a layer of protection for the services, but there must be also a layer of protection for patients when they are failed. Otherwise, as history has shown us, when one allows a culture to exist which has no accountability for failures, they will continue to repeat themselves. Before I came into the Chamber this evening, I met some parents who were affected by the organ retention scandal. Daily and weekly, we meet with families and individuals who have been badly let down by our health services. In some cases, it involved simple mistakes, gross errors in others, and extreme gross negligence in others. In all cases, it is hard to pinpoint where anybody is held accountable or where the necessary changes have been made without resistance from the powers that be. I ask the Minister to change that and to write a new chapter tonight by working with the Opposition to ensure we have a Bill we can all be proud of, that this House can be proud of, so that we can collectively say to Vicky Phelan and all those other brave women who told their stories that we heard them, listened, and acted accordingly. Nothing less will be sufficient.

The duty of candour has to be put on a statutory footing. In the short few years I have been here, we have scandals including CervicalCheck, vaginal mesh, mother and baby homes, the mental health system and the disability system. It comes down to oversight, accountability and responsibility.We are all working on this Bill together. That is the agreed basis. The Minister has heard most of us talk about it. If we cannot keep the onus on the service provider or the clinicians we are going back to where we started before. We will have nothing. People will lose faith in the screening services and we do not want that. I will not mention any names but the patients are really at the heart of this. As I was listening to the debate I was saying to myself that we should not even be here. How hard is it to do the right thing? Let us break the status quo. Why is the Government so frightened? If we put the duty of candour on a statutory footing we will be nailing down accountability, responsibility and the oversight. It does not matter how big the mistake was or how far the actual incident had gone, it is about having the cojones to stand up and say we made a mistake and this person needs to be told the truth today. It is ludicrous that people are waiting on their screens to come back. I do not even think people are aware they actually have to ask for their results and whatever. If there is something wrong a person should be automatically told. I worked on the protected disclosures legislation and one of the big changes in the Act that will be coming into force in January is the reversal of the burden of proof. Where somebody in a whistle-blowing situation made a protected disclosure, the person it was made to had no obligation to prove the whistle-blower was actually telling the truth. I raise that because with the duty of candour we are not forcing but putting it into law and doing the right thing by stating that people have a responsibiltiy in their jobs, whatever it is, and they will be held accountable. It is very easy to see when somebody is taking on this job that it is not a quick flip for money. I still cannot understand why we even outsourced these services when we have plenty of people well capable of carrying this out. It has been said many times that there is nobody on this side of the House, or any side of it, who has issues with the Bill, except for this one little thing. Paper never refuses ink, so the Minister still has an opportunity to change things and change them for the right. We cannot bring back any family members or anybody who has unfortunately passed but we can certainly take a giant step forward in doing the right thing. We can say we as a collective body passed legislation that had the core principles of proper oversight, proper accountability and proper responsibility, but with the responsibility on the service providers as well as on the patients. I was reading though one of the notes, from which I will quote, "It was described by a survivor as like the tribunal all over again, nothing would be changed and we would have to look for it. That is not what we want, that we would actually have to look for our information". I appeal to the Minister. As I said, paper does not refuse ink. He can change things here. If we can nail down that duty of candour we will have done something right. My wife uses the services, as does my daughter. We want faith in them. You do not want something hanging over you just because of a technical glitch or because it was another word that was absent from this legislation. I appeal to the Minister. At the moment a service provider or clinician can sit back and say that if a patient does not ask them, they do not have to tell the patient. That is not proper legislation. There is a duty to say hold on, something is wrong here and to let that person or family know. It sounds like common sense but sometimes common sense - not even in inverted commas - comes into the House. It drives me bonkers and drives me mad. It is like self-regulation. If the Minister has the HSE investigating the HSE, we are not going to get accountability. We are not going to get proper oversight. I appeal to the Minister, if it is the only thing he can do, to ensure the duty of candour is on a statutory footing and that everybody involved moving forward will be held accountable if they do not do their job properly. Surely everybody should be responsible for what they do?

One of the central findings of the CervicalCheck scandal was showing up in lights the paternalistic nature of medicine and healthcare in Ireland. Ireland is not unique in that regard but we have a particular history, especially when it comes to women, poor people and people who are disadvantaged. In response to that, there are clear asks to address it. One of the things I took from the Scally report and this whole dreadful experience is there is a need for a culture shift. There is a need to address that information imbalance that exists between doctor and patient. It was at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal and how these women were failed. The absence of the statutory duty of candour is a glaring omission that does not address the key issue at the heart of the scandal. The question of whether we can go further and do better must be asked. We all appreciate these are complex issues, that there are considerations, that no two cases are the same but after everything that has gone on, after all the dreadful experience, this is a unique opportunity and we in these Houses are uniquely placed to respond, to address those failings and to introduce legislation and a process that is fit for purpose and at its heart constantly shows people their information is their information. It is about saying that exchange or transaction, for want of a better word, between a person and their clinician is an equal transaction. The person is not a part of a broader system. Their sample, their cells, their biopsy or tissue material is not in a system for the sake of developing and improving a system but is instead a central part of that transaction between patient and doctor.At the heart of this is the need to ensure confidence in CervicalCheck. Central to the lack of confidence, or the hollowing out of confidence, is the experience of the scandal. Related to that was the decision to outsource cervical screening. I worked in our hospital laboratory system in advance of that decision. Through my role as a union representative, I , along with other medical scientists, could see clearly what was going to happen with cervical screening if it was outsourced. We also saw the motivation. It was a cost-saving exercise. Of course, the HSE had alternatives. It could have resourced cervical screening in Ireland but it did not. It was part of a broader strategy. At the time, we invited those private laboratories that we outsourced cervical screening to into Ireland. It was not just cervical screening that our Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government wanted to give them. It wanted to give them hospital and GP diagnostics as well. They now have facilities out on the M50. They did not come here to do private testing; they came to do public testing, and a Fianna Fáil-PD Government wanted to give it to them. It outsourced cervical screening, with detrimental impacts. Thankfully, thanks to the efforts of union representatives and workers, it did not outsource the public and GP work. We need to re-establish confidence in the cervical screening programme by investing in and resourcing our laboratories. We need to repatriate cervical screening and bring it back. We need to do it in accredited labs. I recall the shock when people learned that many of the labs that cervical screening was outsourced to, and subsequently outsourced from the outsourced laboratories, were not accredited, but many of the laboratories in Ireland are accredited only on a voluntary basis. They are not supported or resourced adequately to be accredited. That needs to be addressed. We need to train up cytologists and we need to bring that work back to Ireland to give people confidence in it. We also need to establish this legislation and the process, to ensure that women can have confidence in the process so they know that when their cells and samples are in the system that they will have as much access to the information as their clinicians. To do that, we need a clear statutory duty of candour in the Bill.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	250	Deputy Alan Kelly set out our position on a number of elements of the Bill, including notifiable incidents, anonymisation, lack of consultation with the 221+ group on the Bill itself and auditing. I will speak to amendment No. 14, which is in my name and Deputy Kelly's. The Bill is trying to make open disclosure of certain incidents around patient care mandatory, but the quid pro quo for this open disclosure, such as it is, is that information or an apology given at an open disclosure meeting will be made inadmissible in any subsequent legal proceeding. That is a big element of the Bill. There may well be legal proceedings following on from open disclosures set out under the Bill and the use of open disclosure should not become a bar to legal action if harm has been done. As Deputy Kelly said, we cannot assume that everything is okay now. There will always be risks and people let down. That is why we need strong legislation and strong systems. We also need to ensure that open disclosure, such as it is outlined in the Bill, does not become a bar to legal action. Hence, our amendment is intended to make clear that the provision of information under the Bill to a patient who has suffered actionable harm would not become a bar to that information being admitted to a court in later legal proceedings if the information can otherwise be obtained in the ordinary way litigants use the rules of court in discovery of documents. I am interested in the Minister's response to our amendment. It is vitally important that this be accepted. This is one of many changes we think should be made to this Bill. I turn to the duty of candour. In Dr. Scally's final report, published last month, there is a quote that has been repeated in this Chamber and elsewhere. He states: "The right of patients to know the truth about their health should be at the heart of all the interactions between health services, health professionals, and patients ... for a health professional, telling the truth to patients should be as natural as breathing." Those are the words he used in his final report. He went on to say that it was difficult to see how this Bill, as written a month ago, which is more or less how it is written now, subject to the amendments the Minister has tabled, would change things. Even with those amendments, that would not change. The duty of candour is not going to be delivered in this Bill. That fundamental cultural shift that is required to make disclosure as natural as breathing, which requires a strong legislative underpinning, will not be delivered in the Bill, with or without the Minister's amendments. That is why the Bill, unfortunately, is not fit for the purpose for which it is intended.

Every Minister works hard but the Minister for Health goes above and beyond in his commitment. I support the Bill. There are good things in it and it is an important Bill. However, it will not build trust in the health system, where trust is in short supply. It will not build trust in the cancer screening process or the CervicalCheck system. It will not build trust in any of those. As has been said previously, we have no issues with what is in the Bill or the amendments but we have an issue with the process and the absence of a statutory duty of candour in the Bill. There has to be transparency. Patients have to be at the centre of this legislation, and the health system. Patients are vulnerable by their very nature and they need to be supported. Patient rights are a crucial human right. Patient rights are essential pillars in providing good healthcare and promoting good medical practices.A core element of patient care is to allowing patients to make decisions about their own care. To do that, they need all the information, whether it is good or bad, and they should not have to request that. There needs to be more clarity around the process. Patients are vulnerable; they are not well. They may have little family support. In my experience, particularly recently, I have found that medical practitioners can be quite dismissive of patients, particularly older patients. I have a letter from a woman who wrote to me who is in her mid-80s. In the late 1970s she went for a tubal ligation in a Munster hospital; one would imagine that this would have been a pretty standard operation. A number of years later, she found out that menopause was hastened due to the operation. She found out when she got the menopause that she had a" full ovary removal" in her words. She is still traumatised by it. At the time, she got on with it. She had young children and was under a lot of pressure. Even now, when she reflects on her life, she is traumatised by it. The fact that this happened without her knowledge was devastating and had a huge negative impact on her life. She wants to know what happened; she is still not sure. She is looking for that information. This is replicated throughout the health system, which is why confidence in it is low. This lady was let down by the health system. She should have been told automatically. She should not have possibly found out by mistake years later. It is unacceptable. The Bill is being fast-tracked. I accept there is a time and place to fast-track legislation but this is not one of those Bills. We need to ensure that patient safety and information are prioritised. This is an important Bill. It does not place an obligation on a provider or clinician to inform a patient of the right to a Part 5 review at the point of diagnosis. This can and needs to be done; it is essential. If we are going to rebuild confidence in the health system and the cervical cancer screening system, this information must be automatic and there must be a process by which people can get information. It does not matter how this or any woman discovers that there was a mistake or a procedure was carried out without their knowledge. Patients need to be told. It is completely unacceptable. In the words of a survivor, this legislation would have made sure that "nobody would have found out what was going on with CervicalCheck". The bottom line is that this is not giving everyone the right to information, unless they seek it. It does not place an obligation on a clinician or a service provider to inform a patient when an error, mistake or inaccuracy is discovered. Whether that is minor, within the margin of error or a severely negligent misreading, there is no obligation on anybody to tell anyone that they found something wrong. This is self-regulation. It will not work in the health system, which has been proven in the past. Self-regulation generally does not work and it certainly does not work in the health system. The right to information needs to be introduced.

We have an opportunity to guarantee that we as legislators do all in our power to ensure that the cervical cancer scandal is never repeated; to introduce and provide true accountability and real transparency; and to give the 750,000 women who will have smear tests this year confidence that their needs, concerns and, in some cases, fears, have been addressed and that at no point in the future will there be another scandal. It is not only the women and families of today that need to have that confidence and trust but it is our daughters, nieces and the young girls whose mammies are sick or whose mammies have passed. Will this Bill give them that trust? Without the duty to report, I fear it will not. Nobody in this House wants any screening programme to be undermined. I reiterate we have no issue with this Bill or with the amendments. The issue is with the process and the absence of a statutory duty of candour in the Bill, which does not place any obligation on a clinician to inform a patient of their right to a Part 5 review at the point of diagnosis. Let us imagine for one second a woman being told she has a cancer diagnosis and then imagine expecting that person to be in a frame of mind to request a review without that option being clearly put in front of her. It does not include the discovery of a discordant, erroneous or otherwise inaccurate reading of a cancer screening sample as a notifiable incident. It does not matter how it was discovered, when it is discovered or what difference, if any, it would make to a patient's condition; there should be a duty of candour and a duty to make a disclosure because the patient has a right to know. The bottom line is that this is not giving everyone the right to information, unless they seek it. It does not place an obligation on a clinician to inform a patient of an error or mistake or even an inaccuracy. Whether it is minor, within a margin of error or negligent, there is no obligation on anyone to say anything. "We can be asked", is a very different starting point from, "We must tell". We have to protect the rights of the patients, which we see being eroded the length and breadth of our health service every day. There is doubt the Minister sees more than we do in his job. That is to our great shame and this country's great shame. When it comes to those with responsibility, it is on them to ensure the patient gets the truth. The burden cannot and should not be placed on the patient to ask that vital question at that moment in time. One cannot expect everything of the person who has been told she has cancer and nothing on the system. I ask myself if this Bill had been in place back in the day, would it have prevented the cervical smear scandal? I do not think it would have. I fundamentally disagree with the Minister on that. I do not believe it would have. Open disclosure is vital. We do not need another system that compounds hurt. We have the obligation this evening to do the right thing and ensure that no deaths, loss or suffering have been in vain.

We have an opportunity and a grave responsibility to get it right. As everyone has said, there is no issue with the Bill itself and I welcome the amendments that have been tabled. Everyone across this House is attempting to do the right thing. We cannot leave this Bill without doing the right thing.The question which seems to be glaring is: why is the system fighting against transparency and truthfulness? If there is one thing we can inject into the health service, it is that transparency. We have to get away from the position where the system is being protected and the patient does not come first. This has happened in so many matters. We have an opportunity and a responsibility to insert the duty of candour into the Bill. We cannot have self-regulation of issues and we cannot put the responsibility on patients to come forward all the time. We cannot expect the person to do everything and the system to fail them time and again.  I wish to speak to the wider issue of protected disclosures. This morning I raised the matter with the Taoiseach of protected disclosures that are in at the moment relating to the Western Care Association in County Mayo. Current and former staff within that organisation were brave enough to come forward to express concerns they had about the services. I wrote to the Minister some time last week. These matters arrived on my desk after I had read about them on the front page of The Mayo News. There are serious issues that need to be addressed. The reply I received to the parliamentary question that I tabled on the protected disclosures states: "The HSE does not share protected disclosures with the Department, therefore I am referring this to the HSE." I am concerned about that because we have to have accountability. We have to address these issues and give reassurance to families, service users and patients around how things will be handled. This afternoon I asked for a number of things to be done. I want to acknowledge the great work that is done by people in the HSE across the board and people within the Western Care Association. There are some excellent people who go above and beyond to protect the rights of those for whom they care. I have seen them do that throughout Covid-19 and outside of Covid-19. We have to have confidence in the system that if people working within that system see something wrong that they come forward. We have to change the culture of protecting the system. We must encourage people to come forward. I want the Minister to guarantee that nobody will lose his or her job, that nobody will be exiled for coming forward with concerns and that families are not going to be disadvantaged by it, not only the families of the service users but also the families waiting to access the individualised services within the Western Care Association who desperately need those services. I am concerned that there is not an immediacy and there is not a completely independent and transparent process that can be taken up straightaway. However, this is not new. When the Wolfe report was done on the Western Care Association, one of the recommendations was to escalate individualised services to the organisation risk register. It pointed out significant risks. That was two years ago. The problem is that things are not done in a timely manner. I am still concerned that things do not happen. I need somebody to deal with this, to put up their hand and say, “I will deal with that”. The buck stops with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on this. I just want them to be open and transparent and for us in Mayo to have confidence in a service and an organisation that does so much good work. When matters are brought to our attention, we all have a duty of care. When they arrived on my desk I had a duty of care. I do not like doing this because of all the workers who are there but I have a duty of care to do that.  Does the Minister know that the same thing happened regarding the Valproate issue? I thank him for announcing the inquiry, for which we were grateful at the time. However, it is two years he announced there would be an inquiry as to who knew what, when they knew it and why nobody did anything about it when women were prescribed Epilim when there was a tonne of evidence to say what the impact would be on their unborn children. Hundreds of children and families throughout the State have been impacted by this. Children have been born with disabilities. The terms of reference for the inquiry have been agreed. We have one Cabinet meeting remaining. I ask the Minister to bring this to Cabinet to get that inquiry up and running. These are all examples of cases where nobody shouted “Stop”. Harm is being done. We have to stop harm being done in the health system. This is one such opportunity where we can stop harm being done by getting this legislation right. If we fail to get it right it will be a case of shame on all of us. I ask the Minister to listen. I do not always agree with Deputy Kelly but he said it is not fit for purpose and that it does not pass the Vicky test. I did not know Vicky Phelan but I do not think that this passes the Vicky test either. We have to honour her name and her courage by getting the Bill right and ensuring these things never happen again. That way the Minister would be acknowledged for doing that within the system and for being the one Minister for Health who shouted "Stop".

That is how bad society is that we cannot take it as a given that when somebody, whether a clinician, a medic or even a company, discovers an error or misreading of such a vital test as a cervical smear test that they would immediately inform the patient. That there was an immediacy about that. The problem as we know far too well, and some people know to their detriment, is that there have been failures in the system not just here but abroad when we relied on public or private companies but even moreso when we relied on private companies and outsourced the smear test analytics, especially to companies that had been found guilty of fraud in the past. Back in 2008 I had the argument with the then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, opposing the outsourcing and the undermining of public laboratories in this city, and how that very move would undermine our ability to ensure testing would be carried out at the highest possible level. What was worse at the time was that the company that was granted the contract at the time, Quest, had paid out and was to pay out after that quite substantial amounts in a variety of fraud cases that it faced in America, some of which were because it defrauded the American State itself. Mar atá sé ráite ag daoine eile romham, níl fadhb againn leis an mBille seo nó leis na leasuithe. Táimid ag caint faoi bhfadhb bunúsach, sé sin an dualgas a bheith oscailte, agus nach bhfuil sé seo ar fáil sa Bhille. Mar a dúirt mé ansin, níor chóir go mbeadh muid ag déileáil le seo nó go mbeadh muid ag plé rud a ghlactar leis gur chóir a bheith uathoibríoch. It should be automatic that when an error is spotted in a medical procedure, it is immediately notified and, in particular, notified to the patient. That is what we are talking about. That is who we are talking about in the first instance. As others mentioned, self-regulation does not work. It has not worked.We were here last night talking about self-regulation in the construction industry and we have seen the cost that has led to for the State. It is not the same cost as in this case, where it can be fatal, or while construction defects can also be fatal, these issues can be fatal very quickly. Patients need to know as quickly as possible what medical care they need, whether they need a new test, whether they need a course of medication and if that medication addresses the cancer. We are always told that the earlier a cancer is identified, the greater the chances are. If there is any delay or any hiding of results or mistakes in tests, as would be the case given the Minister is adamant about an anonymous programme audit, that could make the issue worse because we would not identify where the errors are, or we might identify errors but not the person who was the subject of the error. As I said, the information should be immediate. We should expect nothing less, given what Dr. Gabriel Scally’s report, the survivors and those who are no longer with us outlined as they watched this issue unfold over recent years. Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, caithfidh an dualgas a bheith orthu siúd atá ag obair sna labs ar fad thar lear, agus fiú amháin orthu siúd atá ag obair anseo in Éirinn sna hoifigí leis na comhlachtaí atá ag próiseáil na dtrialacha nó na dtorthaí sin. Is orainn ar fad a bheith oscailte nuair atá botúin déanta. Tá níos mó measa ag daoine orainn nuair a dhéanaimid é sin agus sa chás seo is é an rud atá á dhéanamh ná an rún diamhair nó an rún féin a chothú sa phróiseas atá leagtha amach anseo, i dtreo is nach mbeidh muinín ag daoine sa chóras atá os ár gcomhair. Beidh botúin eile ann, beidh míchruinneas, agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh mná ag casadh ó na trialacha seo a fháil toisc nach bhfuil muinín acu iontu. One of the key things we need to ensure is that those who are going for cervical smear tests have confidence and if there is anything that will undermine that confidence, we need to address it. I believe that, without the duty of candour, the proposal before us will undermine the confidence of women who are going for these tests. We need to address that and make sure they have full confidence that where errors, mistakes or missed readings are identified, they will be informed straightaway. If there is any doubt of that, or if that does not happen, confidence erodes and the whole system based around cervical smear tests begins to erode and fail.

They are made every day, as we know, but doctors do not only make mistakes, and they make positive calls in regard to diagnosis in the majority of cases. What is galling for many people and what they do not accept is that the truth behind mistakes being made is denied to them. That is the nub of the issue for many of us in the Opposition. The real fear I have about the legislation is that we are cementing a system that allows errors and inaccurate readings to be swept away and never disclosed to patients. It locks in a system that was already in place in 2014 when the CervicalCheck smears were missed. Under this Bill, as I read it, there will be no obligation on anyone to disclose that they ever made a mistake. Maybe I am wrong on that, but that is my reading of it. What are survivors saying about the Bill? They are not expressing confidence in it, that is for sure. The question I am asking is whether we have learned anything. Patients could be left for years not knowing what is wrong with them or why they are feeling unwell. I can talk about my own situation. I knew at one stage that I was not well. I went into the medical system and I was told that clear was white, cancer was black and, in my situation, I was grey. For many years, that is what I was told by the system. I went for an MRI at one time and I was told not to worry and to come back in 12 months. I still knew there was something wrong and I knew my own body, so I went to try to get a second opinion. I went for another biopsy. When I was getting the second biopsy, which I did not particularly want as it was very uncomfortable, I was told that I would not get a second opinion. Lo and behold, after that biopsy it turned out I had cancer, and that is when my story began. Mistakes were made along the road but I do not think anyone ever came to me and said they made a mistake on that. Clearly, the MRI was read wrongly and if I had accepted that, I probably would not be here to speak tonight. Mistakes are made. The waiting list crisis is such that if someone has a misread or erroneous scan, it will take months or even years to secure another one. I can give an example of someone I know who was in the hospital system. He had worked all his life. He had what they called a broken back and he was in extreme pain and on morphine-based medication which he tried to come off. He learned two years later that he was supposed to get pain injections and due to an oversight, he never got them. Again, mistakes are made. Half of cancer treatment is learning to live with cancer, the effects on the body and how to fight the worst of its effects. The big journey for a lot of people is getting that news and how they respond. It cannot be said often enough that patients need absolute candour from the medical professionals who are in charge of their care. Real harm is done in the absence of candour. The question we are asking is why we are going down this path. The system does protect itself. It is hard to get one doctor or clinician to go against another, as we know. In many cases, people have to go to Britain or abroad to get one to give evidence against the other, and there is a cost involved in that. We heard this week of the fear that some clinicians have about litigation and being sued, and we know how much the State Claims Agency pays out each year. The question is whether we are bound by that. Is that the reason we are not opting for absolute candour? As I said, the system protects itself. The system can afford the best of lawyers. There is no balance in regard to the people taking those cases because the power is on the side of the State. Is it the case that candour has been put on the back burner in regard to this legislation? If so, we are forgetting that patients’ needs must also come first. I do not understand how this Bill serves those needs. It may be better than nothing but there is a great deal that can be done to improve it. That is why we are all here tonight. The House is split on this issue. I believe many on our side of the House and on the Minister’s side share these concerns. While we might say patients can always ask for a review, why is the burden placed on the cancer patient to ask the questions of their doctor or consultant? When many people hear they have cancer, they cannot think of anything else and their mind goes blank. When people are landed with a cancer diagnosis, who is going to be thinking about a Part 5 review or anonymous audits? Patients need to have full confidence in the medical system. They need to have faith in our doctors, nurses and consultants.I do not believe the Bill gives anyone confidence. What has changed? That is the question hanging over us tonight. What have we learned? I am sure there are people at home watching these proceedings who are asking the same. It is a fair question.

We talked about what would happen and what would be done for women. The Minister has a unique chance to bring in legislation that covers all situations. I have no doubt he would have the backing of all Deputies on this side of the House if he did so. I listened to most of the debate from my office. It has been repeated all evening that no one has an issue with the Bill or the amendments. The problem is the way the Minister is dealing with the Bill, as well as the absence of a statutory duty of candour. That can be changed very easily. It can be changed tonight by the Minister. The Bill places no obligation on a provider or anyone else to inform a patient of his or her right to Part 5 at the point of diagnosis. There has to be a system for notifying patients of their rights. That could be done through the National Cancer Registry. The Bill does not specify that the Minister should prescribe how the review is done. It is like self-regulation. The Government does not need to be reminded by Members on this side of the House where self-regulation got it with housing, banking and all that. The last thing we want in this situation is for self-regulation to lead us down a road down which no one wants to take. The Bill does not even include the discovery of something having gone wrong or an inaccurate reading of a cancer screening sample as a notifiable incident. The Minister might be able to explain to us why that is so. How or when it is discovered should not matter in this context, although it might make a difference to a patient's condition. There should be a duty to make a disclosure. All the women to whom we have spoken have the right to know that information. There should be no question about that. If this legislation was in place in 2014, Lorraine Walsh, Vicky Phelan and all the other women would not have been informed of any wrong that was done or any wrong reading. They would not have been able to see it in their files. It would not have been discovered until they asked for a review. Has the Minister not listened to any of the survivors? They have said it is like the tribunal all over again for some of them. Nothing will change. They would have to look for a review. That is not what they want. They have made that clear to us over here and I am sure they have done likewise to those on the other side of the House. In the words of another Deputy, if this legislation had been in place in 2014, nobody would have found out what was going on with CervicalCheck. The bottom line is that it is not giving patients the right to information unless they seek it. That should not be the case. The last thing on the mind of patients who get that sort of diagnosis is to ask those kinds of questions. The Bill does not place an obligation on a clinician or providers to inform patients when an error has been made or discovered. They should be big enough to bring that information forward straight away, and the legislation should be there to ensure that happens. It should not matter whether it is a minor error within a particular margin of error or a severe negligent misreading. If there is no obligation on anybody to reveal that they found something wrong, nothing will change and we will have the same conversations over and over again. The biggest scandal is that if we do not introduce regulations now to ensure the information has to be given to patients, we will finish up back here again. The Minister can argue that the anonymised audit means it is not possible to identify a patient whose slide reading is discordant, but that would be possible if the system was designed to allow for it, especially in the case of a severe misreading that is outside the acceptable margin of error. Patients have to be at the heart of this. I agree that we must protect the viability of some of the services. There will be approximately 250,000 CervicalCheck screenings this year, and that is welcome, but the rights of patients have to be protected and that has to come across in the legislation with which we finish up. The burden of responsibility for ensuring the patient gets the truth should not be placed on the people who have cancer. They should not have to ask those kinds of questions. The burden must be placed on the clinician and providers to produce the evidence to the patient. I am not going to say much more because I am only repeating much of what has been already said. In the words of a specialist who provides counselling and support for women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal, the State pays lip service to acknowledging its mistakes, yet systematic failures are blocking and resisting change, which is causing ongoing heartache and trauma. The bottom line is that it keeps adding to the suffering of the women they meet. It is in the power of the Minister to ensure that this legislation is done as Vicky Phelan and others asked for it to be done and that no other woman goes through what she did. She fought right to the end for herself, and especially for others in the system. The Minister has a chance to change the Bill and to do the right thing by these women. I appeal to him not to let them down, as previous Ministers have done. I ask him to ensure that a statutory duty of candour is included in the Bill. This is his opportunity to make a good statement, one that can be supported by all on this side of the House.

It is about transparency and ensuring mistakes of the past are not repeated. A doctor or clinician should be obliged to inform a patient of the right to a Part 5 review at the time of diagnosis, but that is not the case under the Bill. The Bill does not provide for a statutory duty of candour. It does not place an obligation on the doctor to inform the patient where an error was made or an inaccuracy discovered. It does not matter how big or small the error is; every woman has the right to know that information about a test result. We want to encourage as many women as possible to undergo smear tests and avail of screening but those doing so need to have confidence in the system. They have rights, and those rights must be protected. If mistakes are made by a doctor or service or the system, there must be a forthright acknowledgement of those mistakes. It is not fair to put the responsibility on the patient but place no obligation on the clinician or service to make an open disclosure where a mistake has been made. That applies to all screening services or tests of any sort, whether cancer screening or otherwise. The onus should not be on the patient to request a review, reply or explanation. It should be her right to receive that. The Minister argues that the anonymised audit means it will not be possible to identify a patient where a slide reading is discordant, but the system could be redesigned to allow for that, especially in the case of severe misreadings that are outside the accepted margin of error. So many people have been failed by the health service. The biggest hurt of all is the failure of the health service - the HSE or individual hospitals - to acknowledge mistakes, give people answers or issue an apology. Instead, people are being forced to go to court to get the truth. They are put through a lengthy legal process, often at a great financial cost but a bigger emotional toll, to get truth about an issue that affects them or their family. I have heard from families who lost children in childbirth or whose child is severely disabled due to mistakes made at the hospital. As well as dealing with the loss of a child in some cases, they are dealing with a wall of silence in respect of what happened. That forces them to go to court. The same is true for families whose members had organs retained without their knowledge or agreement. Again, they receive no answers. It is just not fair. There is a need to pass the Bill but we, as legislators, must ensure it is thorough before doing so. That will ensure the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated. We need a better system going forward and we need to give people confidence that the health system will be better in the future than it was in the past. Mistakes will be made, but they must be acknowledged, owned up to and explained to the people.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	258	As has been said by others, it is very important that we get this legislation right. It is important legally that we have clarity and we are clear procedurally that what we are agreeing to will work. This is because, of course, women and their families have had the awful experience of the CervicalCheck scandal but as my colleague, Deputy Tully, referred to, that is not the only scandal, and the only hardship and heartbreak, that has emerged as a result of the resistance of the system or systems to simply provide information. I recall that this legislation is all about the provision of information. It is not about malpractice, or establishing negligence or any of those things, which require separate legal processes, as the Minister is aware. In that spirit, we need to come at this looking to maximise information flow and access to information for the woman and the patient. I say that because, culturally, within the system the reflex action is not to tell. We have all of the evidence of that. I do not know whether the Minister agrees with that assessment but the evidence shows us that the system is conservative or anxious to protect itself, to protect its staff and not to tell. Furthermore, even when mistakes are established, the system's next reflex is to fight those odds, very often through the courts. The women and their families have had that experience. Indeed, some will go into court tomorrow on this. I understand Stephen Teap, the widower of the late Irene Teap, is in court tomorrow. Such legal action is the second instinct. We have to be very real in formulating this legislation. We have to provide the legal basis and the procedural certainty but we also have to be real about the culture in which this legislation will operate. The reason we are zoning in on this legislation and taking the Minister through his paces on it is simply that we want to be sure that we get it right. There are several parts of this legislation we do not believe that he has right yet. We want to work with the Minister to correct that. A positive duty of mandatory disclosure and candour places the onus and burden of responsibility on the system, clinician and service provider. That is what it does. If it simply places an onus or burden on the woman, or the patient in the case of other screening services, what is that? Not just legally but operationally, what does that say to the system? The right to review, which I acknowledge was widely consulted on and this is the advice the Minister has been given, is an excellent opportunity for women and patients. However, it is problematic that the legislation does not state, as a matter of obligation, that the woman or patient must be told and informed of their right to that review. The Minister should correct that in the legislation. His proposal to move to an anonymised - I struggle to say that word - look-back or audit is also problematic. If we think about it, in legislation and a system that is all about recognising the right of individuals - not numbers or statistics but real women and real patients - to their information, is there not something kind of ironic and almost inappropriate in anonymising, in totality, that process? That is a mistake. In fact, if we think about Vicky Phelan's experience, and her name echoes throughout this debate, had the look-back been anonymised at that stage and, of course, it was not, would the information regarding the error in reading her slide ever have found its way onto her medical records?

That review process is a separate issue. In an anonymised scenario, would that information have found its way onto her files? The answer to that question is "No".

If there is concern around an entirely anonymised system, a halfway house can be found on that. The Government can give women and patients choice in respect of any future look-backs as to whether their sample or slide would be anonymised. I suggest, and my instinct is, that most people, when we talk about information, clarity, transparency and accountability, would prefer that the system not be anonymised. I am not convinced by the argument, and I have heard it rehearsed, that if the look-back is not anonymised it will collapse the whole screening system. I do not buy that because I remember a time when all the controversy, and the women speaking out and defending their corner, was also cited as a potential danger, menace or jeopardy to the entire screening system. Not alone did that not prove to be the case, as a matter of fact, and the data reflected it, more not less women went for screening. All of us on all sides of the House, and Deputy Tully said it very clearly, want people to avail of the screening services. I hope the Minister will agree to further amendments to this legislation. I do not think he has got it to a point where we could, hand on heart, say this does the job. I had the opportunity to talk to some members, though not all, of the 221+ group. They share many of the concerns, and more concerns than I have expressed, in respect of this legislation. I appeal to the Minister to open his mind and move to correct the deficiencies in the legislation.

I acknowledge that is a constraint we have on Report Stage. Obviously, two minutes are not sufficient to address all the very reasonable issues raised. As I heard it, broadly, many different issues have been raised about many different parts of the Bill. I will confine my comments to Part 5, referenced in this amendment to the Bill, which we are speaking to. Essentially, what I think I heard expressed, maybe not by everybody but from colleagues around the House, is there is broad support for the Bill and the amendments. That has been stated repeatedly. Members do not have an issue with the Bill or the amendments. Two additional issues are being raised. One is around the programmatic audit and whether it should be anonymised or not. The second is around an obligation within the Bill, as opposed to an obligation within standard operating procedures of the HSE, to inform a patient - a man or a woman because this will apply to all screening services - of his or her right to a patient requested look-back, for which there has been broad support. I will try to deal with those issues. With the Acting Chair's indulgence and the agreement of the House, I will take a little longer-----

With regard to the look-back, the advice to Government and the Government position is being led by many years of domestic and international expertise, which indicates that programmatic audits are learning audits. We know they are now used all over the HSE in all manner of clinical areas every day.They are used by clinicians to get better at identifying patient safety issues, detecting cancers and so forth. They happen every day. At an informal meeting of the health committee today, there was a briefing at which Dr. Colm Henry, the HSE's chief clinical officer, made the point that anonymised audits were used as standard practice in health systems around the world. The Madden report in 2008 stated powerfully that our public health service had to have these learning or programmatic audits and that we always had to be improving what we were doing. It recommended anonymising audits. We have covered some of the reasons for that. I accept that there is no perfect answer to this situation and that reasonable points have been made across the floor. The advice at the time was to anonymise the audits. Importantly, the expert reference group that was set up following Dr. Scally's report strongly recommended anonymisation of the audits. The view of the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence, NICE, which is held in high regard internationally in this respect, is that audits should be anonymised. I asked officials to examine other countries around the world that were considered to be good at this. What I have heard back from country after country and institute after institute is that these audits should be anonymised. Probably of most importance is the fact that the WHO will publish a view on this matter early in the new year. Ireland and many other countries are involved in its work. We will wait to see what the WHO says, but the indication I have from my Department is that the WHO will also be suggesting that the audits be anonymised because they are learning audits. We have discussed several reasons for doing this, one of which is that clinicians need access to all of the data. They use aggregated data. Dr. Henry stated that people used a great deal of different information. It may be information that no one sought consent for or information that we do not need today but clinicians decide in five years' time is useful. It means that the people running the audits and our doctors have access to the widest possible amount of information so that they can provide the best quality service for patients. There are other reasons. Deputy Shortall asked whether we had a sense of whether patients who were given the choice in the UK actually wanted a review of their slides. I believe the officials stated that approximately 40% to 50% of women said "Yes". Critically, the other 60% or 50% did not. If we conduct audits on an ongoing basis - they should be done across the system every day - and we do not anonymise them, the patient must be told if discordance and errors are found. However, approximately half of those patients might never have wanted to know that information. This is something that we must balance. There is no perfect answer, but the answer is to put it entirely in the power of the patient. Everyone has supported the patient review process that is in place. There has been a reasonable request that we amend the Bill to make that mandatory. We do not normally legislate at that level of operating procedure, but we are all aware that there is a unique context to this. Various Deputies referenced the culture. It is changing. Deputy McDonald asked whether I have faith in a culture of open disclosure. I believe that many important changes have been, and are being, made. In terms of open disclosure and culture, for example, we have this Bill. It will not answer everything, but it plays an important part. Once the Bill is in place in January, the HSE will publish a new national framework. Ms Noeline Blackwell is chairing and leading that work. The HSE's open disclosure policy will be updated in line with the framework and the framework will be cognisant of this Bill. There is a national open disclosure office now when there was none previously. There is also mandatory open disclosure training within the HSE now. I am happy that more than 90% of clinicians have undergone this training, but that figure needs to be 100%. The professional bodies-----

Is that agreed? Agreed.

In his latest report, or perhaps it was in a conversation I had with him before he published that report, Dr. Scally stated that some of those guidelines should be better and tighter. This is another matter that can be examined. HIQA's standards are being updated with a view to the new national framework. We have the patient advocacy service, which Deputy Cullinane references in some of his amendments. This service is being invested in more and its remit is expanding. Yesterday, Dr. Henry launched a new HSE process, entitled "Better Together: The Health Services Patient Engagement Roadmap", which is concerned with creating a culture within our public health service whereby our healthcare professionals work hand in hand with patients. Is all of this perfect and has everything been done? No, but I hope that colleagues will agree that it represents a real effort by the HSE to do things differently and to acknowledge the shortcomings of the past. This brings us back to an earlier point. Given the circumstances, I would be open to amending the Bill to make it an obligation that the patient be told. While I accept there are different views on programmatic audits, the Bill's provisions will at least address the fact that such audits are for learning. We can have different views on whether they should be anonymised. For every discordance, all patients on every screening programme would be told that this appropriate process, which they were in control of, was available. Part 5 would make it mandatory that the results be disclosed to the patients. We are on Report Stage. I have had a quick chat with the officials about whether we can make a simple amendment or if it will require something more complex. I would need a little time - I do not know how much yet - to discuss this matter and for the Department to work through it. One option might be to amend the Bill in the Seanad, after which it would return to the Dáil. Another option might be to amend it next week in the Dáil. With the best will in the world, and if we were all agreeable to making such an amendment, my sense is that it would probably push the Bill's final stages and its signing by the President into January. We could do it quickly. I would be curious to know what Deputies think. No one is trying to play politics this evening. We have to get this right. We cannot do everything that everyone wants - various Deputies have been clear on what they believe and we have heard the views of patient advocates - but there may be ways of amending the Bill to reflect some of what people have called for. However, I will not reflect calls where the international expert advice I have states that the patient safety call means anonymised audits. I am curious about colleagues' opinions. While we may get the Bill through next week, that may not be possible, given the timelines. We have all made commitments. When Deputy McDonald asked the Taoiseach, he gave a commitment. He took it seriously, which is one of the reasons we are debating the Bill now and are scheduled to debate it again next week. If we all agreed it would be okay to move the Bill to January, we should consider doing so.

I welcome the fact that there has been movement on this issue. This makes sense because it places a legal obligation on the clinician to inform a woman who is diagnosed with cancer - which would involve trauma for any woman, or for any patient for that matter - that there is now this entitlement. This is an important amendment and we would support it. If it takes until January to do it, then the women, and patients generally, would say it would be better to get this right rather than rushing it through now. My view is that if this is what it takes, this is what we should do. It is unsatisfactory that we are in this situation and that I have just two minutes to respond. We are all limited in our time because this is Report Stage. To return to the anonymised audit, it seems we are not going to agree on this. The Minister said that up to 50% of women may not want to know if there is a discordant reading. He may be correct; I do not know. I imagine it may be higher in Ireland because of what happened in CervicalCheck. Whatever the percentage, there are some women who may not want to know if there is a discordant reading. For this reason, it would be wrong to have an unanonymised system. The opposite of this, however, concerns the question of what happens in the case of the 50% of women who want to know. We are not giving them a choice other than through this patient-initiated system. There is no automatic obligation on the system to inform women if there is a discordant reading. I have spoken to the Minister about what I think is a logical system. We can create whatever system we think is best for us, including a bespoke system that creates a choice to opt in or to opt out. If there is a discordant reading and the system comes across it, for whatever reason, whether as part of a look-back, an audit or a lab coming across an error in any other part of its work, the question asked would be whether the patient wishes to be informed. This would give the women a choice and it would have been a better system. It is regrettable that the Minister is not minded to accept this suggestion. However, I acknowledge that the amendment the Minister is proposing is one we would support.

All this debate and the discussion earlier at the briefing indicate that this is an exceptionally complex matter. It is, literally, one of life and death. It goes to the heart of some significant issues within healthcare, the right to know and the duty of candour. It underlines how inappropriately this has been handled in the sense of being rushed and all these amendments being supplied to us at the last minute, with no briefing and no pre-legislative scrutiny. I have two amendments in this grouping, which are somewhat different, but I would like to add my voice to the statement that it is more important for us to get this right than to do it quickly. If the Minister is proposing opening this legislation up again and allowing for proper interaction, perhaps outside this House, by way of briefings etc., or perhaps in the Joint Committee on Health, that would probably be a better way to tease out the implications of the legislation, with a view to getting it passed by January. I am certainly in favour of that approach. Regarding my amendments to the Minister's amendment No. 19, concerning the statement in respect of the procedure for open disclosure under Part 5, where section 41(2), without prejudice to the generality of section 76, states now that the Minister "may" make guidelines, I am proposing that the "may" be changed to "should". Similarly, regarding section 51(1), concerning the review information, where the text reads that a health service provider "may" at any time during the holding of a Part 5 review provide information on the guidelines, my amendment would change this to "should". I propose that these two changes be made to put the onus on the healthcare provider, rather than leaving it open where it may be argued. This is also vague, and there should be no place for vagueness in this legislation.

Without meaning to point fingers, or anything like that, this may be some acknowledgement that a bit more time is going to be needed to get this right. I am minded to recall what was said earlier regarding Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh. They have said that this legislation does not pass what was referred to as the Vicky test. If it is the case that we are agreed that we can work together, and it was said I do not know how many times during this debate that nobody wants to get this wrong and that we all want to get it right, I am still reminded of the debate on the termination of pregnancy legislation, which the Minister might well remember. We all came under tremendous pressure then to get it done, get it in and do it quickly. Now, we are returning to the legislation to talk about safe access zones. I submitted an amendment on safe access zones which we did not get to and which was not discussed. Indeed, we were pressured by outside organisations, as was the Minister, that quite disgracefully encouraged and urged us and twisted our arms up our collective backs to withdraw amendments we knew were good ones and represented the right thing to do. We are now back again to try to legislate for safe access zones. We need to dispense with the practice of trying to rush Bills through at the end of every year, even if what we are dealing with concerns good and worthwhile projects and everybody wants to get them done. We need to take time to reflect on this legislation, to get things right and to be mindful of what Lorraine and Stephen are saying concerning what they want, because they have been through this. They are the people, as well as the medical and legal experts, who must be our guiding lights in this process. If we are recognising that a bit more work needs to be done, then this is welcome. Everybody here has, I think, indicated they are willing to work with the Minister. I am very much conscious that we attempted to make amendments to legislation previously and now these amendments have to be revisited. This is happening now, when we could and should have done this earlier and taken the time to get it right.

In fairness, Deputy O'Reilly has stated that where mistakes have been made previously, there is no room for shortcuts. We must ensure we deliver on the promise we owe to Vicky Phelan and to many others who have been failed. We must also ensure that we instil some level of confidence in the necessity of having the CervicalCheck programme and cancer screening in general. Like everybody else, I welcome the Minister having come part of the road by accepting that we need to lay down in the legislation that there is an obligation on the clinician, or the system, at the point of a cancer diagnosis to ensure patients will be told. There should be no doubt whatsoever that it would be a necessity for patients to be told that the option of a Part 5 review is open to them. In fairness, Deputy Cullinane has dealt with the point that we are still not particularly happy regarding the anonymised audits. I understand the point the Minister is making concerning the necessary lessons to be taken on board by the system and by wider systems. We are talking about data analytics that are absolutely necessary. It is far from impossible, however, that anywhere between 40% and 60% of women who use these services might be quite happy and might want to get the details of results, even regarding the terrible news of a discordant reading. If we are going to take the time, and the necessary time, to ensure we have a fit-for-purpose system, we must look at all the questions which exist. We owe this to the many women who have been failed over many years. We must ensure we deliver a system that is fit for purpose. I welcome that we are somewhat further along the journey now than we were earlier.

It has been clearly a worthwhile endeavour to have the additional time to debate and tease this out. The Opposition has had an opportunity to clearly articulate the position and the reservations that exist. I suppose it is not only this one reservation; there are several others and we will return to some of them. The Minister has comprehended that and is reacting. We will have to see in black and white exactly what that means and how that will work through the process. In relation to the point about the anonymised and semi-anonymised audits, if we are moving to a greater element of candour at one end, we need to make sure the system is fully geared towards that at the back end as well. The semi-anonymisation is more in keeping with the spirit of that but it is preferable in more practical terms too. The other point I would make - the Minister has acknowledged it to some extent in the context of the first proposed amendment he is considering - is that the circumstances here are different than they would be in other places. The public confidence issues are significant but within that, there is scope for this jurisdiction to be a leader. The Minister has expressed that desire on numerous occasions. We want to make sure that our learnings from everything that happened to the late Vicky Phelan, the late Emma Mhic Mhathúna and their families gives us the platform to have one of the best systems. In any decision that we are making, of course we need to be conscious of international evidence, etc., but we should also be conscious of our ambition for the screening programme.

I am asking that this be addressed also. What I really want to say is there should be an obligation on the provider clinician - I am glad that the Minister has mentioned that - to inform a patient of her right to a Part 5 review at the point of diagnosis. We owe it to Lorraine Walsh and Vicky Phelan, and all those other women, to do the right thing. We cannot expect everything of the person with the cancer and nothing of the system. The responsibility is to ensure the person gets the truth. We must ensure we do that. We are elected to this House by people who want us to do a job. By sitting here and not getting this legislation right, we are doing the electorate a disservice. We cannot continue to do this. We cannot continue to rush through legislation for the sake of rushing it through and not get it right. I welcome what the Minister stated about the obligation.

I appreciate what the Minister stated about anonymising the audits and the difficulty in identifying slides. I wonder if there is any possibility of redesigning that system and looking at it again. I appreciate that the Minister is willing to look at another amendment. This stands out for me as well because Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who was from Leixlip and was one of the women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal, is buried in Laraghbryan graveyard in Maynooth. We lined the road when her coffin was coming out to Maynooth. I mentioned the CervicalCheck scandal on several occasions this evening, but it stands out as a turning point. We want this duty of candour. Women want to know. I am interested in seeing how the Minister will be able to look at this again. I will be following it.

It was not too long ago we were arguing about the duty of candour. I recognise that the Minister will look at the Part 5 review and strengthen that. What this House is about is debating it. We are all trying to sing from the same hymn sheet here. I was a little surprised when the Minister was on about the 50:50 for yea and nay on the audits. That is something, I suppose, that can be tweaked. One of the other speakers mentioned going back to the Select Committee on Health with some of this. The Minister said he is worried about the timeframe. It is a sensitive Bill but if it needs time, we should treat it with that respect. As I said, my big bugbear here is still whether we can put the duty of candour on a statutory basis. We need this Bill to be as strong as possible. As I stated previously, there is very little oversight within the HSE. There is very little responsibility. If something goes wrong, nobody is held accountable. We need that accountability. We need that strength in the background. As I said at the start, I am looking forward to the debate so that we can get something right. If we get this wrong, it is a legacy that all of us will have to live with. I would much prefer if we tweaked this out a lot more and continued the discussion. Hopefully, this Bill will come out as one of the best Bills that ever came out of the House and serve the people of this country. That is what we are supposed to do.

I welcome that there seems to be some movement on the part of the Minister but the devil will be in the detail. Programmatic audits are not a new concept in the HSE or elsewhere. The question is what those programmatic audits trigger. When individual errors or issues are identified, what does that trigger? We need to be careful to recognise that these audit processes are not a new concept. They have been designed and used for the development of learning organisations, and for the improvement of systems, screening programmes or whatever else it may be, but we want a cultural change here. We want to ensure that at the heart of those system decisions is a recognition that there is a human there - a patient who is an individual - and it is her information as much as it is the learning system's information. There is work to be done. It would be some progress to see an automatic need to notify people but we need to stress-test that with those people who have direct dreadful experience of the existing system. I hope the Minister will be open to that type of discussion in the time ahead.

It is interesting that the Minister has moved in the past couple of hours when he should have moved much earlier. As I said in my earlier contribution when I mentioned the final Scally report, this has been well flagged as a serious and fundamental ask of this legislation. We are happy to give it extra time in order to get it right. We are talking about going into January. What does that mean? What are the modalities of how we go from this moment to getting this right? Is it going back to committee? Is it coming back here?

The way we do our business in this House is unsatisfactory at the best of times.The Minister was given additional time to explain his thinking within two minutes. He got another two minutes but it is still a bit unclear. I welcome the fact the Minister moved on the candour issue and that it will go to the Seanad. Like everything else we would like to see what wording or what way the Minister will bring the candour issue. When I spoke earlier, I make the point that this is not only about the past. It has to be about the future and how we do things. It is about people trusting the system, trusting those working within the system and making sure that if people make a mistake they can admit to it. I opened by saying that I do not think anyone believes doctors are infallible, including doctors themselves, although we would imagine that some clinicians believe that they are the centre of the universe and they know everything. Most patients look at this fairly. They believe that mistakes can be made. If mistakes can be made people should be able to admit to them within the system and put up their hands up and say so. People mentioned the litigation route that some patients have gone down. Most people I have spoken to who went down that route may have been satisfied that they won the case but there is no real satisfaction at the end of the day. They are still left with the life-changing injury, the loss of a loved one or on medication for the rest of their lives. It is clear the system is broken and needs to be fixed. This is what the legislation is about. I welcome the fact the Minister has listened to us tonight and moved on this.

It is extremely important that we get it right. It is welcome that the Minister has expressed willingness to engage and hear the concerns that have been raised. I have to say this has been too long coming. Regardless, we should all accept that if this takes an extra number of weeks to get a Bill that will pass unanimously through the House with the enthusiastic and full backing of all Members this is what we should absolutely do. I have to say I never had the privilege of meeting Vicky Phelan but her legacy is phenomenal. Her name has been referenced many times this evening, including by a number of Members who knew her personally and who are deeply affected by her loss. In many ways, the Bill is a testament to her. Her legacy is ensuring that we are raising concerns not only for her but for all those who follow and all those who may have been impacted. This is very powerful and I hope it comes as some solace to those who knew and loved her and to all of those who have campaigned and brought what it is a deeply personal and tragic set of circumstances into the public domain, not for themselves but for others. It is a very powerful statement of intent. As I said earlier, I hope our deliberations this evening will force a rethink on the part of the HSE at long last. There are multiple areas in respect of which scandals have yet to be uncovered. Where scandals have been raised the HSE's instinctive reaction at every occasion is to delay, frustrate, hide and block. This needs to change. It can only change with political determination at Government level.

It does not happen often, so fair play to him. One issue has been raised this evening that I raised on a previous occasion. I refer to anonymisation. I have spent hours outside of the Chamber because I have been speaking to people trying to get some sort of compromise. Politically, it would be the best if we could all sign up to this. I am sure everyone agrees. We need to reach a compromise on this. From conversations I have just had, I think we could come up with a process for anonymisation but we need time to agree something. I do not have the time to get into it here. It is very technical. I would like for us to deal with anonymisation and the process for it. I get what the Minister is saying about auditing, the data process and the requirement to have a full picture. I get that. It is about knowing that women will get the information to which they are entitled. I have spoken about this previously. We need to do something about notifiable incidents. I trust the Minister on this issue. I believe he will do something on it. The process by which the laboratories provide information is a concern. Another issue I keep raising is the audits done from January 2018 until now. These involve 1,500 women. We must remember that no variables have changed. In view of the level of analysis, therefore, this means that some women have passed away. The House is willing to facilitate this legislation. People do not mind if it goes into January as long as it is better and good legislation. The Minister mentioned the Seanad. I am not sure that is the right way to do this.

I am asking that even if we do not deal with the matter next week, we take time and allow for consultation with people to provide proper amendments that will help the Minister. I would rather the Bill go into January and get it right than bring it back next week. I do not believe doing it through the Seanad is the right way to go. The Minister might advise us.

I also welcome his candour. It is clear that the Minister is listening. With regard to anonymisation and having listened to Deputy Kelly, regardless of whether that it is to be done here or in the Seanad, we have to take another step and ensure that people can sign up to what is in the Bill. That is very important. The whole debate is very important. It is very important that the Bill is right. Families will understand if it takes a bit longer as long as we get it right. This is key. The devil is always in the detail. It is important that the Minister spells out the detail relating to anonymisation. Patients need to be elevated above the processes. As I mentioned earlier, the public does not have confidence in the health system, the cancer screening process or the CervicalCheck process. There is a serious lack of confidence among the public in this regard. This is why it is very important that the details of the Bill are done right.. I mentioned earlier a woman who wrote to me about finding out about what was done in the operation she had. We cannot allow this to happen again in any area of the health system.

I again appeal to the Minister to at least keep an open mind on a programmatic audit. He does not need to convince anyone here on the learning, educational value or the need for metadata. We could have a much more progressive and nuanced approached to this in which the need to use the data speaks to a consent issue for patients and women, which can be catered for but, critically, there must be an element of choice. There are people who do not wish to know should an error be discovered, and that is fine. An opt-out clause could be included. As a person who uses the CervicalCheck service, I would want to know and I would not like the idea that I would be prevented from the opportunity of knowing because the system is anonymised. I know the legislation is silent on this issue but collectively we need to do a bit of work on that too. As Deputy Kelly said, and this has been my experience, there is unease on this issue to say the very least. We are grateful for a meeting of minds on the need to have a positive legal obligation in terms of the patient-triggered review. It is important the amendment on this is brought forward and we do not believe the Seanad is the right forum for that. We have proposed this matter be adjourned. We know the Minister cannot tell us now across the floor, but we ask that he establish with his officials how long it will take for the relevant amendment to be tabled. It would then be the job of this House, in the first instance, to get this matter dealt with. Even though we are talking about January, I would hope we are not talking about dragging this on unnecessarily. We have made good progress this evening and there is more work to be done, but we are not in favour of passing this up. The Dáil needs to get it right.

I acknowledge and welcome the fact he has accepted the need to amendment the Bill at this late stage and to ensure women are informed of their right to seek a review. Others across the House have said that this does not normally happen in respect of legislation and debates, but this is a very different debate and we all understand this. We have a significant responsibility and burden on behalf of everyone who was wronged and those who have gone before us to make sure this is right. That is the key issue. We need to get it right and we have an opportunity here to do right. There has been a huge amount of campaigning and personal sacrifice which has led to these moments, so I strongly urge the Minister to listen to the proposals that have been put forward. The Dáil is the place to deal with this. There are people here who have the expertise and have been involved in campaigning on this issue for many years. That is no reflection on the Seanad. The Seanad will deal its issues. We need to ensure the amendment on informing of the right to a review, which the Minister intends to bring forward, is appropriate in the first instance. There is another issue. When we pare all of this back, at the end of the day, even with that amendment, which is welcome and we have argued for it, it still places the responsibility on the individual, and that is a serious issue. When this was announced several weeks ago, after the death of Vicky Phelan, everybody believed it was important we get this right and there would be transparency and a duty of candour, but I never thought it would be a case of, "If you ask, we will tell you." If there is an identifiable misreading of a test, through a programmatic audit or otherwise, that information should be provided to the individual, and that is the core we need to get to. We need to make sure information that could be provided to the individual is not being withheld. Unfortunately, even with the advancement of this amendment, that would be the case. Individuals would only be informed that there has been a misreading of their test if they seek the review. Unfortunately, cancer has touched so many of our lives. We do not know how the process by which that information will be provided. Will it be as people are sitting down to be told of their diagnosis and in the middle of their world collapsing around them that they are told? That puts a responsibility on individuals. There should be an onus to tell, to inform, to be transparent and to disclose provided for in the legislation. The onus should not be on the patient to request this. While making sure the review is provided for, which we acknowledge is an advancement and we welcome it, it does not take away from the fact there must be an onus to inform. I strongly urge the Minister, in the spirit in which he has accepted the arguments put forward by my colleagues on the Opposition benches on the right to review and to be informed of that right, to look at this, as the debate has evolved, in terms of being patient and individual-centred and stepping into their shoes. In terms of programmatic audits, we can design the types of audits that will allow anonymised audits, but it is to be able to trace where a mistake has been identified and to inform the individual. I take the point that some people may not want to be informed, and that is why the argument for an opt-in system is very simple, to tick the box when asked whether a person wants to be informed if it were the case. The information that is accessible at a point should be divulged to the individual. I always understood, along with those who have campaigned and argued for this, the concept would be that of open disclosure. It would not be open disclosure if an individual has to request a review and perhaps is told at a traumatic and difficult time. We still do not know how an individual would be informed, whether it would be by letter or as part of the consultation. The key issue is that responsibility needs to be on the system and not on the individual patient. I strongly urge the Minister to deal with that second matter.

I also acknowledge the co-operation from across the House. Everyone who speaks on this subject is very genuine in wanting to get this right. On the issue of anonymisation, I am a woman and I would want to be informed. I absolutely do not want to be a dot on a scatter plot nor a confidence interval. I do not want to be a statistic. I would want to know. Other women may not. It is very important this is dealt with, and dealt with in the Dáil and not in the Seanad. I was a Member of the Seanad and I mean no disrespect, but we cannot pass the buck on this occasion. The Minister has the co-operation to be able to deal with all these issues. We need a health service we can be proud of. What Vicky Phelan did in the courage and bravery she showed permeates through the cancer services that are offered.We have the most brilliant people in the world with regard to dealing with cancer. While I am speaking, I will acknowledge and send solidarity from this House to all of the people who are undergoing treatment for cancer at present. We are lucky enough to have good outcomes in many areas. We need to talk about regional outcomes on another occasion but we have expertise here that is second to none. We are lucky to have it but we have to get this legislation right because patients deserve to have and are entitled to their own information. The Minister has a responsibility and we have a responsibility. We have an opportunity this evening and, even if it takes a couple of extra weeks, we have a responsibility to get this right. It can permeate across the whole system and instead of having a situation in which we are protecting the system, we can put the patient front and centre once and for all. This has gone on for too long. I spoke to the Minister earlier about the valproate situation. I ask the Minister to bring it to the last Cabinet meeting next week to resolve the issues or, at least, to have an openness and transparency in how we deal with them.

I will try to address them quickly. With regard to the process, yes, we can go back to the Dáil. Normal process would be for the Bill to go the Seanad after Report Stage where it would be amended and come back here anyway. However, colleagues are keen for the debate and the changes to be made here. My understanding of procedure, on which I am open to being corrected, is that we will adjourn at approximately 9.20 p.m. We can adjourn at that time until January, which gives time to craft and table the amendments. I will ask my departmental officials to engage with colleagues through that time in order that we understand what amendments are being brought forward. We are all talking about January for the right reasons but to be clear, there are only six sitting days in January. We do not want this to go on and on. We all want this done as quickly as possible but let us all be clear. I think we are back on 18 January and there are six sitting days. We will prioritise the Bill, obviously. The second issue is one Deputies Kelly and Shortall had asked me to raise and I had not yet had the opportunity to do so. Deputy Kelly referenced it again. The issue is with regard to the rest of the Bill, rather than Part 5, but I committed to put on the record the patient safety incidences referenced in the Schedule, which make up a very small list of a very serious number of incidences. I was asked would I, as Minister for Health, add to that list. The intention is for those to be the ones no Minister could ever take out. The legal advice we have is that in order to make it as easy as possible for patients, the more specific those incidences are either in the Act or regulations, the better. It is in the interest of patients. Those are the incidences no Minister could ever take out without amending the Act. I absolutely commit we will add more to the list. Colleagues will be aware the relevant section in the Bill provides for a very broad range of incidences with regard to the parameters which could be covered. A question was asked about patients who wish to avail of the patient requested review going back to 2018. That will be available for them which is important. Finally, to go back to the issue of substance, while I acknowledge and respect all views, there is no perfect answer to this but let us put aside the audit for a minute. What is being proposed is an obligation in every diagnosis of cancer among men and women, where the screening services are involved, for the man or woman to be told a patient-requested review is available. If the patient chooses, there would be a mandatory obligation to disclose the results. Colleagues have said they would wish to know and men and women may wish to know. Leaving the audit aside entirely, the mechanism proposed will make sure every single patient is given the choice. As colleagues have said here, they would wish to know. I think I probably would too. However, the UK evidence suggests many patients do not. Every patient would have the opportunity to find out. The flipside of that if a patient says "No" - as we are told approximately half of patients in the UK say - the audit was non-anonymised and a discordance was found, the patient has clearly said he or she does not wish to know. There would now be an obligation to tell the patient even though the patient had said he or she did not wish to know. We need to reflect on that. We will work with officials to find wording and with colleagues across the House to find an amendment that reflects an obligation to inform of the right to a review.

We have an agreement on how an amendment might look. There is disagreement on the anonymised system. We will continue to have discussions on that. We have not reached agreement and we still hold hope there will be movement. However, it would be better were the Minister to adjourn it now, if that is within the rules.

It is really important legislation that will allow us to implement two final elements of the work-life balance directive from the European Union. It addresses leave for medical care purposes and the ability to seek flexible working arrangements for families and carers. We are also using this Bill to introduce the right to request remote working for all workers and two other significant elements, which are the increase of the length of time in which a woman returning to work after giving birth can take breastfeeding breaks from the current six months after birth up to two years, and the introduction of five days of paid domestic violence leave. That is a significant provision. We will be one of the first countries in the European Union to have paid leave for victims of domestic violence. Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are grouped. All of these amendments are technical. Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, amend the Long Title of the Bill to include a reference to the new entitlement under the Bill introduced on Committee Stage to domestic violence leave and to the right to request remote working.

I had to dip out of the debate earlier. I made points which were raised by the Carers' Association. I reiterate those to the Minister. Even if he cannot address those today, I ask him to bear them in mind for the next stage or for a response about them at some point if they cannot be included.
#RodericOGorman	unknown-#RodericOGorman-party	unknown-#RodericOGorman-dob	unknown-#RodericOGorman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-07 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	322	I touched base with officials about that. Regarding who is entitled to leave for medical care purposes, section 5 of the Bill inserts a new section 13A into the Parental Leave Act to provide for an entitlement to five days of medical care leave for parents and carers. An employee can take the leave to care for a person of whom the employee is the relevant parent, the spouse or civil partner of the employee, the cohabitant of the employee, a parent or grandparent of the employee, a brother or sister of the employee, or a person other than one specified who resides in the same household as the employee and is in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason. That list of entitlements is in line with Article 6 of the work-life balance directive and the definitions provided for in Article 3. This type of leave is short-term. It is different to carer's leave, which is a much longer-term commitment. This leave is short-term, at five days. It provides a degree of flexibility and allows non-familial people living in the same household to avail of the leave. I am not sure if that fully addresses the Deputy's earlier points but it outlines what has been provided.

I am also amending the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 to enable Tusla or the AAI to undertake a trace or verification in situations where the person applying cannot provide supporting evidence a parent named on a birth certificate is deceased. On amendment No. 32, the board of the AAI consists of seven members, including the chair, deputy chair and two members with social work experience. The quorum of the board is provided for in section 106 of the Adoption Act 2010. Current legislative requirements mean that a quorum consists of the chair or deputy chair and two ordinary members, one of whom must be one of the two social workers on the board. The way the Adoption Act 2010 is written, when the chair is in attendance, the deputy chair does not count towards the two ordinary members required. In addition, the existing quorum requirement puts a considerable burden on the two ordinary members of the board with social work experience. The AAI has advised that the quorum requirement set out in the Act is onerous, especially in the context of an increasing number of board meetings and an increasing requirement for board meetings at very short notice. The authority has advised of a serious risk to the effect that the specific constraints set out in the Act mean the board will not be able to meet and, therefore, that adoption orders will not be made. This is a particular issue because of the growing number of children aged 17 years being adopted from long-term foster care and board meetings being required at short notice. The proposed amendment to the Act will provide that the quorum for a meeting of the board will be the chair or deputy chair and two other members, one of whom may be the deputy chair in circumstances where the chair is presiding. This proposal offers greater flexibility in the board members who may form a quorum along with the chair by allowing the deputy chair to be recognised as one of those members and removing the requirement one of the two board members must have social work experience. Amendment No. 35 relates to the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022, which became law earlier this year. The Act provides for the release of identity information to a person who was adopted, nursed out or boarded out, who was subject to an illegal birth registration or who resided in a mother and baby home or county home institution as a child, known as a relevant person. Equally importantly, it provides for the release of information to a relative of a relevant person in the scenario where that individual is deceased. The Act provides for the release of information to their child, and thereby ensures identity information relevant to their children is available to them. It also provides for the release of information to the next of kin of persons who died as a child in a mother and baby or county home institution. In order to provide for the release of this information, the Act requires the parent named on the birth certificate also be deceased. This amendment will enable Tusla or the AAI to undertake a trace for verification in situations where the person applying cannot provide supporting evidence to that effect. It will support the primary purposed of the Act, namely, to ensure the release of information in all cases where it is available. Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment to add references to these amendments to the Long Title of the Bill.

There are a number of errors in respect of this amendment but I understand that they do not materially affect it. There are some errors in the cross-references included in the numbered list circulated yesterday and dated 6 December. On amendment No. 6, within the proposed section 1(3) and 1(5), both cross-references to section 22 should read section 20. The reference to section 23 should read section 21.

Part 1 will deal with commencement provisions. Part 2 will deal with the leave provisions of the Bill, including leave for medical care purposes and domestic violence leave, the right to request flexible working and other amendments to the parental leave Act. Part 3 will deal with the right to request remote working. Part 4 will deal with provisions relating to the code of practice and amendments to other pieces of legislation, including the miscellaneous provisions. Amendment No. 6 inserts a new section 1 into the Bill to provide for the commencement provisions of the parts of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 7 and 36 are consequential on this amendment.

Employers will be required to have regard to the code when considering both flexible working and remote working requests. The code of practice will be developed by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. It is intended the code of practice will provide practical guidance to employers and employees throughout this process and the code will be developed in consultation with unions and employers. I am aware a code of practice-type approach was one that was heavily recommended in the pre-legislative process for the right to request remote work Bill. That process is now going to be used for both requests for remote working and requests for flexible working.

I have asked the Minister, probably six times at this stage, if he can please explain how this is going to operate in practice in the civil and public service. As he is well aware, workers in the higher education sector will be entitled to ten days of leave.Ten days is the international norm. It is what has been negotiated by trade unions. Ten days is what Women's Aid says is necessary but it is also what is now available in the higher education sector. It is not that long since the unions were in the Labour Court, where they were told in no uncertain terms that there had to be standardisation in leave arrangements. This goes against that. I am struggling to understand why the entitlement has been halved. It was given by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris but it has now been halved as part of this Bill. I know the difference between a statutory entitlement and a non-statutory one so I ask the Minister not to explain that to me. Ten days is what Women's Aid and all the advocacy groups have asked for. Ten days is what is accepted as the norm.

What we are introducing is a statutory minimum provision that will apply to all workers across all sectors. Obviously, in many sectors in both the public and private sphere, employers provide more than a statutory minimum, whether that is with regard to leave, pay or a variety of issues. What we are providing for here is a statutory minimum across all sectors. It is the first time we will have this in this State. We will be one of the first countries in the EU to have this paid leave. That is important. The Deputy makes the comparison with international best practice but it is important to remember that very few countries have actually taken the step we are taking in providing paid domestic violence leave. Some countries have more but some have more unpaid domestic violence leave. I think the Deputy and I, and everyone in this House, are in agreement on the necessity of this being a paid provision. That is what we are introducing. Of course, we will also have a review after two years to look at how it is being implemented. One of the things that I have no doubt will be considered at that stage is whether there is a need to increase the number of days. This is an important first step in the provision of paid leave and is one that has been welcomed by unions, DSGBV groups and the NGOs that work in this sector.

The employer must give four weeks' notice to the employee and set out the reasons the flexible working arrangement is being terminated. In providing such notice to the employee, the employer must have regard to the employee's needs as well as their own. An employee may also make representations to the employer upon receipt of such a notice. This provision has been included to provide a balance between the needs of the employee and the employer, which may change over time. The four-week period is intended to give the employee time to make other arrangements. The existing section 13D, which provided for the employer to postpone the commencement of a period of flexible working until the signing of an agreement, has been removed to avoid an employee being delayed in taking up flexible working arrangements beyond the period in which it is required. Section 13E, which provides for the variance of flexible working arrangements, will now become section 13D. Amendment No. 15 is a consequential technical change to the Bill as a result of amendment No. 20.

13E.

(6) Where a flexible working arrangement is terminated under subsection (1), the agreement referred to in section 13C(1)(b)(i) shall be deemed to be revoked accordingly.”.

Section 13G sets out the procedures for when an employee is seeking to return early to their original working pattern. The new section 13G allows for an employer to propose an alternative date of return to the employee. This is to allow an employer additional time to put arrangements in place for an employee to return to their original working pattern.

This review will allow for an opportunity to review the operation of the new entitlements under this Part. It is also intended to consider whether the right to request flexible working under this Part be extended to all employees.

Flexibility is being given to an employer to make arrangements for a worker coming back so there is more time allowed there. There is mention in this of the WRC and the Labour Court. Is it the intention that the move to which the worker is objecting will take place, obviously under protest, and then the matter will be referred to the Labour Court? I am conscious that the time it takes to get from the decision to refer something to actually sitting in the Labour Court could be up to six or eight months. I am just wondering what is intended to happen in the meantime. Would people have to move under protest? How is that going to work?

Review of Part
27. The Minister shall, not earlier than one year and not later than 2 years after the commencement of this section, after consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Commission, persons whom he or she considers to be representative of employers generally and persons whom he or she considers to be representative of employees generally, conduct a review of the operation of this Part and shall prepare a report in writing of the findings of the review and shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.”.As I indicated on Committee Stage, amendment No. 30 is intended to introduce a right to request remote working for all employees. The right to request flexible working remains limited to parents and carers. This means that all requests for remote and flexible working will considered under one piece of integrated legislation simplifying the process for employers and employees, and reducing the administrative burden on employers. The application and decision process for both have also been harmonised insofar as possible. These amendments set out a framework for making a remote working request and employers are obliged to consider and respond to that request. The general scheme of the Right to Request Remote Work Bill provided 13 grounds for refusal as well as a general right to refuse on business grounds. Under these amendments, the enumerated grounds for refusal have been removed entirely and replaced with a requirement for employers to have regard to their needs and employee needs when considering requests for remote working. Employers will also be required to have regard to the code of practice which is to be established on a statutory footing and will provide practical guidance on how remote and flexible working requests should be treated. A complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, following a refusal is possible where an employer has not complied with the requirements of the Bill in considering the code of practice. This represents an enhanced right to complain when compared with the original Right to Request Remote Work Bill. The remote working Bill also included a statutory requirement for an employer to have a remote working policy. This requirement will not be included in the integrated Bill. Guidance to employers on remote working policy will instead be provided for in the code of practice. Under the stand-alone Right to Request Remote Work Bill, it was a criminal offence not to have a remote working policy, this has not been included in these amendments. The service requirement in the stand-alone Bill before a request could be made was six months. Under the integrated Bill, it will be six months before remote working can commence. In effect, employees may commence remote working up to 12 weeks earlier than provided for under the original Bill. These amendments also introduce new provisions originating from the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to remote working requests that were not a feature of the original Right to Request Remote Work Bill. The most substantial of these are anti-abuse provisions which permits an employer to end the flexible working arrangement where the employee is not fulfilling their agreed duties. The amendments also include a provision which permits and employer to terminate the flexible or remote working arrangements where it would have, or is having, a substantial adverse effect on the operation of his or her business.

If a worker is not carrying out their full duties, believe me, there are plenty of polices, procedures and everything else that can ensure they do. I do not see the need to put that into this legislation, to be frank. The reason we are here discussing this is that despite having nearly two and a half years to deliver what he said he was going to deliver, the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, failed to do so. Now we have a situation where the Government is trying to circumvent its own failure by allowing the Tánaiste to effectively affix or annex his remote working legislation onto this legislation. The result is that complex legislation which should be delivered by way of a stand-alone Bill is being introduced by way of an amendment bypassing key legislative Stages in the Oireachtas. By introducing the legislation as an amendment on the Final Stage of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, the Government is bypassing three key Stage that a stand-alone Bill would have gone through in the Dáil, namely, Second, Committee and Report Stages. The Government and the Tánaiste are attempting to pull a fast one in relation to remote working. They are denying elected representatives an opportunity to query or raise concerns regarding these complex legislative changes around remote working. There are a number of questions regarding the recently published amendments which need to be answered and I will put them to the Minister now. Section 18(2) states that a worker approved for remote working arrangements will not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed six months work. I do not know where the six months came from. As I said to the Minister before, he should at least be trying to do as well, if not better, than the Tories over the water. We know they have said it is a no-brainer that employees can start work as remote working. Plenty of people start remote working from day one. This is the form of working; they start from day one and work remotely. The following question arises in terms of the six months. Does it interfere with the ability of a worker and their employer to agree remote working, for example, in the event where they agree remote working? It is a growing thing that many people will start work as a remote worker and may never have an office-based job but where they do have an agreed remote working arrangement, if it is agreed before the six months has passed, are they entitled to the protections under this Act? Are they entitled to the protection of the WRC and the other machinery of the State and if so, how will that work?  In section 18(3)(c)(i) provides that a worker must state the reason they are seeking remote working arrangements and it is "referred to as the employees needs". This is massively disrespectful, that is, the idea that you would have to go in and talk about your own personal circumstances. I mean you have to be able to demonstrate that you can work remotely and that is fine. You have to do your work and, as I said to the Minister, there are plenty of policies and procedures there to ensure a worker turns up and does their work. There are also plenty of punishments, by the way, and the Minister does not need to add anything extra. I think this is a bit paternalistic. Take Betty, for example, who has three kids and looks after her elderly mother. She can go to her boss and tell them she has three kids at home, an elderly ma and all of that kind of stuff going on. She could tell them that life is hard and, therefore, she would like to request some of this remote working. Then you could have Peter who may be a single man and who cannot demonstrate a need, or does not want to actually go in and discuss that aspect of his personal life with his boss. I genuinely fail to see why we are coming at it from this perspective. It is 20 odd years since the first time I had a negotiation with an employer on remote working, teleworking or e-working as we used to call it. That is a long time ago and at that time it was thought of as a bit of a treat or a grace in favour arrangement where you could have a bit of the flexible working and it was reserved for certain staff members. This should represent something new, different and better. With regard to section 18(3)(c)(ii) and the need for a worker to provide "details of the proposed remote working location", I fail to see why this is there as well. As long as they are in the State, it really is not anybody's business as long as they are doing their work. Again, all of this is predicated on the worker being able to deliver the work they are contractually obliged to do. If they can do that, I do not see what business it is of the employer where it is that they are working.  Regarding section 20, I ask the Minister what constitutes a "substantial adverse effect" on the operations of a business. I ask this because subsection (d) states an employee's flexible working arrangement can be terminated for a substantial adverse effect which reads to me like it could be terminated for any reason.  On section 23(2), I ask what constitutes "reasonable grounds" for believing an employee is abusing remote working. I gave the example earlier of a person working at home or working remotely in a hub or wherever. If they are spotted by HR on a half day in SuperValu picking up some shopping, are they going to be subject to some kind of disciplinary procedures? If they are hitting all their key performance indicators, KPIs, and their targets and doing their work, what checks and balances are going to be put in place here? Section 25(5) provides for 20 weeks remuneration as compensation. This could be pushed out to 26 weeks to make it six months' pay. On section 25(6), I ask why there are so many exclusions as to what an adjudication officer or Labour Court can consider in terms of the conduct and the decisions of the employer to reject or terminate an employee's flexible working arrangement. I say that in light of the discussions that were had. The reason the Tánaiste's appallingly anti-worker legislation had to be effectively binned was that there were multiple lists of reasons an employer could refuse.

There are some really good positives in the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 and it is welcome. As I mentioned, there are many groups such as Family Carer's Ireland which are really happy to see this come forward.This particular section being inserted into it is unfair to the Bill, for want of better words, but also as there are many queries raised by Deputy O'Reilly, we should have the normal time to tease them out through pre-legislative scrutiny, Committee Stage and all other stages. It needs to be separate legislation. That is not what is going to happen now obviously but I want to make the point that I see where Deputy O'Reilly is coming from in this regard and how we should have the opportunity to interrogate this separately. It takes away from all the good things and the long-overdue aspects in the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill around leave for parents with sick children etc for which many people have been waiting a long time. There are genuine questions in regard to that. I do not know whether we will get sufficient answers to them this evening. Is this part of it going to be reviewed? Will it be reviewed separately? There was mention earlier of a two-year review. Will that be built into it? Has the Minister comments on that?

It certainly says everything about not having a good work life balance. I pick up on the point that Deputy Funchion made. There is good reason to have five stages to legislation. It means it has been thought out and teased out, that the principle of it has been talked about, that amendments have been tabled and considered on Committee Stage and reported back to the Dáil. There is then a further debate on it and if something needs to be amended at Report Stage it is possible to do it. There is a purpose in doing that, which is to ensure we have good, solid, robust legislation that is future-proofed. A massive opportunity is being missed here. Essentially what has happened is the Tánaiste’s legislation has been binned. It was awful legislation. I would have looked for it to be withdrawn and recrafted anyway. However, we are going to miss an opportunity in doing that because there was the possibility of doing something very constructive. I do not understand what the mindset is that would consider this six-month rule, that it does not apply until six months. That is almost a negative. That should be something that is embraced in legislation that is adopting a different kind of culture of remote working as an entitlement and a benefit. As I said when I spoke earlier, one of those benefits is very much a climate benefit. It is a regional balance benefit. That is the huge lost opportunity. Will the Minister address the issue of what was the thinking in regard to the six-months provision? For the life of me I cannot think of anything other than a paternalistic approach, as Deputy O’Reilly said, that it is assumed that people must be kept an eye on for six months to see if they are working out and then maybe let them work remotely. It is that supervisory, old-fashioned way of doing things. When you look at the analysis done during Covid-19 on people who worked remotely in actual fact it was the reverse of what you might think. Productivity went up, not down. People worked longer than the set hours. This notion that people must be stood over to make sure they are good employees is not the kind of culture we should be trying to adopt in a good work life balance or in terms of crafting legislation creating an environment for working remotely.

I spoke about remote working. It is part of our future so we need to have the balance right. I also asked about the two-year review. It is important to clarify that because while I raised the issue on Committee Stage that it is vitally important that business owners are brought along on this journey with legislation, it is hugely important that an employee who needs the time can access that time but that the business owner is not also losing out because that would not be good for the working relationship. I welcome the fact there is an obligation on employers to facilitate this. Work life balance brings the most benefits when the options are available which suit the organisation's needs and those of the employees. I say this because while this work life balance is really important we are here at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday night. I know our time has been extended. An extra few hours were put on today but we need to lead by example. It is important that we get this legislation through but it is also important that we ourselves are examples of how we go forward. We have had many committee meetings on this. I welcome that. I want to ask the Minister about the two-year review. What exactly will happen within the two years? What is the plan to go forward? Will the Minister come back to us with that information?

Deputies spoke about the process both in terms of the work we have done through committee on the original Work Life Balance directive and of course the work that was done through the Right to Request Remote Work Bill. I am aware that a very detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, process was undertaken and the detailed PLS report was published. In regard to the amendments being brought forward today, we are implementing the recommendations of the PLS report. I struggle to think how often I have seen such a clear implementation of a PLS report in legislation. In recommendation 5 the committee recommended that codes of good practice quickly evolve so that once in place refusals must be grounded in a stated policy from employers founded on these codes. Recommendation 6 states that the committee proposes the principles underpinning a reasonable code of practice should now be set out in law and allow the WRC to design how this should be applied in different workplace situations. We are doing both of those with this legislation. The committee advised that to accompany the primary legislation with the WRC, and we are using the WRC code of practice to elaborate on and encourage reasonableness on the part of employer and employee. We are doing that. In recommendation 8 the committee proposed legislation should mandate the WRC to draw up a code of practice in the first instance upon which the policies of employers can be based. We are doing that. Finally, the committee proposed that the legislation should align with the general scheme of the Work Life Balance Miscellaneous Provisions Bill. We are doing that. We are implementing the recommendations brought forward from PLS on remote working and implementing it. Deputy Funchion and I have had discussions on how much PLS has gone into legislation. I think a great deal of the PLS has gone into this legislation. It is worth setting that out at the start. There will be a two-year review of this legislation. That is important. We are doing a number of new an innovative things here. The area of remote working is an innovative one. As Deputy O’Reilly said some companies now offer it from day one and that is a positive thing. We are putting in place a statutory right to request it. There will be a review after two years. As we know that review will also look at potentially expanding the right of flexible working, which is the right for varied hours or a shorter working day which currently, as implementing the EU directive only applies to parents and carers, it will examine expanding that further as well. That could be a potential further advancement of workers' rights generally and of course it will look at the provisions of the five days. It will look at the update of DSGBV leave and see what changes need to be made there. I wanted to make those general points. In regard to the six months within which the right to request gets its statutory basis, that allows an assessment in terms of the needs of the work of the employer and of the employee. It may not automatically be available in every workplace from day one for a full understanding of whether a request for remote working meets the needs of the employer and the employee.It is also important to remember that the right can be granted after six months but that does not stop an employee applying for it earlier. As we know, there is an application process of a number of weeks in which their application is judged. That can happen before the six-month period but the actual ability to take up the right kicks in after that six-month period. As I said, remote working is about balancing the employer's rights and the rights of the employee. On that point, it is worth drawing a comparison. Deputy O'Reilly referred to the UK legislation and she argues part of the approach adopted there is better than the approach being adopted here. It is worth contrasting the UK proposals with our own. Our own proposals contain no statutory grounds for refusal, and that was in the original proposal on remote working, with the 13 reasons. Now, we have no statutory grounds for refusal, unlike the UK legislation, which has eight statutory grounds of refusal. The Irish legislation contains an explicit legal obligation for employers to consider the employee's needs. That is part of the balancing test under the Irish law but that is not the case in the UK legislation. Also, the Irish law contains no limits on the number of requests that can be made whereas, under the UK legislation, that is limited to one request per year. In terms of the overall strength of our legislation, it stacks up well vis-à-vis what is being proposed in the United Kingdom. I will deal with some of the other specific points. On the definitions Deputy O'Reilly spoke about, “substantial adverse effect” and “reasonable grounds”, both of those will be fleshed out within the code of conduct which we discussed and which will be brought forward by the Workplace Relations Commission. In terms of the ask on the location, some remote working requests will probably be granted in terms of also having reasonable access to the office if the employee is needed to attend in the office or in the workplace at some point. In that context, it is reasonable for the employer to understand where the employee is based and will be proposing to undertake the work. Regarding the exclusions, this has to be understood in the context of what this is. This is a right to request. It is not a statutory right to remote working, and we recognise that. It is a right to request and, as we know, not all occupations, not all industries and not all particular roles within an enterprise will be suitable or appropriate for remote working. As such, there has to be some element of an exclusion provision. Again, that is something that can be looked at in that two-year review we spoke about earlier.

The PLS was conducted on an entirely different piece of legislation, one which, as we have already discussed, was inherently flawed, exactly as we might expect from this Government. I asked the Minister a specific question in regard to the protections that apply. I take it from his answer that if someone agrees a remote working arrangement with their employer, those protections cannot kick in for six months even if they agree it on week one. I would be delighted to be wrong on that but my understanding of what the Minister has said is that if someone agrees it in the first week, or starts from the first week, on a remote working-type arrangement, the protections the Minister has outlined do not kick in until six months are up. Is that right?

Protection should be there for people who are remote working. Again, it is that paternalistic, grace and favour arrangement and attitude. The Minister referenced the importance of an employer knowing the worker can access the office. As it stands, an employer does not need to know where a person lives. All they need to know is that the worker turns up. If the requirement is to be in the office on a Wednesday, they need to be in the office on a Wednesday. If they have to get up a couple of hours early or stay overnight in their mother’s because she happens to live close to the office, it is not really their bosses’ business. I am a little disturbed that the Minister thinks it is. This is a new form of working. It is one which many people benefited from during the pandemic. It cuts down on people commuting and it improves their work-life balance, which is what we are talking about. If it is not someone's boss's business now where someone lives, and it is not, then I do not see how it can suddenly become his or her business just because they happen to apply for remote working. Again, it is that attitude of a grace and favour arrangement or it being almost like a treat. I have done enough legislation in this place to know that when the answer to every second question is either “code of conduct” or “review”, it is a red flag that the legislation is being rushed and is not being done correctly. I would love to be proven wrong but that is my worry. It is regrettable that someone could come to a voluntary arrangement with their employer and find themselves outside of the protections, limited as they are.

PLS was also undertaken in terms of the work life balance Bill. The core recommendation from that PLS process was the use of that code of conduct. That is central. There are 20 recommendations and six of them referred to the importance of the code of conduct, and they also referred very clearly to the unacceptability of legislative reasons for refusal. Having taken the guidance of the PLS to do that piece of work, particularly in terms of the determination, and to let that be done in a code of conduct drawn up by the Workplace Relations Commission, it is strange to then criticise our use of the code of conduct in terms of elements that will be decided there. We are following what I think was good advice from the Oireachtas joint committee in terms of the use of the code of conduct. This Bill and the use of the right to request remote working is going to be significantly strengthened as a result of the strong recommendations that came from the PLS process. Contrary to what Deputies are arguing, it is an example of the Government listening to Deputies, listening to the opinions that came from that PLS report and legislating for stronger legislation and a stronger ultimate right for workers to avail of that.

The PLS was on an entirely different piece of legislation. That is the point I was making. If it was any way unclear, I apologise, but I thought it was a fairly simple and straightforward point. The PLS and the report that arose from it was on a completely different piece of legislation. I am not disputing that PLS took place in regard to the work life balance Bill but there was no PLS on this section. I understand the Minister took on board some of what was in the recommendations. However, there was no PLS conducted on this Bill, which is essentially, or should be, in my opinion, a stand-alone piece of legislation, and it is not. What is effectively a Bill on its own has now been wedged into another Bill. That is fine. That is the Government's prerogative, it has the votes and that is grand, but it is being wedged into another Bill. To say that PLS has been done on it is not correct. PLS was done on an entirely different piece of legislation. It was done on the work life balance Bill without what is effectively another Bill being put into it. That is the point I was making. It is a relatively straightforward point but it would be erroneous for anyone listening to this to think that PLS had been conducted on that section of this Bill. Some of the PLS which was conducted on another piece of legislation has been incorporated into this, and I do not dispute that, but there was no PLS done on that section of the Bill. It was done on the work life balance Bill without that section in it. It was done on an entirely different piece of legislation by another committee in regard to the right to request remote working.
