#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Leader is proposing that the House deal with No. 3, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 which was published and circulated to colleagues in the House this morning. The Government is attempting to ram it through the House today and tomorrow. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had 12 months to get his act together on this issue and now in the late stages of this parliamentary session he and his Government colleagues are attempting to bring the Bill before this and the other House within a matter of two weeks. This is unacceptable. The Minister has used the argument that this is a complicated matter which needs to be thought out and considered, yet the Leader is proposing that the House deal with Committee and Report Stages in a period of three hours, even though the Bill contains a significant number of sections. This is a radical departure from existing practice. We need more time to debate the Bill, which should not be dealt with in this manner this week. I have no difficulty dealing with Second Stage today but tomorrow's Committee Stage debate should continue next week.Justice spokespersons on this side of the House will be in the House from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. They will deal with the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. It is not fair that they should be in the House for that length of time and not get the chance to consider their amendments to the Bill published this morning. The Leader is, presumably, under pressure from the Government to get this Bill through the House. However, this is not the way to do business. We do not normally have Committee and Report Stages together. I ask her to seriously reconsider this in advance of tomorrow's sitting.When is it proposed to have full statements on the health strategy, now nothing more than an election strategy and proven as such? When will the Minister for Health and Children inform the House of the allegedly fundamental changes he will make to the health service? The key issues concern improving the service for our people, delivering on the Government's commitments for an additional 3,000 beds, 200,000 extra medical cards and the elimination of waiting lists within two years. These are all pipe dreams. We want to debate the real health strategy issues, not some cosmetic changes which will not make a difference to people's health. I ask for a debate on this issue.The enthusiasm, goodwill and generosity of the people have been shown once again in their response to the wonderful athletes coming from all over the world to celebrate and be part of the Special Olympics. I hope I speak for all colleagues on this issue. I have been struck by the marvellous enthusiasm of people who have opened their homes, hearts and wallets in order that we may host these games. This is a great example of the good-natured spirit of our people and should be celebrated. The country should take pride in their generosity over the last week in particular. We have seen many people come for this great occasion which we should all celebrate.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I support Senator Brian Hayes in his comments on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. The Leader must agree that it is not the most helpful way to proceed, and it does not assist the efficiency of the House if we get a Bill in the morning and have to debate it in the afternoon. The timescale is unrealistically short.We have debated the level of crime in the capital city but we need a focused debate on gangland warfare in the city. The situation is getting completely out of hand and many people would like to see clear, specific, targeted action against the operation of gangs. In the last couple of days we had another assassination – the drive-by shooting of a man in Eden Quay. That is the tenth gangland murder so far this year. When will we have a concerted effort to stop the warfare? The apparent growth in the level of violence in the State is regrettable.I initiated the process of putting down amendments which would protect the gay community and Travellers against discrimination. As somebody with that track record I say that it is time the decent people within the Traveller community spoke to and dealt with some of the worst elements in that community. It is intolerable that the day before yesterday a pub in Mayo, the proprietors of which are an elderly couple, was ransacked because a group of Travellers was refused drink after hours. The landlord and his wife complied with the law and the group trashed the pub. The guards said the situation was horrible because of the large number of people involved. That is not acceptable. The message should go out from those who have traditionally supported Travellers that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable.In the light of what Senator Brian Hayes said about the generally marvellous feeling there is towards the athletes in the Special Olympics, it is also unacceptable that a group of Travellers in Ennis should occupy land which was to be used as a welcome site for people participating in the Special Olympics. It was one of the meanest things I had seen in a long time because the people of Ennis had gone to a great deal of trouble preparing a celebration. They had planned a brass band and all kinds of things which the participants would have loved. However, the people concerned, in a mean spirit, moved in and spoiled years of preparation.I say this sadly as one who has consistently supported Travellers' rights. However, they need to talk to rogue elements within their community and tell them they are giving all Travellers a bad name and to stop such behaviour. They should also tell them that they will support the Garda from within the community against this behaviour, which is intolerable to any citizen, whether he or she is a member of the settled or Traveller communities. We are not prepared to put up with such behaviour.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I support my colleagues in their measured objections to the principle of a Bill being published between 9 a.m and 9.30 a.m. this morning when it appeared in our post. It is stated on page 3 that the Bill contains references to around 14 other pieces of legislation. No amount of preliminary leaks, warnings or drafts could prepare an Opposition spokesperson without the availability of a Bill. It is profoundly wrong. I recall the last time the Leader was under pressure from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have the Immigration Bill through this House in a hurry. It is funny because that Bill is still on the Dáil Order Paper, despite our having been told at one stage that it was so urgent it had to pass through both Houses in a week. The truth is that there would be no rush about this Bill if the Houses were not adjourning so early. Presumably, this is because the Taoiseach is fed up of losing the debate to the Leaders of the Opposition two mornings a week and wants to hide from his responsibilities.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am finished on that topic but wish to record my view that it is entirely unacceptable.Does the Leader have any plans for us to debate the Government's restructuring of the health service, which the newspapers are calling "reform"? There used to be a phrase – democratic centralism – used by people with whom I would be more acquainted than others. It is now part of history but we have a notion of bureaucratic centralism masquerading as increased efficiency. There is a need for a serious debate on these proposals. I am not a believer in management speak which seems to suggest less democracy means more efficiency. However, the logic of that argument could land us in dangerous territory. Democracy is the way in which consumers of the health service make their feelings known. That is an issue for the debate. I ask the Leader to consider a serious debate on the health service.The story from County Mayo has become a convenient way of distorting an issue. I do not care whether someone is a Traveller, it is wrong for any section of the community to break the law. As it happens, the 11 camper vans in question are all British registered and were passing through County Mayo. I do not understand the reason gardaí came, observed the demeanour of the people concerned and then left the scene. Subsequently, the son of the publican involved made three 999 calls without getting an answer. That is a bigger issue than that of the Travellers. Judging by his demeanour on a radio programme, this decent, dignified man effectively felt abandoned by the part of the State which is supposed to protect us in such circumstances.There was another issue raised last night. Although I do not wish to get involved with the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the little girl in Tallaght, at the tail end of the report, almost as a passing casual remark, it was mentioned that the girl and her family had been intimidated out of the house in which they were living by the family of the person now not being charged with any offence. Does the State offer protection to its citizens when there is a real and immediate threat to them? I understand gardaí cannot be everywhere but the man in County Mayo sought the protection of the Garda. The other family knew who was intimidating it. Can we not protect our citizens from threats? If not, we might as well forget about it.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I thank Senator Norris for raising the incident involving Travellers in Ennis. Perhaps the Leader will arrange a debate on Travellers' rights. While I recognise the difficulties Travellers face in the Ennis region, their actions in recent days have brought difficulties to the people of Ennis who are grappling with the issue and handling it exceptionally well. I was proud of the people of Ennis and County Clare who turned out in their thousands yesterday to welcome the visiting delegations. The difficulties that arose earlier in the day were overcome by the evening. Rogue elements of the kind involved in this incident have no place and are not condoned by anybody. I agree with Senator Norris's remarks. It was an outrageous situation and an attempt to damage the reputation and the people of Ennis. Thankfully, it did not succeed.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I support the comments by Senators Brian Hayes and Ryan on the way the Order of Business is being dealt with this week, especially the proposals for dealing with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. I am the Fine Gael Party's spokesperson on this very important legislation, for which we have called on many occasions. However, the Bill is being rushed through the House and will not get the time and attention it deserves from all Senators. I ask the Leader to use her influence with the Minister to ensure it is dealt with in a proper manner. This will entail giving us the time to deal with it. Senator Tuffy and I, and other Senators, will be in the House until 6 p.m., yet we will be required to submit amendments for Committee Stage, scheduled to be taken tomorrow. It is unacceptable that we should be put under such pressure. I ask the Leader to see what can be done.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I join Senator Brian Hayes in welcoming the Special Olympics athletes. I also congratulate the organisers for holding the Games on an all-island basis. The welcome so manifest in the South is also manifest in the North, both from members of the public and the public authorities. It has been an exemplary act of community co-operation.Will the Leader ask the Minster for Transport to use his good offices to encourage the National Roads Authority to take action on the tolling of the Drogheda bypass? It is a wonderful road incorporating a beautiful bridge. Motorists from the North cannot pay the toll in sterling, which creates an additional burden for them which will be pronounced on days on which football and international rugby matches are held. The difficulty with present arrangements, which act as a deterrent, could be easily addressed.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I support Senator Terry's comments on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is complicated legislation. Perhaps there could be a bigger gap between Second and Committee Stages.We all know there is a grave shortage of acute hospital beds in this city, not least in the children's hospitals. A few months ago the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, attended a debate in the House on the fostering of children in the course of which I pointed out that, sometimes, children who required fostering were placed in acute hospital beds in the children's hospitals by the social services. While I am sure the Minister of State did not mean to misinform the House, he said this practice was being phased out.Recently, Professor Denis Gill of the Royal College of Surgeons said in a speech that acute hospital beds for children had been used on 108 occasions last year to mind children for a few days, sometimes a few weeks and, in some cases, even a few months. Not only does this mean that children are in the wrong place, it also means that other children who are ill, some of whom may need urgent treatment, are not being treated. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to return to the House to tell us what his Department and those involved in organising such care are doing?

Much has been said in this House and other fora about Travellers' rights but they have obligations also. It appears that a certain section of that community considers its rights to involve subverting the rights of others. It is interesting to note the registration numbers of the vehicles involved. We are not discussing the traditional Traveller as we know him or her but transient traders who could buy and sell every Member in this Chamber and have a great deal of cash left over. It is important to ask the reason there was a failure to respond to the three 999 calls made. I regret to say this raises a very serious question. Are vintners under the protection of the law? As somebody who has worked in bars and experienced similar but less serious incidents, I can appreciate how the couple in question felt. There are serious questions which require answers.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Taoiseach was heard to say last week that financial institutions had a moral responsibility to pass on the interest rate cut to their customers. I am sure everyone in this House agrees. However, if moral responsibility had been applied to Government decisions over the last 12 months, it would have altered the manner in which the country was run. The Minister for Health and Children has a moral responsibility to prevent people from lying on trolleys when they should be in hospital beds. He also has a moral responsibility to look after carers and provide services for those most in need.

It is something of which the Government and its spin doctors have lost sight which is the reason it is important to hold a debate. It is of the utmost importance to the general electorate.

In a week in which there is a great outpouring of tolerance in relation to the Special Olympics we have all witnessed wonderful scenes on television and in our towns. I must confess, however, that my home town of Drumshambo, host to the team from Mauritania, has not experienced them due to the team's visa problems which are devastating to the local committee.In the context of tolerance and openness, I ask the Leader to consider requesting the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to make a statement to the House about growing intolerance at international football matches. There have been a number of comments in the media following the continual booing of a Georgian player due to the fact that he plays for Glasgow Rangers. There is an element of support for the Irish football team which is introducing an air of intolerance which was never present. I suggest that Fran Rooney, the new chief executive officer of the FAI, enter discussions with the Minister on the matter. On the issue of morality which has been raised in the House, we are talking about an unrepresentative minority which equates following the Republic of Ireland football team with following Celtic Football Club. They are separate entities.Given the spirit of tolerance that is evident in the country, the House should take a position on this. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should issue a statement condemning this encroachment on what has traditionally been a family affair. People who go to international matches would not have experienced this previously.There is also a responsibility on the sports media. Members will be aware that, being a sports journalist, I have more than a passing interest in sport. The media have failed to make reference to this intolerable behaviour in their match reports. Perhaps the Leader would consider inviting the Minister to the House to make a statement on this issue.

Reservations have been expressed by Members about the short time available to Members to acquaint themselves with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill and to conduct the necessary research. It is not appropriate for the Minister to publish a Bill in the morning and expect spokespersons to stay in the House all day to debate it. Ascot is on at present but I do not expect the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to go there like his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, goes to Cheltenham.

Five years ago County Roscommon had four ESB shops, but now not one is left open. Does the ESB wish to continue serving the entire population of the country or just the major population centres? The Taoiseach intervened with the lending institutions with regard to the cost of borrowing. He should now intervene with the ESB, which applies an APR of 22.9%. That is exorbitant and is causing severe hardship.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House when negotiations are completed in Luxembourg on CAP reform? Commissioner Fischler has put forward proposals for regional solutions and greater flexibility at national level. He has nothing more than the renationalisation of the CAP in mind. The consequences for Irish agriculture and farming communities is that the existing decline will accelerate and the current supports of €460 million will be removed by 2006. The Seanad should have an urgent debate on this issue to ensure the Minister is aware of our support and, in the absence of a national plan for agriculture, to suggest to the Minister the need for a strategy to retain as many family farms as possible. It is important that the Leader invite the Minister to the House to debate this issue and that the Minister prevent the renationalisation of the CAP in Europe.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Leader of Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, said with regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill that too short a period has been given to engage in a full examination of its intricacies. I will come back to that later. Senators are entitled to the very best of service and information from all sides. I would add, though not by way of self-justification, that we did circulate, not an early draft but sketches of what the Bill was about, to party leaders and spokespersons some day last week – Thursday, I think. Thus, the Bill was not a bolt from the blue, so to speak. I have just checked and I understand the leaders and spokespersons on justice of each party received some material through my office.My colleague, Senator Dardis, has noted that on 11 June, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform discussed the general scheme of the Bill with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The content of the Bill has been adapted – particularly sections 17 and 21(1)(b) – to take account of a number of concerns raised by members of the joint committee. I point that out not in self-justification but simply to indicate that the Bill is not quite a bolt from the blue. I am not sure which Members of this House sit on the joint committee but I am sure some do.I will inquire if it is possible to take Committee Stage on Friday or next Monday, but I will have to come back to the House on the matter after I have made those inquiries. I accept that to take Committee Stage the day after the Second Stage debate is a very rapid progression, to put it mildly, so I will see if it would suit the Minister to take Committee Stage on Friday or Monday of next week.Senators asked that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, should come to the House to discuss the health strategy. The Minister fully intends to come to this House before we dissolve—
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Dissolve? Does the Leader know something we do not?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	38	No, not dissolve – I mean before the summer break. I discussed this personally with the Minister yesterday, and he intends to come to the House. I do not know what date it will be because he is not going to the Dáil with his proposals until Friday week, but we will have the Minister here before we break up.The Special Olympics is just wonderful. Every time one reads about it, sees it on television or encounters it in one's home town or area, the athletes are like shining beacons of light. When one sees their faces, their helpers, their families and what they are doing, it raises morale and spirits, and it is such an inspiration to all of us to see such wholehearted participation and joy. We all had that sense of anticipation and participation, I suppose, when we were younger, but to see it now amongst these athletes is inspiring. We have all been ennobled by their nobility. Noble is very much what they are, and I thank Senator Hayes for raising the matter because it deserves proper acclamation.Senator Norris agrees with Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003, and he also raised the issue of gangland murders. The Senator has been very prominent indeed in raising the issues of the Traveller community in a very positive way. That is why the Senator, and the rest of us, have been struck by the carry on in Mayo. I do not know the details of the issue so I would not comment on the unanswered 999 calls, but the Senator properly draws attention to the whole issue.Senator Brendan Ryan objects to the celerity of the proposed passage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and he also wishes to have a debate on health reform. We will certainly have such a debate. The Senator rightly argues that citizens are entitled to have their rights protected, but sometimes when one reads stories about calls not being answered and so on, there is a story behind the story. I would hesitate to be castigatory until we have got more facts.Senator Dooley agreed with Senator Norris, particularly with regard to Ennis, and we saw on television last night the great welcome the town gave to the athletes. The same welcome was extended everywhere, in wee villages as well as larger population areas, but the Senator is right and I am glad that matter concerning Travellers in the town was resolved quickly.Senator Sheila Terry talked also about rushing the Bill, saying that they would be here all day. Our spokespersons have voices and will be here all day too.

As Senators may be aware, the proposals in the Bill arise from the Government's commitment in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in the State. The question of incorporating the convention into domestic law has had to be further examined in that context. Before I elaborate on the Bill's detail, I would like to deal generally with its wider background and outline some of the complex legal and policy issues which had to be considered and resolved in drafting it.The Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was adopted by the Council of Europe in Rome and signed by the then Minister for External Affairs on 4 November 1950. Its provisions were formally ratified by Ireland on 25 February 1953 and the convention entered into force on 3 September that year. At that time Ireland also accepted the articles in the convention which permitted the right of individual petition to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg by citizens and states against states involving alleged breaches of the convention. States generally were very slow to take up this option. At the time the convention came into force, Ireland and Sweden were the only contracting states permitting such petitions.The only basis on which the State could ratify the European Convention on Human Rights was that it was compatible with the Constitution. There was no sense in which the State could ratify the convention if it was at variance or inconsistent with the Constitution. On occasion some who should know better seem to think that the convention is somehow superior to the Constitution in Irish law. Nothing could be further from the truth.It should be acknowledged – something not often done, especially by some who specialise in human rights – that the Constitution is the only republican constitution in the European Union with a set of human rights provisions at its heart which are unalterable except at the insistence of the people through a referendum on foot of parliamentary legislation. It is also the only such constitution with human rights provisions justiciable by the people against the State in independent courts, even to the point of over-riding the legislation of the Oireachtas and any Act of any Government or any aspect of the Executive power of the State. The Irish people are the only people in Europe who have a republican constitution with that mechanism at its core. Sometimes people believe we have an inferior or inadequate system for the protection of human rights.De Valera's achievement in 1937 was effectively the blending of parliamentary democracy with the American system of court supervision of a written constitution.That was a huge achievement which should not be devalued. Unfortunately, one reads newspaper articles these days by people who believe the convention contains a different source of human rights for the country superior to the Constitution in both content and legal status. Nothing could be further from the truth.It is also wrong to imply there is an entire corpus of convention rights wholly distinguishable from the personal rights accorded to Irish citizens under the Constitution. This is also trotted out regularly as the basis for criticism of this Bill, among others – that in some sense we are short-changing the people because we are not incorporating into Irish law a corpus of rights floating around and which only require political will and ambition to anchor and hold for the people of this jurisdiction.There is only one right to freedom in our law, the right guaranteed by the Constitution. The same applies to the right to free speech and other rights, numerated and unenumerated, in the Constitution. They exist as a matter of constitutional right and entitlement for citizens and do not derive from or depend on the convention. People speak about the convention right to family and marriage. I emphasise that the Constitution deals with that issue also and that the only reason we subscribed to and ratified the convention was that it was consistent with the Constitution, not vice versa.In general terms, the convention protects what are universally accepted as the basic civil and political rights in any democratic state. These are the right to life; the right to freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom from slavery, servitude or forced compulsory labour; the right to liberty and security of the person; the right to fair and public trial within a reasonable time; the right to freedom from retrospective criminal law and no punishment without law; the right to respect for private and family life as well as home and correspondence; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; the right to freedom of expression; the right to marry and found a family; the right to an effective remedy for violation of rights as set out in the convention and prohibition of discrimination in the enjoyment of those rights.Senators will note that most of the up-to-date texts of the convention and its four main operational protocols, also being given effect in our law, are appended to the Bill for ease of reference. The 1952 protocol deals with property, educational and electoral rights. The fourth protocol contains, among other things, the right to freedom of movement and also prohibits individual or collective expulsion of nationals. The sixth protocol deals with the abolition of the death penalty while the seventh contains procedural safeguards concerning the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens, the right of appeal in criminal matters, compensation for wrongful conviction and the right not to be punished twice for the same offence, and equality between spouses.When the State decided to sign up to these international agreements, an important factor to be taken into account was that we were in a position to meet our obligations under them by virtue of having a Bill of Rights under the 1937 Constitution. I make no apology for stating again and again that we are alone among the member states of the European Union and other states on the Council of Europe in having a written Constitution which embodies a system of fundamental rights chosen by the people which are unalterable save by the wish of the people and made superior and justiciable at the instance of the individual over all other law both in theory and in practice.Our excellent human rights record before the Court of Human Rights, unrivalled in the Council of Europe, is testament to the efficacy of the protection we provided for ourselves before the convention was ever open for ratification. Its hallmark has been its development by the superior courts through the doctrine of unenumerated personal rights and largely by means of judicial review of legislation. It goes without saying an important consideration for any government contemplating taking on board the convention's provisions is the relationship in that government's legal system between international law, as represented by the convention, and its own internal domestic law.Members would be advised to bear in mind that in the civil law systems in Europe, there is a hierarchy of legal rights and obligations in the majority of cases. Under the civil law system, the constitution comes first, then international treaty and then domestic law. That is not the case under our system because this is a common law state and our system is different. At the top comes the Constitution, then the Oireachtas and its legislation and finally international agreements in so far as they are made part of our law by the Oireachtas. We have a different fundamental philosophy of where international treaty obligations come on the pyramid of the legal hierarchy. It is expressly provided in our Constitution that no international agreement is part of our domestic law save to the extent determined by the Oireachtas, which must act in accordance with the Constitution.In some states, for example, it is accepted that there is no real separation between international and domestic law and both are regarded as part of a unified system. Under this monist theory, the international rules may well take precedence over national provisions. Other systems, however, including that in Ireland, adhere to the dualist theory and they regard international law and domestic law as totally separate. Under these systems, international law does not become part of the internal law unless it is explicitly made so. What this means is that rules embodied in an international instrument, such as the convention, cannot be enforced in our courts unless and until they are incorporated into our law by an Act of the Oireachtas.While the convention is law for the State on the international plain since 1953 – citizens were given right of recourse to the court in Strasbourg since then because Ireland was confident it would be fully compatible with its Constitution – its provisions do not apply with the force of law within this State. That does not mean, however, that the convention is merely an academic source of rights protection. By virtue of the State's acceptance of the right of individual petition, cases can and have been on occasion brought to Strasbourg alleging that the State is in breach of the convention in particular respects. The decision of the court in these matters is binding on the State, but, under our constitutional system, it is the prerogative of the Government to decide precisely how incompatible provisions of national law or administrative practice are to be reconciled with the court's ruling.When I refer to Government in this sense, I mean the Government and the Oireachtas. Examples of how this works in practice may be found in areas of Access to Justice: An Introduction of the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid, advice following the Josie Airey case in the late 1970s and the changes in the criminal law on homosexual offences as a result of the Norris case in 1988.There are some disadvantages with this method of vindication of convention rights. The process requires that all domestic remedies be first tried and exhausted before the matter is pleaded in Strasbourg. That can be quite a costly, time consuming and lengthy procedure. In all cases, it involves taking a constitutional action all the way to the Supreme Court. Furthermore, with the number of states acceding to the convention increasing all the time, the caseload of the Strasbourg court is growing exponentially and there are longer delays in prospect as a result.In that context, and against the background of changes already effected in Northern Ireland due the enactment of the 1998 Human Rights Act in the United Kingdom and the obligation on the Government under the Good Friday Agreement, there is now a need to provide that cases involving alleged breaches of the convention should be capable of being pleaded before national courts. That is the purpose of the Bill.It made sense, therefore, in any examination of the choices open to the Government in the matter of providing how the provisions of the convention could be made applicable in the State, rather than for the State as a consequence of our obligations under international law, to look closely at the sub-constitutional interpretative model in the 1998 Human Rights Act adopted for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Other possible options explored included direct incorporation of the relevant articles of the convention in the Constitution. This would have to be effected by changes in the relevant articles of the Constitution as agreed by the people in a referendum.In that regard, the Constitution Review Group in its 1996 report came out strongly against such a course on the grounds that there is already a high degree of overlap between the Constitution's guarantees in the area of fundamental rights and the provisions of the convention. The group was of the opinion that this form of incorporation could very well lead to a diminution in some individual rights in the Constitution. They also believed that this method of incorporation would not have the effect of filling any gaps in human rights protection, since every substantive right afforded by the convention is either expressly protected by the Constitution, or has been recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right under Article 40.3.1 of the Constitution.Significantly, the group also thought that incorporation of the convention in the Constitution might give rise to new gaps in protection in fundamentally important areas, such as the right to trial by jury. There is one further serious question associated with this option which the Constitution Review Group did not address, whether changes of this order of magnitude in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms would be carried by a sufficient majority of the people in a referendum.In effect, if the European Convention rights were to be incorporated into the Irish Constitution, in terms, the question would then arise as to who was the authoritative and final determinant of what they meant. Would it be the Irish people, would it be the Irish Supreme Court or would it be the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg? People who have suggested direct incorporation into our Constitution never stress the obvious implication of that argument, that a section of the Irish Constitution would cease to mean what the Irish people necessarily thought it meant, or what the Supreme Court interpreted it to mean. It would mean whatever a court not responsible or accountable to the Irish people interpreted it to mean. That would mean a cession of sovereignty in respect of fundamental rights to a court over which we have no direct influence, in the sense that we have over our domestic courts, independent though they are.Another solution which at first seemed attractive was for the convention to have the force of law in the State or to make the convention part of the law of the State. This view is held by a number of interested organisations, including the Human Rights Commission, and it deserves serious scrutiny. Most of the debate in the other House – and in the committee of the other House – centred on that particular issue and many amendments were tabled to the Bill accordingly.However, it was my view when Attorney General, as it is the view of the present Attorney General, accepted by the Government, that the fatal flaw with such an approach is that it would have the capacity to undermine one of the central pillars of the Constitution, namely the doctrine of separation of powers. It would mean the Oireachtas was investing the Judiciary with a new right to invalidate the laws of the Oireachtas by reference to what was decided by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In effect, the Judiciary would become law makers, implementing decisions of that court contrary to the exclusive role of the Oireachtas under Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution.In the final analysis the Government decided on an interpretative approach which is similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom, but it is done for entirely different reasons and not out of slavish imitation. In the United Kingdom the argument offered for the interpretative approach was largely to do with parliamentary sovereignty. In this State, given that it is a constitutional Republic, we have adopted the approach we have because of our doctrine of constitutional sovereignty and the supremacy of the will of the people. I should say it is a happy coincidence that for two entirely different sets of reasons these two jurisdictions, which have a shared role in the human rights perspective as it affects both parts of this island, have arrived at broadly similar conclusions as to how the common law system, which is different from the civil law system, can be fully harmonised with the European Convention of Human Rights. That is why we have done this the way we have.Believe it or not, it is just two years since my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, presented the Bill at Second Stage in the other House. That was on the 14 June 2001 and the Bill was referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on that day.The committee engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process, but the Bill was not scheduled for discussion in committee up to the time of the dissolution of the previous Dáil. Following the formation of the present Dáil the committee as reconstituted in late 2002 gave all interested parties and organisations further opportunities to address it on the subject matter of the Bill. Following the conclusion of that process, the examination of the Bill in committee took place earlier this year on 18 and 19 February, 5 March and concluded on 12 March 2003. Report Stage commenced on 21 May and continued on 10 June, with the passing of the Bill in the other House on 11 June 2003.Members may be surprised, in view of that lengthy history, to see that the Bill contains just nine sections. It is, nevertheless, quite a complex and controversial measure, and to some extent that explains why it has taken so long to get to this point in its passage through the Oireachtas. As a measure of that complexity, 52 Committee Stage amendments were tabled to the Bill. At Report Stage that number rose to 61. The complexity arises from the fact that, as I have explained, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the harmonious co-existence of two separate streams of rights and fundamental freedoms. One such stream is the existing one founded on constitutional sovereignty contained in the fundamental rights articles in the 1937 Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann. This incorporates our system of judicial supervision and protection of those rights – something as I remarked earlier that is unique among our fellow contracting states of the Council of Europe, and which must remain paramount. The second stream is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which of itself is not a constitutional document. It was never meant to be a constitution for the contracting states and does not actually require that its provisions be incorporated into national legal systems. It is, nevertheless, an international human rights instrument to which the State is bound in international law, and under which the State has agreed to allow individual citizens the right of access to an international court to determine whether it is in breach of its obligations under it. A further layer of complexity is caused by the fact that under the Constitution, the sole and exclusive maker of laws in this State is the Oireachtas.How is it possible to preserve these constitutional and legislative prerogatives and yet still provide that the provisions of the convention can be pleaded in and acted upon by our courts? These are the turbulent waters into which we are now moving. I hope to show that the correct course open to us is the one set out in the route map laid down in the Bill which is now before the House for consideration.Section 1 provides for the definition of certain words and phrases used in the Bill. These definitions, by listing the applicable convention provisions and by defining the term "organ of the State", to which the main obligations in section 3 regarding the performance of functions applies, are fundamentally important. The term "Convention provisions" set out in the Bill includes Articles 2 to 14 of the convention as well as the applicable provisions of the four main protocols to the convention. The full and up to date texts of all of these instruments are set out in Schedules 1 to 5, inclusive, to the Bill.Two recent additional protocols to the convention, Protocol 12 dealing with the substantive issue of discrimination, which we have signed subject to ratification, and Protocol 13 dealing with the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances – which, following the result of the recent constitutional referendum, we have signed and ratified as well – are not included in the Bill simply because their provisions are not yet in force. Article 1 of the convention is not included but there is no need to do so. This is due to the fact that the obligation to respect human rights as defined by the convention, and to secure them to everyone within the jurisdiction of the contracting states to the convention, has already been accepted by the State since the time it ratified the convention and its coming into effect in 1953. That obligation has been binding on us since that time and that is the reason the Long Title refers to the Bill giving further effect to the convention.It is worth noting that Article 13 of the convention which provides for the right to an effective remedy for breaches of the convention is expressly included. In this respect we are going somewhat further than the 1988 Human Rights Act in the UK which omitted this Article from its scope. The term "organ of the State" excludes the courts as well as the President, either House of the Oireachtas, or a committee or joint committee of both Houses. There has been criticism over the exclusion of the courts based on the fact that they are expressly included in the UK Human Rights Act. However, the United Kingdom's courts are not bound by a written constitution. Its judiciary is bound by an oath to the sovereign power which is obliged to do whatever parliament says it can do. In that respect it is fundamentally different from the position of our Judiciary. Our judges, by their declaration, are bound to uphold our Constitution, regardless of what Parliament says or does to them – to the extent that Parliament's wishes are inconsistent with the true meaning and interpretation of the Constitution.The courts are under a duty to administer justice in accordance with the law and the Constitution. Furthermore, as the convention is primarily a vertically effective instrument – by which I mean that it is designed as a means for redressing human rights violations between the individual and the State – the inclusion of the courts could result in their being drawn into its development as a horizontally effective means of resolving rights-based disputes between individuals. I do not want to create a new set of actionable torts consisting of breach of convention rights as between individuals, nor do I want to see a development whereby people, under sections 3(1) and 3(2), would be able to sue the courts in respect of court decisions. I have stated clearly that I am not interested in that kind of experimentation and that I will not go down that road.It must be stressed that the term "statutory provision", defined in section 1 as meaning any Act of the Oireachtas or any order, regulation, rule, licence, by-law or any other like document made, issued or otherwise created under any statute or by law, also includes every statute establishing the courts and every statutory instrument in which court rules are provided. All the legislation on which the courts are based, subject to the Constitution, and every rule of court which is a statutory instrument is encompassed by this Act. Members will see, as we examine the provisions of the Bill, that the courts are obliged to regard their own establishing legislation and their own rules of procedure, as laid down in statutory instruments, in a manner consistent with the convention to the greatest extent possible.Section 2 is the first of the three key provisions in the Bill. It gave rise to some confusion in the Lower House so I will provide this House with some further information on it. The section provides that any statutory provision, in the widest possible sense, as well as any provision of the rules of common law – such as the rule against hearsay, compellability of a spouse or any rule of law of that kind which is not found in statute – shall be interpreted as far as possible in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention. This provision applies to laws made both before and after the passing of the Bill. It is both prospective and retrospective and is a thorough and potentially far-reaching interpretative obligation. I remarked in the Lower House that the obligation on the courts to interpret our laws applies to the extent that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the State's obligations under the convention. This rule applies to all courts – the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court – at all times and it is subject to the Constitution.Each court will make its own decision on the question of compatibility. In any ordinary case, if an issue arises as to the compatibility of any law or rule of law with the convention, both the District Court and the Circuit Court are obliged, as a matter of legal interpretation, to do their best and see a convention-compatible interpretation of any law or rule of law before them. Ordinarily, these decisions may be set aside on appeal one way or the other. There is no question of references upwards or downwards, except perhaps by means of the consultative case stated procedure.Section 3 is another key provision and none of the Bill's critics has ever adverted to it in substance. It provides that every organ of the State, as defined in section 1, must perform its functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention. One might ask why the courts, the President or Oireachtas are not included in this regard, but we have a sovereign state and it is up to Members of the Oireachtas to decide how to exercise the sovereign power of the people in given circumstances. One Oireachtas cannot bind another Oireachtas, nor can both Houses of the Oireachtas bind either House regarding how it should conduct its business. This is what is involved in Ireland being a sovereign, independent republic.If an organ of the State fails to carry out its functions in a matter incompatible with the State's obligations under the convention, section 3 provides a remedy in damages in the Circuit Court or the High Court. There is a time limit of one year, within which such actions may be brought, although this can be extended if the court considers it is appropriate to do so in the interests of justice.This is a very far-reaching provision and goes much further than the equivalent provision in the United Kingdom. It gives to the High Court and the Circuit Court jurisdiction, in accordance with the levels of damages that those two courts have at present for torts, to award compensation to anybody who claims that any organ of the State, as defined in the Act, has infringed his or her rights under the Constitution. It provides for what could be described as a new tort, and the level of compensation envisaged is not what I would term convention-related compensation which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 41 of the convention, is not regarded as being overly generous.This remedy is not available in the District Court, but there are reasons for that. The District Court is charged with dispensing summary civil and criminal justice, which it does, and it has a considerable volume of work to do. Convention-based cases, by their nature, are complex and require considerable attention. As Senators will know, the District Court does not have jurisdiction in equity or defamation cases, injunctions or applications for judicial review, principally because these cases require a huge investment of time to process properly.Section 3 does not refer to the other remedies which may be relevant in cases of this type, such as injunctions, declarations, what used to be called certiorari, quashing orders and orders like mandamus, all of which are now called judicial review. It is not necessary to refer to them. If a person wishes to injunct a State body from carrying out a function of one kind or another, one does so in the High Court by means of orders for judicial review. There is no need to replicate in large measure the law relating to judicial review and convention issues will be melded into judicial review law. Contrary to some of the criticisms that have been expressed about this particular provision, if one takes into account our existing law on judicial review and the far-reaching effect of the requirement in section 2 whereby the courts have to do their utmost to bring about compatibility of interpretation, one will find that this Bill represents a very robust system of enforcement of convention based rights.Section 4 deals with the technical issue of judicial notice and interpretation of convention provisions and the jurisprudence of the convention court. I accepted an amendment in this respect on Report Stage in the other House.Section 5 is the third key provision in the Bill. It deals with the making of declarations of incompatibility by the superior courts and the consequences of such a decision. Due to the fact that the particular statutory provision which may be found incompatible with the convention may also be entirely valid under the Constitution, difficult jurisprudential issues arise. Under our Constitution, this House, the Dáil and the President form the Oireachtas, in which the sole and exclusive right to make laws for the State is vested. It is not a paper-based monopoly, but the outward expression of sovereignty on which Irish republicanism is based, that is, the right of the people, through the Legislature and subject to the Constitution, to determine their laws.We have a system in which our courts interpret the law and they do so subject to one overriding rule, namely, that every organ of the State, including the Oireachtas, is bound to uphold the Constitution. While the people are free to amend the Constitution through referendum, the bodies with the ultimate right to decide what it means are the High Court and the Supreme Court on appeal. Nobody else's interpretation of the Constitution is valid or coercive as a matter of law. Neither House of the Oireachtas can direct the courts to interpret laws by reference to the decisions of a third party, such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.There have been ten occasions over the past 50 years when the Irish courts have been found by the European Court of Human Rights to have failed to vindicate a person's rights to the extent required by the convention. This represents one case every five years. Sometimes we engage in self-flagellation over such matters, but, compared to many other states, some of which would regard themselves as the cradles of democracy, and others of which bestow similar epithets upon themselves, our record is remarkably clear of breaches of the convention.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I say that not complacently but to make the point that the reason this is so is that we have a written Constitution and that ordinary citizens bring the Oireachtas and the Government to court, and beat them, on a regular basis by reference to the same rights, however stated in the Constitution.Four of the cases involved what might be broadly described as sexual and family themes. I can say fairly and without being guilty of caricaturing them they were cases where attitudes in Ireland on sexual and family matters – they were certainly attitudinal on the part of the Judiciary in interpretation – were at variance with what would be internationally thought to be fundamental rights and liberties in these areas.This compares dramatically with other jurisdictions where the figure in some cases runs to hundreds of occasions and in countries which would regard themselves as bastions of human rights protection to many tens of cases. Four of the cases might be broadly described as involving sexual and family law themes, the fifth concerned access to the courts and the absence of civil legal aid, another dealt with a planning matter, three centred on one point arising from the provisions of section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, remarkably as one eminent commentator stated, because they represent the only pressure placed on our criminal legal system by the overspill of 30 years of civil conflict in Northern Ireland. The most recent case concerned a troubled adolescent and the lack of proper facilities. That is a pen picture of the occasions on which we have been brought to book in Strasbourg.Section 52 was a provision of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 which required people to give an account of their movements. The House will be aware that those arrested under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 could be required under section 52 to give an account of their movements to the police and convicted if they remained silent in certain circumstances. This created a catch 22 for many arrested under the section because, on the one hand, they were told they were not obliged to make a statement and that, under the Judges' Rules and the Irish equivalent of Miranda jurisprudence, they were not obliged to say anything unless they wished to do so and that anything they did say would be taken down in writing and might be used in evidence against them. Later in the same interview the Offences Against the State Act would be plonked down on the table in front of the person concerned who would be informed that the rules had suddenly changed and he or she would be required to tell something and that for failure to give an account of his or her movements he or she would be sentenced to ten months imprisonment. This put the accused person in a cruel dilemma. On the one hand, he or she knew he or she had committed an offence if he or she failed to account for his or her movements or gave an untruthful account but if he or she gave a truthful account, the notebooks would be out and he or she would face a conviction on foot of his or her confession.It is the case that the Heeney and McGuinness cases, the subject of those three cases, were decided against the persons convicted in the Supreme Court. It was by no means clear to many lawyers at the time that the Supreme Court was coercively driven in that direction. Subsequently, in the National Irish Banks company investigation case which came before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court realised there was a constitutional right against being forced to incriminate oneself, even by statute, and that the State could not use compelled statements by an accused person to bring about criminal convictions.I say all of this because sometimes we are lashed verbally in the media as a society which has been derelict in the area of human rights. I ask the House to fairly judge over more than 50 years of adherence to the convention, whether this amounts to a record of a society which is highly litigious and legally aware and in which there is an inadequate protection of human rights.Referring to the Norris case, I am sure Senator Norris will not mind me saying it was by no means clear to lawyers that the Supreme Court would make the decision it did in respect of his personal and private life. If those cases had been decided in the opposite way, our record would be even more remarkable. In those cases there were minorities who thought the Supreme Court was, in effect, getting it wrong. No system is free from debate or division as to what is right or wrong. We should recognise that our High Court and Supreme Court have been a remarkable system of protection for civil and political liberties and rights within society. Nothing, therefore, that I say should be taken as critical of them, just to say that on the few occasions where Homer nodded in terms of constitutional rights of the individual, as some of us would like to see them interpreted, there has been the European Convention on Human Rights on which people could rely and, in the last analysis, get corrective action taken.Section 5(2)(a) is designed to take account of the fact that it is not possible to create a law which entitles the Irish courts to compensate people for the consequences of legislative Acts which are intra vires the Constitution and where no legal wrong has been done to them. Put simply, this means that if it is constitutional for this and the other House to enact a law inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights, it is not possible for the courts to demand from the State compensation for upholding or implementing the law laid down by this House. This does not mean nothing can be done about such cases. If a party was successful in obtaining a declaration of incompatibility, it did not make much sense if it was then faced with a choice of either going to the Court of Human Rights solely on the issue of quantum of damages or abandoning its right to compensation. How would this square with our intention to give further effect to the convention at home? This is the very issue faced by people in the same situation in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, in particular. This is where section 5(4) comes in. It provides for a person in this situation to apply for ex gratia compensation from the State without the trouble and expense of having to go to Strasbourg to obtain it. However, the right which has existed since 1953 to take the Strasbourg route is still there, should the person wish to pursue it. If he or she decides to take the  ex gratia option, the Government under section 5(5) can request an adviser to consider the amount of compensation, taking into account the principles and practice of the European Court in Strasbourg to afford just satisfaction in accordance with Article 41 of the convention.When a law is found to be incompatible, section 3(3) provides that the Taoiseach shall cause a copy of the declaration of incompatibility to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within a period of 21 days in order that this House and Dáil Éireann would be put on notice that a particular problem of incompatibility had to be rectified by the organs of Government and State. I say this because some have got this somewhat skewed. What is envisaged, for example, is that if Senator Norris was to be in the same position now as he was then, he would do now what he did then, challenge the legality of the law with which he did not agree up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court if it was minded to make the same decision again – I do not think it would – would say the particular Act he was claiming was unconstitutional was incompatible with the Constitution. It would, nonetheless, be in a position to say it was compatible with the Constitution but incompatible with the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg convention. It would then hand him a declaratory order which he could lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas stating that, although it was consistent with the Constitution, it was inconsistent with the convention. This will never ever happen except in the most extreme of cases.The Supreme Court will not find many cases where there is a significant margin of difference between the human rights guaranteed by the 1953 convention and the human rights guaranteed by the State. As time goes by the occasions, such as the Heaney, McGuinness and Senator Norris cases, which are a handful of cases where people have failed to get constitutional redress, will almost certainly disappear. They will become, in mathematical terms, asymptotic with a zero axis. They will cease.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	This Bill, when it becomes law, will create a European Convention on Human Rights consciousness in our jurisprudence. It will be a rare case where the right to free speech or freedom of expression will be interpreted differently by the Supreme Court from a fair interpretation of the convention provisions. Where such cases arise, the individual will not have to go to Strasbourg to have the difference between Irish and Strasbourg law identified and stated. The Irish courts will be in a position to state it on their own account and in such circumstances the State will then be confronted, before anyone has to go to Strasbourg or to leave the island in legal terms, with the opportunity to amend the law to get it into accordance with the Strasbourg convention. There is also a mechanism in those circumstances to give the person the same level of compensation that he or she would have got had he or she gone to Strasbourg. This is not just a matter of right, because the State has the right to have laws incompatible with Strasbourg, but a matter of ex gratia payment in order to remove from a person in those circumstances any need to go to Strasbourg to get remedial action.It is theoretically possible that both Houses of the Oireachtas in their wisdom, with the declaratory order handed down by the court, will simply say, "We refuse to change the law as we are happy with the way it is." That is the act of a sovereign Legislature and no more can be said about it. The person in question would then have to go to Strasbourg and argue, before the court established under the Council of Europe convention, that Ireland was in breach of its obligations to him or her. That is possible. However, I believe the increasing effect of this Bill will be that such situations will not arise. I am confident the Bill deals with most of the problems ever likely to arise in a way which is consistent with, and recognises the supremecy of, our Constitution.Section 6 provides that before a court decides to make a declaration of incompatibility the Attorney General, as legal adviser to the Government, will have to be given notice under rules of court and will be entitled to appear in the proceedings and become a party to them. I accepted an amendment in the Dáil to include the Human Rights Commission also because, as the House knows, it has the right to ask to be heard in court cases dealing with human rights decisions.In accordance with the provisions of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, the commission will have the right to apply to be heard as amicus curiae in those proceedings. This point was debated in the other House on the basis that the commission should have an automatic right to be heard in these types of cases. However, the provision giving the commission a right to apply to be heard was deliberately framed in that way in the relevant Act to allow a court to take account of all the factors in such a case, including the paramount consideration of being fair as between individual parties, before making a decision on the matter.Section 7 in its original form was amended in committee in the other House to take account of the fact that the increase in the membership of the Human Rights Commission was effected in a separate Act namely, the Human Rights Commission (Amendment) Act 2001. Its purpose now is to ensure that the full role and remit of the commission, including the power to take legal action, will extend to cases involving our expanded human rights protection by virtue of the provisions of this Bill.Section 8 is the usual expenses provision. Section 9, to which a technical amendment was made in the Dáil, contains the Short Title of the Bill and the commencement provision.I thank the House for its generosity in the time it will give this important Bill. I will listen attentively to the contributions of Senators. I hope they will agree that it represents the strongest form of incorporation of the convention in our domestic law consistent with constitutional considerations. Although my critics have been blunt and direct in their criticism of this Bill, I believe that right is on the Government side of the argument and that what we have done is compatible with what will be the situation in Northern Ireland in particular. Other models of incorporation were suggested, such as constitutional incorporation, or a hopelessly ill-fated suggestion that it should be sub-constitutional but nonetheless systemic incorporation as law of the State. If they had been followed, the legal situation North and South of the Border would have been radically different in regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and the way in which the courts approach it. I strongly believe that, as a result of this, the day will come when, on most human rights issues, county courts in Northern Ireland and the High Court in Belfast – admittedly there are different constitutional arrangements in both parts of this island – will address most cases on the basis of the same principles, or at least on the basis of a mutually shared set of interpretative goals.In this context, and in the presence of Senator Mansergh, I pay tribute to those who negotiated the Good Friday Agreement. I regret that this particular outworking and implementation of the Agreement, which is in one sense part of our acts of completion, has taken so long. The substantial arguments were real and the delay was not a question of indolence or indifference to the issue. Passionate, well articulated arguments were made on both sides, on paper, in public and in the other House. Whereas all delay is unfortunate, this delay has served as useful in one respect. It has enabled all the issues to be carefully investigated.The outcome of the process is that Irish law, the legal ambiance here and the jurisprudence of our courts at both constitutional and sub-constitutional levels will now be such as to give both the courts and the citizens who appear before them new guarantees that the corpus of law reflected in Strasbourg jurisprudence is not just something out there to be accessed as a court of final appeal but has been brought "holus-bolus" into the Irish legal system. Almost like genetic modification, it has been brought into the system so that every cell, every legal decision will now be informed by the principles of the convention as indeed they should.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I welcome the Minister to the House. As he has been on his feet for over 50 minutes I hope he has not exhausted himself. He will have a long day and will, perhaps, be back with us this afternoon. It is a busy week for all of us.The proposals in this Bill, and those which led to the setting up of the Human Rights Commission, can be traced back to the provisions in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement relating to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. The convention protects the basic civil and political rights in any democratic state. From the outset, Ireland was an enthusiastic supporter of the European Convention on Human Rights. It was one of the ten original parties to the convention and one of the first countries to allow citizens to take cases directly to the European Commission and Court of Human Rights. This resulted in a number of important decisions in Irish cases to which the Minister has already alluded.Ireland has a system which regards international and domestic law as totally separate. In practice this means that rules embodied in an international instrument, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, cannot be enforced in our courts unless and until it is incorporated into our law by an Act of the Oireachtas. At the moment it is the prerogative of the Government to decide precisely how any incompatible provision of national law or administrative practice may be reconciled with a ruling by the court. This means that if a person wishes to vindicate his or her right under the convention, he or she must first exhaust all possible domestic remedies which may be availed of under national law, before going on to plead his or her case before the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The latter has proved to be costly and inaccessible for most people, a point with which the Minister agrees.Ireland has fallen behind other counties in dealing with the issues. However, I accept the Minister's reasons for this being the case. The UK dealt with this matter in October 2000. The Good Friday Agreement commits Ireland to "ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland." The convention is already part of ordinary law in Northern Ireland through the UK's Human Rights Act.The Bill proposes to bring the convention more fully into Irish law by making rights under the convention enforceable in Irish courts. However, I have a problem with the method by which the Minister proposes to do this, the reasons for which have already been put to him in the Dáil. The Bill does not propose to incorporate the convention into Irish law, only to give it more effect in this jurisdiction. The Fine Gael Party believes that the European Convention on Human Rights should be adopted directly as part of our legislation. We agree with the views expressed by the Human Rights Commission, the Bar Council, the Law Society of Ireland and others, that the convention should be placed in a superior position to ordinary laws, subject only to the Constitution, and should be capable of direct enforcement by means of all appropriate judicial remedies before the Irish courts. The Minister has adopted a minimalist approach to this important matter and the bodies to which I have just referred disagree. Why does the Minister feel he is omnipotent in this matter? He makes a good case, but why do these bodies still disagree with him?Under section 5, the High Court or Supreme Court, where no other legal remedy is adequate, may make a declaration that an item of legislation is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but the litigant can obtain no other legal redress and the legislation remains in force. The Taoiseach must then draw the making of the order to the attention of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the litigant may apply to the Attorney General for compensation. However, the Government is under no obligation to pay such compensation, although it may or may not make an ex gratia payment. The Government may appoint someone to advise it as to the amount of such compensation, if any, and may in its' discretion make a payment of the amount aforesaid, or of such other amount as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.This is a weakness in the Bill, which I will seek to address by means of an amendment on Committee Stage. The Minister has accepted that the litigant may still have to go to the European Court to obtain an effective remedy. In which case, the object of domesticating the European Convention on Human Rights so as to give quick relief to citizens in our courts will have been defeated.Where there is a right, there is a remedy. This is a basic principle of Irish constitutional law, enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution. It is unacceptable to place the courts in a position where they can identify a breach of human rights and yet not be in a position to offer an effective remedy. The procedure set out in section 5 is, therefore, one of constitutional validity. Moreover, it is difficult to understand how one can purport to incorporate Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires the provision of an effective remedy at national level, into domestic law, while withholding a domestic judicial remedy for a breach of the convention. Strasbourg case law establishes the principle that a discretionary remedy is no remedy.Litigants may find themselves with no other option but to go to Strasbourg and the Human Rights Commission should be in a position to help them to do so. The commission has recommended that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should issue a policy directive, under section 7 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, to the effect that applications for legal aid will be considered in suitable cases under the Bill. If a constitutional-type action is necessary under the Human Rights Commission Acts 2000 and 2001, or the Bill before us, it is essential to establish who has the primary responsibility for funding the action. I suggest that the one-year limitation period prescribed by section 3(5) be extended to six years, which is the general limitation period for tort claims and is another recommendation of the Human Rights Commission.I realise that the Bill has been through the Dáil and that it took a long time to get here. Now that it is before the House, however, it is being rushed through. We are dealing with Second Stage today and we will take Committee Stage tomorrow. I look forward to further debate on Committee Stage, as well as the Minister's response to some of the issues I have raised.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I welcome the Minister. We have already discussed this legislation at committee level. The Minister has given a good background to the ambit of our human rights record within our legislation and the effects of the European Convention for the Protection Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It must be remembered that this is a binding international treaty from the Council of Europe. It is interesting that it was ratified by Ireland in 1953. Ireland and Sweden are recorded as the first countries to accept the right of petition to the European Court of Human Rights. Like Ireland, Sweden has a good track record in this area.It is also worth noting that the convention laid the foundation for a new Europe. Inasmuch as necessity is the mother of invention, through adversity often come positive things. The European Convention on Human Rights came about as a consequence of the wars that ravaged Europe in the first half of the last century. Like the UN, it is an example of good coming from the difficulties which were experienced across the globe, but particularly in Europe, at that time. We have had occasion in this House to compliment Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman on the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, which became the European Community and which has progressed to the benefit of all the citizens of Europe. Again, this was probably a direct consequence of atrocities such as the Holocaust, which highlighted man's inhumanity to man in a most graphic way.In the context of this debate, it is important to recognise and remember the genesis of the European Convention on Human Rights. It came from an acceptance that where there were totalitarian regimes and dictatorships in which democracy was displaced, there were severe infringements of human rights. We have been fortunate in Ireland in avoiding the worst effects of that. The Minister outlined our legal framework, which is founded on our Constitution and which has ensured that we have been at the forefront in this area.The convention protects the right to life; the right to freedom from torture and slavery; the right to liberty and security of the person; the right to a fair and public trial, that there be no punishment without law; the right to respect for private and family life in one's home; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association. This could be regarded as belt and braces legislation in that many of the convention's provisions are probably explicitly provided for in the Constitution and, where this is not the case, they are implicit.When it is considered that the Constitution dates back to 1937, it must be acknowledged that its architects showed remarkable foresight and capacity for comprehensive thinking. The Minister rightly acknowledged that de Valera and his Government deserved great commendation for this. Unfortunately, partisan politics has to some extent been a motivation in deriding aspects of the Constitution which has stood the test of time. Almost 70 years later, citizens rely on its text to ensure and protect their rights in society and under the law.It is interesting that we, as legislators, cannot supersede any of the Constitution's provisions. The right to change the Constitution rests with the people by way of referendum. Apart from Switzerland, it is probably more progressive in that regard than in any other civilised or democratic country.On the question of security, it must be asked if there is a hierarchy of rights and occasions arise when there are competing priorities in terms of vindicating them. In this regard and in order to protect the security of the individual, the State has considered it prudent to enact prevention of terrorism legislation which may, in normal circumstances, be considered unnecessary. For example, the legislation providing that a Garda chief superintendent can give evidence that may be accepted by a court would normally not be considered desirable, when more substantial proof would be required.The House has debated crime on previous occasions. I mentioned the case involving Brian Fitzgerald but others are relevant, including that of Veronica Guerin, who was murdered in the course of pursuing organised crime involving drugs importation. It took her murder to get society to accept that action we might otherwise have considered to be a little extreme could be taken. The Criminal Assets Bureau and similar legislation has been effective. In the murder of Brian Fitzgerald and other similar murders involving organised crime, the Garda can often identify not only the organised crime gang but also the professional hitman, yet the lack of sufficient evidence to prosecute a case means they remain at large. It means that the security and life – the most fundamental of all rights – of certain individuals are put at risk. In this context, I hope the courts and the Legislature will consider the convention in a manner that will balance the competing priorities in terms of rights. In this regard, a number of responsible law abiding citizens who have never been in trouble with the law have told me that they would willingly sacrifice some of their civil liberties to ensure greater security for themselves and their families.Interestingly, the explanatory memorandum points out that the convention has been the law for Ireland for the past 50 years but was not law in Ireland. For a person to vindicate his or her rights under the convention he or she would have to exhaust all remedies in domestic law and then, if necessary, pursue the case in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The Bill fundamentally alters this by providing that people can bring their case in an Irish court. This has arisen in part because of the Government's commitment under the Good Friday Agreement, although it may have happened in any event. The Minister has argued it will mean that an equivalence will pertain between this jurisdiction and the situation pertaining in Northern Ireland, which has arisen from the implementation of the 1998 Act passed in the United Kingdom.Enactment of the law is not enough, however; the culture of respect for the law is also important. Northern Ireland is a prime example of a jurisdiction where, in many instances, human rights have been disregarded. It is especially regrettable that some organs of the British state should have been involved in this. Many in the House and elsewhere will be familiar with the cases involving Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson and those murdered in the Dublin and Monagahan bombings and Sackville Place. Atrocities were committed which at the time appeared to have had a political motive. In view of what has been exposed, it would be reasonable to assume that there was collusion and involvement. The only question to be determined is how far culpability went up the chain of command.Ireland has only been independent for the last 80 years and can, therefore, be regarded as one of the relatively new states. We can be proud of our record in this area and should not be slow about saying so. Other more long established independent states would not have the same record.The United States, a very close ally of Ireland, has been quick to distance itself from accepting its obligations under some international agreements. While it has rightly been to the forefront in prosecuting war crimes, it has attempted to ensure it will never be the defendant in such situations. That is not an acceptable or tenable position. Given that America is such an important influence in the world – economically, politically, socially and every other way – it is important that it should be to the forefront of moves for better accountability for all actions by states in times of peace and war.The Minister's proposal that the Constitution will, as of right, take precedence over the convention has not found favour with all. There is no need for concern about this. I am ad idem with the Minister when he states the likelihood of a declaration of incompatibility is slight. In view of this, section 5 contains a good provision because should there be such a declaration, the Bill provides that the Oireachtas will be put on notice. The Members and responsible committees will debate the issue, which will lead to the Government being held accountable for the action, if any, to be taken to rectify any conflict that may arise.The provision dealing with compensation is prudent. It allows the injured party to apply to the Government for compensation by way of an ex gratia payment. I presume that the transparency which now exists in Government will mean that, in those circumstances, it will be known if there is cause for grievance and it will be highlighted in the Houses of the Oireachtas. We should have sufficient confidence in ourselves, as legislators, to be able to deal with these issues in a way which satisfies the rights of the appellant and society.The Bill raises certain questions. Section 6 provides that the Attorney General may appear in court and the Minister stated that there may be some provision to allow the Human Rights Commission to involve itself. I wonder if the provision cuts across prosecuting and defending counsel in some way. Given the cost, if I was to take a case to the High Court or Supreme Court, I am not sure I would welcome the imposition of a third party of whose line I was unsure. By virtue of this party's position, they would be an influential advocate whose arguments judges would not lightly disregard. This provision may represent an unnecessary interference in the process. I am sure that the Minister will comment on that matter later.Senator Terry referred to accessibility to law which, if not directly related to this legislation, is germane. The cost involved deters people from exercising their rights. I was pleased by the Minister's recent comment on the costs of tribunals, which are outlandish. As a legislator who supported the establishment of certain tribunals, I am now examining my conscience and asking if I was right to do so. I know that a certain good flows from them and that the State has received considerable revenue, but there must be more cost-effective ways of finding the truth than through the aggrandisement of lawyers.Ultimately, the law should be accessible by all the citizens of a republic, but exorbitant costs are a deterrent. In the context of the Bill, exorbitant costs might deter people who wish to exercise their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Separate to this matter, the Minister should examine ways in which to inject competition into a profession which is responsible for competition law.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I welcome the legislation, although I feel it is inadequate in some ways. There has been a sense of disappointment that this legislation was not brought forward earlier. That is why I am glad it is before the House today. The Minister is very lucky because he has had two bites at this cherry – first, as Attorney General, and, second, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It must be quite something to be both parents of a Bill.I am glad that the Minister pointed out how rare it has been for cases to be judged in Europe as meriting the benefits of the Convention on Human Rights. The Minister is quite right to say that our Constitution provides great human rights protections. In view of the fact that we are such a litigious group, ten cases in 50 years is quite incredible. The phrase "we will have to go to Europe" is one I have often heard and I would love to know if the Minister's official can tell him how many cases were brought before the court in Strasbourg. The failure rate must be very high indeed.The Minister pointed out that this legislation comes into effect in association with the promise we made in the Good Friday Agreement. It is important that we try to follow UK law as closely as possible, which is why I am slightly disappointed that the Minister has not made provision to apply the legislation to all courts. In the United Kingdom, the European Convention on Human Rights applies down to the magistrate courts. While the Minister has explained that most cases brought will be dealt with by higher courts, I do not understand why the provisions of the Bill will not apply all the way down to the District Court.The Minister's explanation that this legislation is not being introduced directly as Irish law is interesting. The President of the Human Rights Commission, Donal Barrington, favoured the 1991 approach to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction, which was brought into Irish law in toto. If that was acceptable then, I do not understand why it is not acceptable now.The European Convention on Human Rights has been extraordinarily important to all of us as overarching legislation to which we can appeal despite our fine Constitution. We have been involved with the convention since its inception. The cases which have been particularly important are those the Minister discussed involving sexual and family affairs, but it is important to remember that it was our Constitution which permitted the legalisation of contraception through the McGee case. We were not totally coming from behind the wall in terms of these cases. The Airey case was one of the most important of its kind for Irish women because it introduced free legal aid in civil cases. The latter had constituted an area of great difficulty previously.The aim of the European Convention on Human Rights is to vindicate the rights of the individual, but I do not see that reflected in this legislation on too many occasions. Reference is more often made to the State's obligations under the convention, which is not quite the same as vindicating an individual's rights.I am also concerned about the use of the phrase "as far as possible". I realise that the convention has always recognised that there may be economic problems in some countries which make it impossible to create the conditions which exist elsewhere. For example, the convention might accept conditions in Greek prisons which would not be acceptable in French prisons. However, I wish we were not using the phrase "as far as possible" because it might really mean the convention will be applied as far as the Government is agreeable.My main concern relates to the lack of remedies provided for in the Bill, particularly for the mentally ill, prisoners and children. One of the most important provisions of the convention is Article 13, which states that there must be a right to an effective remedy. Everyone whose rights and freedoms set forth in this convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity. I became even more concerned when I read a paper presented to the Law Society of Ireland in October 2002 by Anna Austin, a lawyer in the Registry of the Court of Human Rights, which states:In addition, in so far as complaints made in Irish courts under Article 13 and other substantive Articles about a lack of an effective domestic remedy for a violation of a convention right are not already answered by the current domestic system, the remedies contained in the 2001 Bill would not appear to fill the gap.That is an extremely important point. In other words, we are introducing legislation which we already know, and have been told by a very important member of the Court of Human Rights, will not fill the gap. It is not satisfactory. The only remedy offered in this Bill is financial compensation, which will be decided upon at the discretion of the Attorney General, the Government and their adviser. I presume the Government will appoint the adviser. That is not good enough. The adviser, the Government and the Attorney General will be on one side, with the unfortunate person seeking compensation on the other. Money is often an inadequate remedy in any event.As Senator Terry pointed out, discretionary remedies are against Strasbourg law. Ms Austin's paper also states:I would note here that, given the need under section 5 to establish that no other legal remedy is adequate and available, it is likely that that applicant will have also obtained a finding of constitutionality prior to the declaration of incompatibility. Accordingly, the non-obligatory nature of the declaration of incompatibility, the ex gratia nature of any damages received (whether or not substantial) and, importantly, the recognition that the impugned domestic provision was constitutional, are likely to be considered equivocal and ambiguous acknowledgements by the State of a breach of the Convention. As such a successful section 5 application would not prevent an individual from continuing to claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention in Strasbourg.I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply. Since there are no other remedies other than an ex gratia payment, people will believe they must go to Strasbourg where the case load is already enormous and likely to get larger.Article 3 of the convention, which deals with the prohibition of torture, is extremely important. It provides that nobody shall be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Ireland is frequently in dire trouble when committees from the Council of Europe on the prevention of cruel and inhumane treatment and torture visit this country and, particularly, the Central Mental Hospital and our prisons. In October 2002 Ireland was heavily criticised for the state of the Central Mental Hospital but people in the hospital will have no remedy with this legislation. What good is financial compensation to them? They are incarcerated in this institution and our mental health laws will do nothing to help them get out. Furthermore, there is nothing in this legislation to insist that the conditions there are improved.The second Maastricht convention specifies that there are conditions under which we can default from rectifying conditions but this relates to matters like earthquakes and we cannot claim to be in that position. This legislation will bring no remedy for the people concerned. Nothing in it will assist their human rights. As it is already recognised that there is a lack of resources for implementing the mental health Bill, it will not help them. The criminal insanity Bill appears to be stalled and there is nothing in it to assist them either. Furthermore, where is the rules of prison Bill? I read the Committee Stage debate on the Bill in which a Government Deputy stated Ireland had constantly taken an interest in the rights of Irish prisoners in British prisons. I wish people would take more interest in the rights of Irish prisoners in Irish prisons.The interim human rights commission, when it was chaired by Judge Donal Barrington, in a submission to the joint Oireachtas committee in June 2002 stated: "We would have preferred a more robust and effective form of incorporation; indeed, strictly speaking the Bill does not propose actually to incorporate the convention into Irish law, only to give it more effect here". How useful will that be for Irish children? If an organ of the State injures children, how will the Bill help them when the only remedy is money? How will the legislation help the children Judge Peter Kelly constantly talks about in his court? It was interesting that the Minister mentioned the last case found against Ireland, which involved a disturbed adolescent and the inadequacy of the remedies for that child. Ireland was pretty badly judged in that case and I see nothing in this legislation to help in that regard.Article 13 of the convention states there should be a right to an effective remedy. This is not provided for in the Bill. Article 34 states individual applications are possible but that is not being helped either. Article 41 of the convention states people should get "just satisfaction". In Schedule 2 there is provision for the right to education but I do not see where there will be a remedy for children in that regard under this legislation.When I was a child, I read the book "Heidi", one of the moral tales children were given in those days. In the book the grandfather in the Swiss Alps sent the child out to gather wild strawberries for him. He was ill and wanted to eat the strawberries. The child gathered the strawberries but then got involved in commerce. She sold the strawberries. When she returned to the grandfather with the money, he bit into it and asked how he could be expected to eat it. Money is not always a remedy or what people want. I do not see remedies for those in vulnerable situations under this legislation.The Bar Council and the Law Society have written about this and a submission made by the interim human rights commission, under the chairmanship of Judge Barrington, was most concerned about the lack of remedies. While I welcome this legislation, I have already tabled amendments to it because there are not enough remedies. One example is the right to education. The convention provides that no person "shall be denied the right to education". There have already been a number of cases in this regard before the courts which have found against the State. The article states: "In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions". These issues are extremely important.The article dealing with individual applications states:The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.However, the remedy of money might not be much good in that case. The article on just satisfaction states: "If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party". This again recognises that a monetary remedy may not be what is needed. I regret that the Bill does not make provision for this.

#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I welcome this important Bill, the purpose of which is to give effect in Irish law to the provisions of the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, more generally known as the Convention on Human Rights. The convention protects what are seen as basic civil and political rights in a democratic state. They are the rights to life, freedom of speech, freedom from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the right to freedom from slavery or forced and compulsory labour. There are many other basic rights which the people of this nation have enjoyed throughout our lives by virtue of the fact that we have been protected by the good Constitution our forefathers had the foresight to frame.This legislation will lay the foundation for ensuring atrocities and dictatorships will become things of the past. One does not have to look far to see evidence of dreadful atrocities close to the European Union. They include the degrading and inhuman treatment of people in places such as Serbia and Iraq, which demonstrates the need for legislation such as this.I have no doubt that when this Bill goes through the House and its provisions are enacted throughout the European Union, the laws will then be in place to deal with the perpetrators of such actions should they ever come to pass.As a nation, it appears that we are quite well placed to meet our obligations under the convention by virtue of having a formal Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution. It is acknowledged that Ireland is unique among member states of the European Union and other signatory states to the convention in having a written constitution which embodies a system of fundamental rights chosen by the people and which can only be changed by the will of the people. Our excellent human rights record before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is due in no small way to these factors.It could be said to be somewhat appropriate, given the prominence of the ongoing major challenges facing the peace process in Northern Ireland, that we are deliberating on the European Convention on Human Rights at this time. It was precisely on the basis of our commitments in the Good Friday Agreement that the Government decided to bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in the State by drawing on the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. In some ways it is a matching, reciprocal Bill that mirrors the 1998 Human Rights Act of the United Kingdom, which took full effect in October 2000 and has special significance for Northern Ireland.The Government, having considered the matter at great length and, I imagine, great depth, wisely decided to adopt a similar approach and legislate to give further effect to the convention here. It was a very wise decision. The convention, however, goes further than the 1998 Human Rights Act of the United Kingdom and takes into account four additional operational protocols. The 1952 Protocol deals with property, education and electoral rights. Protocol No. 4 prohibits imprisonment for inability to pay a debt and individual or collective expulsion of nationals. Protocol No. 6, as we know, deals with the abolition of the death penalty while Protocol No. 7 contains procedural safeguards concerning the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens, the right of appeal in criminal matters, compensation for wrongful conviction, the right not to be punished twice for the same offence and equality between spouses.All of these protocols deal with issues of great individual, public and national importance. There are reasonable grounds for believing Protocols Nos. 4 and 7 are extremely germane to the whole series of complex issues which still remain around citizenship in this country. These include issues such as whether the expulsion of a parental figure without Irish citizenship is a de facto expulsion of the child who has citizenship; and whether resident aliens entering or intending to enter into a meaningful relationship with an Irish citizen have protection from expulsion and wrongful conviction or otherwise.We have noted on other occasions the inappropriateness of sending senior citizens to jail for the non-payment of debt. It is almost always wrong to do such a thing and I am delighted that the provision within Protocol No. 4 will deal with this. We also still have anomalies in our law relating to those who may serve a sentence for the non-payment of a debt. They may go to jail for the non-payment of that debt and still be prosecuted for non-payment after they come out. They may even be sent back to prison a second time. That is a serious anomaly.The provisions in the Bill will alter the current position fundamentally because they will facilitate the bringing of cases concerning alleged breaches of rights under the convention before Irish courts. We fully accept that from here on we will have two complementary systems in place in Ireland for the protection of fundamental human rights. As the Minister said, the superior rules under the Constitution will take precedence. That is right and proper. The Bill of Rights under the convention will be enforceable in Irish courts, which will speed up the mechanism through which people are prosecuted in this way. This is to be welcomed.I welcome the provisions of the Bill and congratulate the Government on bringing them forward. It marks a decisive shift in favour of the citizen.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I thank Senator Kett for sharing his time with me. We can be proud in this House of the role which Ireland has played on the international stage in the whole area of human rights. It is worth noting that the provisions of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms were formally ratified by Ireland as far back as 1953, some 50 years ago. It is also worth pointing out that some of our European neighbours have only recently accepted the all-important right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The brutality of the Second World War and horrors of the Holocaust profoundly impacted on those who framed the convention. Watching the RTE "Leargas" programme last night from Bosnia, part of the former Yugoslavia, refreshed my mind to the awfulness of the conflict that took place there. Today, more than ever, we should remember this. It should be first and foremost in all our minds.We all know that the current situation in Ireland is such that arguments based on convention rights, if they can be raised at all before domestic courts, are not of persuasive effect under Irish law. The situation requires that a person wishing to vindicate a right under the convention must first exhaust all possible remedies under Irish law before going to plead his or her case before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This is most unsatisfactory. It is for this reason that I welcome the provisions of the Bill which will provide for the bringing of cases involving alleged breaches of rights under the convention before the Irish courts. This is a welcome development for Irish citizens who previously had to exhaust very lengthy and expensive avenues to have their cases heard here first, before going to the European Court of Human Rights.I know I have very little time but I wish, in the time I have left, to highlight the plight of men who find themselves precluded from visiting their children, or who even find themselves unsuccessful in gaining access to their children. Last weekend I heard on radio of an event held to coincide with Father's Day. It was a silent protest in Dublin held to draw attention to this very issue. This is one of the most important aspects of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It will allow such men to go forward and have their cases heard. It is individuals such as the men who protested last weekend who will get great solace and achieve so much out of the Bill.I previously omitted to welcome the Minister of State. I say, "Well done" to him and the Government for bringing the Bill before us.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The European Convention on Human Rights is a most extraordinary achievement, not because it contains the wonderful, highfalutin language of, say, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights but because, within limited legal frameworks, it confers extra-territorial enforcement rights on a court independent of the judiciaries and executives of individual states. It was extraordinary 50 years ago – when concepts of sovereignty were even stronger than they are now – that a group of European states said that, within a limited brief, they would allow their citizens to appeal against the actions of a state to a court which was outside the state and independent of its law and constitution. Like many of the seminal ideas about the European Union, it was visionary and the irony, as others have said, is that had it not been for the horrors of the Second World War, governments would probably never have assembled the political will to set up the European Court of Human Rights. Similarly, but for the Second World War the process of Europe coming together perhaps would never have begun. The convention was an extraordinary and historic idea because it conferred rights on citizens vis-à-vis their own state, enabling them to appeal against its actions and binding the state, except under certain limited circumstances, to respect and implement the outcome.I agree with the Minister – I have said this on many occasions – that the 1937 Constitution, contrary to much of the superficial liberal analysis of it, is a robust defence of human rights. In many instances, this probably is not worthy of the term "analysis" because people have picked up quaint phrases that characterise the time at which it was written. One has to remember that it was being drawn up when democracy was profoundly unfashionable all over Europe on both the left and the right and within the institution which dominated the ideology of this State, namely, the Roman Catholic Church, which was not keen on it and was quite impressed by many aspects of the so-called corporate state. The wording used in the constitution replicates many of the phrases used in the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly those relating to freedom of speech. The incorporation of the explicit right to criticise the Government sounds quaint, but in the Europe of 1937 it was anything but quaint. There were few countries then – and even fewer two years later – where one, without the risk of being shot – not to mention the risk of being prosecuted – could criticise government.The 1937 Constitution is usually waved away by liberals as de Valera's constitution, but it is a remarkable document. I would not like the current system of public administration to be given the job of rewriting it because many of the rights that have been developed and interpreted from it could well be heavily qualified. I am certain that the constitutional right to primary education would be diluted because the fashion is to say that the incorporation of social rights into the Constitution is bad. The Supreme Court has taken a view on aspects of this matter which indicates that it is fashionable in the judicial as well as the political process to make such suggestions.I have no great difficulty with the 1937 Constitution. It contains some quaint language, particularly in the area of women's rights. The most explicitly quaint statement in the Constitution appears in Article 41.2: "The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home." I would be the last person to require any woman to work inside the home, but it is a pity that the constitutional assertion that a woman should not be obliged to work outside the home was not tested. It would do a great deal for women's rights if the right to make a choice was vindicated under the Constitution. Nevertheless, I am an admirer of the Constitution.The more time I spend in the House, the more I become convinced that specialists should never be let loose in Government Departments. Like the rest of us, the laity can, though perhaps only to a small degree, be overwhelmed.I have a series of questions about the Bill. I understood that the Good Friday Agreement was an agreement by the State to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. Manifestly, we have not done that. Nobody is going to argue about that. It is not an incorporation, it is a smoothing and simplifying of the process and many of its elements are a significant improvement on what existed heretofore. For example, it is a huge improvement not to have to undergo the tortuous and expensive procedures that Senator Norris was obliged to go through in that area. It is also a major improvement on what my late friend, Josie Airey, had to go through to vindicate her rights. One hopes that – in contrast to the position 30 or 40 years ago – these things would not be necessary in our somewhat more responsive democracy because the Oireachtas would respond. Nevertheless, while it is a welcome simplification, it is not an incorporation.One issue the Minister did not address – the failure to incorporate it into law leaves matters hanging – is what will happen if a right identified under the European Convention on Human Rights is in conflict with a right enumerated in the Constitution? While I do not wish to re-open the issue of amendments to the Constitution to deal with the right to life of the unborn, many judicial interpretations have given women legal rights in the area of abortion, based on privacy, and the convention contains a section on the right to privacy. What will happen if there is a conflict between the right of the unborn in the Constitution and the right as interpreted under the European Convention on Human Rights? I would have thought that we would be obliged to clarify that matter.The Minister said that the possibilities of conflict were few. He used a wonderful phrase about this being "asymptotic" towards zero. I did not think lawyers knew enough about mathematics to be able to put such a phrase together, but it just shows that, if they are obliged to, lawyers can manage most things. There is a possibility of fundamental conflict, in this instance, between the convention and our Constitution.The Minister made a fascinating contribution, particularly the additional information he offered and his eulogy of de Valera's Constitution. Given the Minister's family origins, the latter was extremely interesting. However, his responses to questions about whether it could be incorporated into law or into the Constitution were among the weakest part of his contribution. He relied heavily on the 1996 review, which was profoundly conservative in nature and which, for example, took a very hard line on the incorporation of social rights into the Constitution.The review group's hostility to the incorporation of social rights was so explicit that one is led to believe that, had it been given a choice, it would have eliminated the one undoubted social right, namely, the right to a primary education – from the Constitution because there is no reason that this particular right should be the only one. Why should the right to which I refer not include secondary education? Why should there not be a basic right to shelter or to an adequate income on which to live? Why are those different? Why is my right to own property protected in the Constitution, but not my right to shelter? Why is my right to property superior to my right to shelter? We know the answer to that and it revolves around who owns property and who needs shelter.In the 1930s, in particular, that would have been especially difficult, which is not to malign the Constitution, which, as I have often said, is a fine document and has been extremely robust. The way the Judiciary has used it, too, has been extremely robust. However, the Minister's arguments about the law and the Constitution are the weakest in his very erudite and interesting speech which many law students will read with great interest. When he speaks of the incorporation of the convention into the Constitution, he quotes the review group saying as it "might lead to new gaps in protection in fundamentally important areas, such as the rights to trial by jury."The convention is a very important document but it is not the only statement of rights. The right to trial by jury could just as easily be incorporated into the Constitution in addition to the convention without any great problem. It would not be beyond the collective wisdom of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the parliamentary counsel to incorporate the convention into the Constitution while simultaneously identifying and protecting any rights that the Constitution gives our citizens in addition to those in the convention.We have already done this to a degree, regardless of my views, on the issue of the right to life of the unborn, which is manifestly not covered by the convention. If we can do it on one issue, I cannot see the reason we cannot do so on many others. The idea that there could potentially be conflict is weak and has to do more with a conservative view of where the convention should be in our legal structure than with logic or any compelling argument. Then there is the argument about making the convention part of the law of the State. The Minister said:The fatal flaw with such an approach is that it would have the capacity to undermine one of the central pillars of the Constitution, namely, the doctrine of the separation of powers. It would mean that the Oireachtas was investing the Judiciary with a new right to invalidate the laws of the Oireachtas by reference to what was decided by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In effect, the judges would become law-makers implementing decisions of that court contrary to the exclusive role of the Oireachtas.The Judiciary became law-makers a long time ago in that regard, mostly where the Oireachtas declined to do its duty, particularly in a number of cases, of which we know in the area of education, and especially in the right to privacy in the McGee contraception case and a number of other such areas where the courts have essentially made law. Their interpretation of the first so-called "right to life" amendment to the Constitution was a clear example of the Judiciary making law because the Oireachtas had failed to do its duty. If the convention was incorporated into law, it would be the job of the Oireachtas to ensure there were no conflicts between it and existing law or, where they became evident, to deal with them or provide a process for doing so, in which case the alleged fear would not arise. The second argument about not incorporating the convention into law is, first, flawed and, second, inconsistent with the history of previous Supreme Courts.I am well aware that the current Supreme Court has essentially been campaigning to roll back that role of the Judiciary, notably in the Synott case, but in some others, too. However, the fact that the court takes the view and that it is fashionable – I know one eminent legal academic in Cork who is also a good friend who takes a similar view – cannot disguise that what we are doing here is not precisely what we said we would do. We are not incorporating the convention into Irish law.It seems that we needed to be courageous but that we were not. We needed to take either the legal or the constitutional route, perhaps both, and declined to do so. We have improved the process but not the rights. As several speakers have said, we have left very limited remedies. I am also disappointed at the ungenerous limit of one year's retrospection provided for in the Bill. I would have thought that at least three years would have been a reasonably generous compromise. One year is about as short as one could get away with without being accused of trivialising matters. That is disappointing. The Bill is welcome as far as it goes but does not do what we should have done. For that reason, I must record my disappointment.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I welcome the Minister of State and greet what I consider major legislation. The European Convention on Human Rights is a radical document. We must remember this when charges of conservatism are made. Ireland has a very good record, as detailed by the Minister, regarding the convention, in particular, in allowing the right of individual appeal from the beginning. My colleague, Senator Feeney, in her very short contribution, put her finger on the Bill's essence. I paraphrase her words. It incorporates directly into Irish jurisprudence – though perhaps not the courts or the Constitution – the Convention on Human Rights in order that, when cases are considered, sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, in particular, will require the systematic interpretation of cases in the light of the State's obligations under the convention. The same goes for the organs of State. That is, in anyone's terms, a major advance.It was a privilege to be here during the Minister's speech. All of us who know him or have listened to him will know that he has given a tremendous amount of thought and care to this subject and that he is tremendously exercised in a creative way by the tensions between and compatibility of European conventions and law and Irish law. What he is doing is in keeping with the wishes of the people. I had to address a forum on Europe a few nights ago in Sligo. One of the matters about which people are concerned right across the board is alleged loss of sovereignty. One can argue, as I did, that very often sharing sovereignty means enhancing rather than losing it. The care evident in this approach protects our sovereignty in order that when a breach is determined or identified, the Government and the Legislature will decide how it is to be repaired. I do not have the same fears as expressed by some speakers on the other side of the House to the extent that it means that the Government or Legislature might do nothing or something minimalist. This country has been a good international citizen, and if we inadvertently discover that we are in breach of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights – it has happened rarely – our record is that we try to repair that breach fully.This legislation is obviously a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement. Obviously, there is asymmetry between the legal and constitutional situations north and south of the Border. What we signed up to in the Agreement was carefully expressed. It did not state directly that we would incorporate this but that the Government would take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction and bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. The Agreement went on to state that those proposals would draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other instruments and that the question of the incorporation of the convention would be further examined in that context, with the aim of ensuring at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as that pertaining in Northern Ireland.In general, protection of human rights in this jurisdiction has been far ahead of that in Northern Ireland. This is not merely a parliamentary democracy but a constitutional democracy. I have been following with some interest recent political manoeuvres across the water about the existence of the Lord Chancellor and the Law Lords interfering with the separation of powers.It has been gratifying to hear the Constitution being vindicated on all sides of the House. De Valera was its prime mover but we should also remember the very able team of legal advisers he had, including John Hearne and others. Obviously, it was a collective effort by some of the finest legal minds among the pioneers of the State.I know the Minister is worried at times by the relationship between common law and Roman law and so on. I do not necessarily always go along completely with him on the total superiority of the systems of law we have on these islands over those on the Continent but obviously the European Convention on Human Rights and the way it is implemented blend our law with European rights and traditions. There is much that is positive in European legal traditions and I have no particular queasiness about them. There are negatives involved but there have been negatives in our case also; the system of human rights protection we had, which we have praised all morning, unfortunately did not prevent serious cases of child abuse in previous decades. We need to keep our perspective and improving the position.While there is a high level of compatibility between the Constitution and the convention, and with the European Charter which has come from the work on the draft convention, we should not take the view that these have nothing to add. In many ways they express things in different ways or more directly. I am happy we are to have both – the best in the combined tradition of the Continent, to which we belong, and the best of what we have developed. It is not one above the other but the parallels can be made compatible and consistent to the maximum extent.In general, the Constitution covered economic and social rights but made them mostly non-justiciable – the directive principles of social policy. Beyond very general statements I would hesitate to transfer responsibility for what ought to be done by Government and Parliament to the courts. It is a job for the Government elected by the people to solve housing problems, health problems and so on. We should not remit all of this, faute de mieux in the eyes of the proponents of that idea, to the Supreme Court to settle.I fully accept Senator Henry's comments on the need to further improve prison facilities and the Central Mental Hospital. We have put a lot of investment into new prison facilities, some of which I have visited. While they are very good, obviously it does not pervade through the system. We need more.I am very happy with this important act of completion. The Minister has found a way to deal with this which will enter the legal and political history books, on which I congratulate him.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The background to the Bill is quite clear. Ireland is one of the ten founding signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights. As we had the first case, the Lawless case, to be heard in Strasbourg, we have had a long period of involvement. However, I can only give the most guarded welcome to the Bill, as it is quite clear it takes a minimalist approach. We are doing the least amount possible in the circumstances. This is not at all adventurous and flies in the face of the best legal opinion in the country, including that of the Human Rights Commission which advised strongly on a different option. We have worked ourselves into a complete nonsense in some sections of the Bill where we have provided for a situation where a citizen can go to a domestic court in Ireland for a declaration that the impugned section of the law or behaviour contradicts the European Convention on Human Rights but remains compatible with the Constitution; despite the damage done to that individual's rights, he or she has no remedy. That is extraordinary. We are placing the court in the invidious situation where it will find a violation of fundamental human rights but there is nothing it can do about it. It can rely on an ex gratia payment from the Attorney General and perhaps resort to the European Court in Strasbourg again.I have a review by the Human Rights Commission of this matter which quotes the old Latin tag, ubi ius ibi remedium– where there is a right, there is a remedy. That is a basic principle not only of international law but also of the Constitution, Article 40.3 of which states:1º The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.2º The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.The State is not doing this. The legislation provides citizens with a certificate stating their rights are being violated and virtually nothing can be done about it. This flies in the face of the Constitution. The Human Rights Commission states it is unacceptable to place the courts in a position where they can identify a breach of human rights and not be in a position to give an effective remedy.I speak with some feeling on this because I am in the unique position of being the only Member of the Oireachtas who has used all these mechanisms. I know we had to exhaust domestic remedies and then go to Europe but in the earliest cases heard in court in Dublin my legal team argued the question of the European Convention on Human Rights and its application here, suggesting it should at least be taken into account. During that case a decision was handed down in an identical case in Strasbourg. However, judges in this country found against me. Something, therefore, that had been identified as a breach of human rights under a major international instrument was found compatible with our Constitution. In addition, I, as a citizen, was debarred from introducing arguments under the European Convention on Human Rights because it was not incorporated into Irish law.I regret that this legislation is only being introduced because of two factors, the first of which is embarrassment at our inglorious isolation in Europe as the only one of the 43 subscribing states which has not incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights since Norway incorporated it in 1999. There was a kind of disgraceful isolation in Europe. The second factor is the Good Friday Agreement which, more or less, put the real pressure on us politically.We found ourselves under pressure to which we are reacting. We were told by Professor William Binchy in his submission to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 18 December 2002 that there are three ways – two good and one that is not so good – to deal with this matter. We have gone for the way which is not so good. The first way is the full constitutional incorporation by referendum, which is complicated, difficult and could backfire. The second is full incorporation, for which most countries – but not Ireland – have opted.I attended a lecture by an individual with distinguished legal mind, Donncha O'Connell, who is a lecturer in law in the National University of Ireland, Galway, on 26 November last year on this attempt at incorporation. He called it clever and elegant or too clever by half. One can guess on which side he comes down. He said that we take the worst of the options and we do what is done when we feel particularly intellectually lazy, namely, we look to see what the United Kingdom has done. He calls it the Delia Smith factor in that we reach down and say "Here is one I prepared earlier". That is what we have done, despite the fact, as Senator Mansergh pointed out in his interesting contribution, that this is not really primarily a parliamentary democracy. This is much more a constitutional democracy.The United Kingdom Government chose this particular minimalist approach is because it was concerned about the primacy of Westminster and Parliament and about the separation of powers, all issues which have been dealt with in some technical detail by the Human Rights Commission and dismissed. Despite the fact this is, as Senator Mansergh correctly stated, a constitutional democracy, the Government has taken down a model which – by virtue of the definition the Senator provided – is less applicable to and appropriate for this jurisdiction. That is a cause for concern.The Irish Council for Civil Liberties strongly promoted the full incorporation of the convention into domestic law by legislation and provided a list of reasons for so doing. It would allow Irish citizens and all those under Irish jurisdiction to have full access to their convention rights and to seek vindication of such rights before domestic authorities without having to undertake an often long and costly case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. One could go take a shortcut and go directly to Europe, instead of having to go through the High Court, the Supreme Court and then to Strasbourg. It would be a kind of one-stop-shop.I remind the House that it is an extremely expensive undertaking to get a case as far as Strasbourg, where there is always the possibility one may lose and that costs may be awarded against one in the domestic courts. The latter happened to me in the High Court, although the decision was reversed by the Supreme Court as it was determined to be a matter of constitutional importance. There is always this aspect of expense.Somebody used a lovely phrase about the crux of this Bill being the extent to which we wanted to determine issues of justice in our courts or export them to Strasbourg. If there was full incorporation, there would be far less traffic to Strasbourg and we would be able to handle our affairs here far more adequately and consistently. That is another argument in favour of full legislative incorporation.Incorporation of the convention would also bring Ireland into line with standards of human rights in the United Kingdom and in the North of Ireland, so it would satisfy the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement. It would also support and underpin existing constitutional rights protection and help to bring about an equivalence of protection of human rights in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. The common understanding of rights and a unified approach is an important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. At a minimum, in terms of a legislative incorporation, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties believes that the Bill should provide that the convention should have the force of law within the State, notwithstanding any contrary provisions of any other statute. I understand that this is what has been done in Sweden and I see no reason that it should not be done here.I return to the question of relief. It seems quite extraordinary that one cannot get proper relief. The question of compensation will be left to the discretion of the Attorney General. That is completely wrong.I also received a brief from the Children's Rights Alliance. Again, it comes down very much against the method of incorporation the Government has chosen because it is minimalist. The alliance is looking for the legislation to be amended so that there is full incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights. I understand that some amendments have been tabled. I received some amendments from the Law Society which I have put down. My colleagues, Senator Terry and Senator Henry, have probably received similar correspondence because I notice many of the amendments are virtually identical.In political terms, the House is supposed to be act as a revising mechanism and as an instrument for refining legislation in order to make it more efficient and friendly to the citizen. The manner in which the Government takes these amendments on board will, therefore, be a test of the way it regards this House because serious and constructive amendments have been put down which will resolve the idiotic situations where there is a declaration that something is wrong, or that a wrong has been committed against a citizen, but where there is no proper recourse or remedy.I wish to refer to another point which has been raised with me on that matter. If, for example, somebody is sentenced to a term of imprisonment under a law which has been found to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, what recourse is there for the appellant? This is a practical and serious matter in that somebody could be jailed, which could have happened to me. Under the previous Acts, which I managed to impugn successfully in Strasbourg, I could have been sent to jail in this jurisdiction despite the fact that these laws had already been identified as a serious breach of human rights. Under this legislation, if this happens in the future to another citizen, he or she will have no remedy in that the only remedy of any use would be to obtain an order from the court for release of the prisoner. That is another classic example of the tantalising situation where a wrong has been determined against a citizen but no proper remedy has been found for the appellant by the State.I regard this legislation as a rather grudging move in the right direction. Quite a number of anomalies and difficulties have already been identified in it. The apparent exclusion of teaching institutions, particularly those controlled by the Church, under the definition of "organ of the State" is regrettable. Senator Mansergh referred to the fact that it had proved impossible, even under our admittedly good Constitution, to protect the rights of people who were in these State institutions. Having acknowledged that, we are enacting a Bill which will make matters even more difficult and under which these people will not have any rights because the bodies which offended against them in the first instance will, apparently, be excluded from its provisions.While I welcome anything that moves in the direction of human rights and their greater acknowledgement by the Legislature, I regret that the overwheming advice given to the Government from all bodies, including the Human Rights Commission that it established, has not been taken on board. We have gone for the minimalist approach that has landed us in a series of legislative contradictions. The former distinguished Member of this House, Dr. Maurice Manning, chairman of the Human Rights Commission, said: "We felt then that a more robust approach would strengthen human rights here and would facilitate ordinary citizens". In other words, it also saw this as the least useful of all the options. To reiterate, Professor Binchy said there were three options: one good; one less good; and one absolutely not so good. For which one have we gone? We have gone for the least good of all the options in a slavish imitation of the United Kingdom Government which is operating in a different legal context.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I sincerely thank all Senators for their erudite contributions. I am sorry for only being here for the last hour of what was no doubt a very interesting debate in which very many interesting points were raised. I am sure Committee Stage will be very interesting.Senator Jim Walsh raised a point about the involvement of the Human Rights Commission. To clarify the position, the commission will have no automatic right to be heard in these or any other cases arising outside the Bill. A balance has to be struck between its role in advising the court and the court making a decision on whether the commission should be allowed to get involved on the facts of each case. What will happen is that the commission will be notified about the making of a possible declaration of incompatibility. It will then have the right to apply to the court on whether it should be heard. The court will have to weigh up a number of factors, the primary one being, as the Minister said, the paramount need to be fair to the parties concerned. That will be the extent of the commission's involvement.Senator Henry's references to the criticisms of the Bill, particularly section 5, were based on a reading of the section which was not correct. The position has been explained at length by the Minister in the interim and we can deal with the details on Committee Stage.To reply to Senator Ryan, the Good Friday Agreement obliges the Government to further examine the question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in the wider context of strengthening and protecting human rights. That is what was decided, as Senator Mansergh pointed out very clearly. That is what the Good Friday Agreement states. There was no reference to incorporation of the convention into the Constitution or domestic law per se. In any case incorporation has many meanings. I am advised that what is proposed in the Bill accords with the Oxford English Dictionary definition of the word “incorporation”. In a possible conflict between the Constitution and the convention the Constitution will prevail. As the Minister said, incorporation of the convention into the Constitution is neither necessary nor required. The outcome of any possible referendum on the issue, which we would have to have, cannot be predicted with any accuracy. I think Senator Mansergh also adverted to this—

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	74	—regarding the genuine concerns some have about sovereignty. We have to take their points of view into account.I always listen with great interest to Senator Norris but particularly on this occasion because he is, as he rightly pointed out, the only Member of the Oireachtas who has had the initiative and courage to take a case all the way to Strasbourg, on which I compliment him.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Unfortunately, the Senator's first reading or understanding of the Bill may have been slightly flawed. The position, as I understand it, is that, as matters stand, a litigant may go all the way to Strasbourg but all he or she will get there by way of compensation are damages. Looking back at the tradition of the awards given in Strasbourg, I understand the amounts are parsimonious.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I got nothing. Not one cent.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Indeed. As matters stand, when the Bill becomes law, if the State or any public body is found to be acting in a way which is in breach of the convention, the person concerned will be able to receive damages, not ex gratia but as of right, provided the action in respect of which he or she is getting damages also involves a breach of the Constitution. It is only where the Constitution has not been infringed that he or she will have to take the ex gratia route. Let me explain. The ex gratia route does not mean that a person will not be entitled to an award or will not get damages. Of course, he or she will but it has to be done this way because there is no provision in Irish law which enables a court to grant damages for something which is not in breach of the Constitution. As that is the reality, we are doing it this way. One will not have to go to court to receive this ex gratia award or to Strasbourg to determine quantum. It will simply be a matter of applying. The Attorney General and his staff will work out a formula to calculate damages. While I hope there will not be too many breaches, no doubt, unfortunately, there will be some. A set of precedents will be established and people will have a very good general idea of where they are going.

If one wants to take that route, it will still be available.On the question of appealing the amount, it is not appropriate to talk about appealing something declared to be  ex gratia but I will check that point for the Senator.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That is the problem.

I understand where he is coming from but, unfortunately, the people who submitted these proposals do not have a monopoly of wisdom. We have received an equal, if not greater, amount of representations from the other side. There is the continuing question of sovereignty. The Senator decried our decision to take the United Kingdom model but we are not accepting it in its totality – our model is much better. Sometimes even the British get it right. The Senator is suggesting we use the Swedish model but the British model has just as good a chance of being right as the Swedish one.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for the opportunity to introduce this Bill at short notice. As the House is aware, publication of the Bill was approved by the Government yesterday. The fact that we are discussing it here today is an indication of the priority the Government and this House attaches to its subject matter.I thank to the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for last Wednesday's discussion on the general scheme of the Bill. Having reflected on the outcome of those discussions, I have introduced a number of changes. I will mention these when I am dealing with the detailed provisions. Before entering into the detail, however, I wish to make a few general points.The Bill is an interim response to the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the first report of the strategic task force on alcohol, which was established by the Minister for Health and Children. The House will recall that the Commission on Liquor Licensing was established by the Government in late 2000 to review the liquor licensing system and to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes. By the time it had concluded its work at the end of March 2003, the commission had submitted four reports covering various aspects of the licensing laws and collectively containing over 130 recommendations.One of the commission's recommendations is a codification of the intoxicating liquor code which is currently spread across many statutes, some dating back to the early part of the 19th century. Such an exercise is long overdue. It will result in all law relating to the supply of intoxicating liquor in Ireland being found in one Act, which will be up-to-date, modern, readable and accessible. This exercise was first recommended in 1925. I have accepted that particular recommendation without hesitation. The preparatory work is already underway in my Department and I expect an outline of the Bill will be available by mid-2004.In the meantime, I have decided to bring forward the short Bill before the House in response to urgent recommendations of the commission. The proposals in the Bill are consistent with the recommendations set out in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol, which was published last year, and are also relevant in the context of the special initiative on tackling alcohol abuse set out in chapter 2 of the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.The Bill does not seek to encompass the wider structural reforms advocated by the commission in its reports. My intention is that these will be addressed in the codification Bill. There will be ample opportunity to discuss the contents of that legislation, including the response to all the commission's recommendations, next year. The codification Bill will also provide us with an opportunity to revisit the provisions set out in the current proposal. My hope is that the sense of urgency, which we all share, attaching to the proposals before us, will facilitate a speedy passage of the Bill through both Houses before the summer recess in the knowledge that we will revisit this business next year and will be able to address any imperfections that may emerge.The second point relates to the factors that have contributed to increased alcohol-related harm in recent years. When we look at the facts that have contributed to the increase in alcohol consumption – societal and demographic changes, changing lifestyles and expectations, more disposable income among young people in particular and a lessening of parental control on young people – we realise that the problem of alcohol harm is multidimensional and that simplistic solutions will not work.The State has an important role to play in addressing the problems associated with alcohol-related harm, but it must be combined with action at other levels. I refer here to local community action, action within the family – where values and parental example are crucial – and at individual level, where self-esteem and self-respect are all important. Senator Quinn spoke about this on a previous occasion and set out the four levels of action on this matter. I tend to agree with him and I have stolen his lines on a number of occasions.The proposals set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill form part of the State's response. Other actions are being considered by my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children and Transport, in the areas of advertising and road safety, respectively.When framing legislation in an area such as this, it is important to seek to strike an appropriate balance between potentially conflicting policy objectives and rights. It seems that we must respect the rights of the very many who drink alcohol in moderation, while protecting vulnerable groups, including young people and the families of those who abuse alcohol.We must have regard to the rights of the drinks industry and the licensed trade, while ensuring that practices that lead to excessive consumption of alcohol or that are exploitative are discouraged or prohibited. Risks to public order must be minimised, but not at the expense of basic rights and freedoms. I have been conscious of the need to strike such a balance in the proposals set out in the Bill.Some have criticised the Bill as doing too little, other have criticised it as doing far too much.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Then the Minister must be right.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	88	When one is attacked from all sides, it reassures one that one is not at either extreme of the pendulum.Section 1 contains the Short Title, collective citations and construction and commencement provisions. It is my intention to phase in the implementation of the Bill because some people will have a moral entitlement to decent notice before it comes into operation.Section 2 contains definitions. The definition of bar is taken from the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. That is an important definition because a distinction is made in sections of the Bill between licensed premises and the bar of licensed premises. For example, in respect of hotels, this is of crucial importance because underage persons age are entitled to be in an hotel in which they reside. They should not be in a position where they have to produce evidence of age cards to gain access to the hotel. On the other hand, if certain requirements are made in respect of the bars of hotels, it is a reasonable balance.Admission to the bar of licensed premises is prohibited in certain cases, but access to other parts of the premises – for example, a function room or a dining room or many public houses which serve food – is not affected. If a room is set aside which is not a bar, many of the provisions of the Bill will not apply to them.Some Members of the House will have heard Pat Kenny and me discussing the prospects of the Bill on radio recently. He mentioned certain pubs in the west which served families late at night. They will have time for rearrangements before the next tourist season and will be in a position to have special rooms where family parties can be served with food. The adults in the family party will be allowed to have alcohol with their food without infringing the terms of this legislation.This section also contains definitions of "drunken person"' and "disorderly conduct". Arising from last week's discussions with the joint committee, I have brought the definition of "drunken person" into line with section 4(1) of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. People were asking what constituted a drunken person and whether somebody who was tipsy, merry or whose speech was slurred was drunk. My answer was that District Court judges, confronted with cases where this was a relevant issue, would decide on a common sense basis and, in criminal cases, beyond all reasonable doubt. We have decided on a high threshold in regard to drunkenness. To be regarded as drunk, a person must be intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might endanger himself or herself, or any other person in the vicinity. In social terms, a person would need to be well drunk before these provisions would have effect.The broad definition of "disorderly conduct" takes account of the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Section 3 repeals a number of provisions being replaced in the Bill which I will mention as I move through the sections.In regard to conduct on licensed premises, the provisions set out in Part 2 of the Bill update the law. Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with drunken persons and drunkenness, while sections 7 and 8 deal with disorderly conduct. They update and replace provisions in the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act 1860 and the Licensing Act 1872, which have fallen into disuse largely because of the penalties provided for under them.Section 4 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons by licensees, as well as drunkenness in the bar of licensed premises. It provides that a licensee shall not admit a drunken person to the bar and that where a person is drunk on leaving licensed premises, it shall be presumed that he or she was drunk while on the premises until the contrary is proved.Section 5 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons in licensed premises by a person other than the licensee. In other words, a drunken person cannot send a sober person to the bar or rely on an intermediary to further the process of intoxication.Offences by drunken persons are set out in section 6 which provides that a drunken person shall leave licensed premises on being requested to do so by a garda. Moreover, such a person shall not seek re-entry to the bar of any licensed premises for a period of 24 hours. Access to a restaurant or other facilities within a hotel will not be affected. A Garda power of arrest is also included.Section 7 places a duty on licensees to preserve order on licensed premises, while section 8 prohibits disorderly conduct on such premises. A person engaging in disorderly conduct must leave the premises on being requested to do so by a licensee or member of the Garda and shall not re-enter the premises within a period of 24 hours. Again, a Garda power of arrest is included. The section also provides that a licensee may refuse admission to a person convicted of an offence under the section where such admission could reasonably be regarded as involving a substantial risk that the person would engage in disorderly conduct.The relevance of criminalising disorderly conduct and drunkenness is that no licensee can be held to infringe any law if he or she is defending his or her premises or person from admitting a drunken or disorderly person to the premises. The right of admission, implied generally by licensing law, to people of good behaviour is, to that extent, curtailed.Section 9 extends the temporary closure of premises penalty to include offences under several sections, including sections 4 and 7. While temporary closure of the premises will be mandatory in the event of conviction, the District Court will retain a margin of discretion with regard to the duration of the closure period. This penalty is confined under existing legislative provisions to convictions for under age drinking. The reason the mandatory penalty of closure for some period is being introduced is I want licensees and, above all, their staff to clearly understand they can say with safety to somebody on the premises that he or she has had enough to drink. Staff, in particular, will be able to say, "It is as good as my job is worth to serve you any more."In America people in charge of admission policies to bars are inflexible. They can explain to customers who query their decisions that they will be sacked if they serve them. I want it to be understood that this provision is not just a matter of paying a fine of a few euro in the District Court. A fundamental cornerstone of our licensing law will be that if a person is drunk to the extent provided in this Bill, to admit him or her to a premises or bring him or her to such a state in a premises will be a serious offence. This will strengthen the hand of licensees against those who plead with them for more alcohol when they are clearly drunk, within the meaning of the Bill.Other amendments of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts are included in Part 3, including, in particular, amendments relating to persons under the age of 18 years as set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. Section 10 provides that Thursday night closing time will revert to 11.30 p.m. instead of 12.30 a.m. The Commission on Liquor Licensing has recommended this change, which is also in line with the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol. At the recent joint committee meeting Deputy Deasy asked me to consider making this change for Fridays and Saturdays also. I have not received a recommendation from either of the expert bodies to that effect. Also, although I know he feels a mistake was made in the year 2000, this measure is enough for the moment. Next year, in the context of the consolidating and codifying legislation and a broad review of licensing law and policy, this issue can be revisited. We will then see whether there is public demand for the revisiting of the hours then in force.Section 11 replaces section 5 of the Act of 1927 which makes provision for the grant of special exemption orders. The section contains three changes. First, in subsection (7) it provides for a local authority a role in determining the duration of special exemption orders in its administrative area. The District Court will retain discretion in granting such orders but shall have regard to any resolution adopted by a local authority in the area in which the premises are located. The local authority, before it adopts such a resolution, must consult the Garda and consider views submitted by it and any other persons, including health interest groups, before adopting any such resolution.Second, the grounds on which objections to the grant of such orders may be made under subsection (6) are to be extended to include inconvenience or nuisance to persons residing in the locality, or an undue risk to public order in the locality. At present, the grounds are limited to "undue inconvenience to persons residing in the vicinity" of the licensed premises.Third, in the context of the District Court attaching conditions to the grant of special exemption orders, specific mention is now made of a possible requirement to install a closed circuit television system. This will not be the case in every premises.Section 12 prohibits the provision of entertainment during the 30 minutes drinking-up period permitted under existing provisions. Some Senators are not as expert as others on licensing law at closing times and some have never been in licensed premises when these hours have been reached. For that large majority in this House I explain that 12.30 a.m. is the latest closing time for ordinary pubs on a Friday night. However, with a special exemption a pub can trade until 2.30 a.m. In many cases, people are entitled to buy drink up to 2.30 a.m. and to continue drinking until 3 a.m. This effectively means that the dancing and drinking goes on until 3 a.m. This section provides that drinking-up time is also cooling-down time and that entertainment, in particular dancing, comes to an end at 2.30 a.m. in order that everyone will be nursing the remainder of their drinks and getting their coats to go home at that hour. I know that the House will welcome such a provision.The Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended this change in order to ensure that the original purpose of allowing an orderly clearing of licensed premises is not defeated. It is ridiculous to have drinking-up time when people are on the dance floor.Section 13 substitutes a new section for section 32 of the 1988 Act. It prohibits the purchase of alcohol for or its delivery to persons under the age of 18. However, the purchase or delivery of intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under 18 in a private residence where a parent or guardian has given explicit consent shall not be unlawful. The provision that is being replaced is flawed in so far as it permits a 19 year old to buy two trays of drink and deliver them to a 16 year old, as long as it happened at home, without any liability and without any parental involvement or consent being required. In the event that Senators are worried, I should say that the term "parents" includes people who are in loco parentis.Section 14 substitutes a new section for section 34 of the 1988 Act. It prohibits persons under the age of 18 from the bars of licensed premises. However, under subsection (2), a licensee may permit a child, defined as a person under 15, to be present if accompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 8 p.m. I have had discussions with a number of interested parties and I will be interested in and guided by the views of Members on the question of moving the 8 p.m. limit to 9 p.m., particularly in view of the fact that many people made the point that, on summer evenings, 9 p.m. is more reasonable.This discretion shall not apply where it appears to the licensee that the child's presence in the bar could reasonably be regarded as injurious to the child's health, safety or welfare. For example, if someone has a child in a pub all day, while he or she is drinking there, even though it is lawful for him or her to be there, the licensee is entitled to decide that it is injurious to the child's interests for such people to remain on the premises. Under subsection (3), a licensee may permit a person aged 15 to 17 to be present in the bar, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 8 p.m. Subsection (4) contains a number of exemptions to the general prohibition. The remaining subsections are broadly similar to existing provisions in section 34 of the 1988 Act.Section 15 introduces an entirely new provision in the form of the new section 34A to be inserted in the 1988 Act. It requires that persons under 21, apart from those in the company of a parent or guardian, will carry an age document in order to enter and remain in the bar, as opposed to any other room, of licensed premises. An age document may be a Garda age card, a passport, an identity card of a member state of the European Union, a driver's licence or a document prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister. An age document is not required in order to gain access to any other parts of the premises.This new obligation to produce an age document in order to gain admission to bars is intended to assist licensees in complying with provisions relating to under age consumption of alcohol and to assist gardaí in enforcing the law. The current voluntary system has always had the minor problem attached to it that one publican may think another publican will be more lax in his or her enforcement if he or she introduces a policy requiring its introduction, the consequence of which is that the lowest common denominator of enforcement tends to apply because of commercial pressures.In a recent conversation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, I suggested that this Bill would cause a problem with cross-Border situations because people come from the UK and Northern Ireland, in particular, into this State and may not have such cards. However, he helpfully pointed out that every Northern Ireland citizen, aged 18 or over, has a voter's card, a fact of which I had not thought. This type of document, which shows a person's photograph, date of birth and signature, can be designated by me under the residual provisions contained in the section. It will make it easy for people aged 18 to 21 to cross the Border and it is good news.Arising from preceding amendments, section 16 contains a number of further amendments to the 1988 Act. It amends sections 31(2) and 33(1) to provide that the consumption of intoxicating liquor by a person under 18 is conditional on the explicit consent of that person's parent or guardian. Second, it makes it an offence for a person aged 15 to 17 to be present in bars of licensed premises after 8 p.m. I am willing to consider extending the latter to 9 p.m. Finally, it amends the existing temporary closure order provision, under section 36A of the 1988 Act, as inserted by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000, in order to make it an offence not to affix a conspicuous notice giving details of the closure order as required by that provision.Section 17 has been introduced following discussions with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 11 June and the concerns expressed by Members in respect of off-licences. It contains provisions dealing with the consumption of intoxicating liquor purchased for consumption off the premises and, for this purpose, updates and replaces section 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act 1924. This section provides that a licensee shall be guilty of an offence if, with the licensee's knowledge or consent, intoxicating liquor supplied by the licensee in a closed container for consumption off the premises is consumed in another premises owned or controlled by the licensee or in a public place within 100 metres of the licensed premises. This limit of 100 metres is also referred to in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003. The person who consumes such intoxicating liquor shall also be guilty of an offence. If a licensee gives a person drink, on the basis that they consume it outside the off-licence, he or she will be committing a criminal offence. The section also restates the existing prohibition on the consumption in an off-licence of intoxicating liquor bought there.Section 18 is intended to permit any member of the Garda, whether in uniform or not, to enforce the licensing laws. At present, the powers of non-uniformed officers to inspect premises appear to be restricted to drugs-related offences under the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997.Section 19 provides that a person who claims that prohibited conduct has been directed against him or her in any licensed premises may seek redress before the District Court. For this purpose, prohibited conduct is defined as discrimination against, or sexual harassment or harassment, of a person contrary to Part II of the Equal Status Act 2000, on, or at the point of entry to, licensed premises. The forms of redress currently available under the Equal Status Act are being extended to include temporary closure of the premises concerned. For example, if someone was refused admission to a premises on the basis of his or her skin colour or sexual orientation, this provision would give the District Court the function of deciding whether that happened. It will also enable the District Court, in addition to the other remedies which were available to the equality tribunal, to make a closure order to emphasise the gravity of the infringement of the rights in question in the eyes of the court.Provision is also made in subsection (6) for the Equality Authority to apply to the District Court for redress in certain cases, while subsection (7) provides that the authority provide assistance to persons applying to the courts for redress. People have said that the equality tribunal was an easy place in which to claim redress, which I accept. However, I am now giving the Equality Authority the role of assisting people in making claims in the District Court, effectively giving it a right to participate where there are allegation that there have been infringements.I wish to emphasise that the proposed transfer of jurisdiction from the equality tribunal, ODEI, to the District Court is not intended to reflect any lack of confidence in or support for the work of the tribunal. It is rather a view that licensees should, in principle, be answerable for all their decisions in respect of admission, exclusion and maintaining order in their premises in a single jurisdiction. At present, the District Court is extensively involved in licensing matters, including the annual renewal of intoxicating liquor licences, the grant of special exemptions orders to licensed premises and the application of sanctions and penalties and temporary closure. It makes sense, therefore, to extend the court's jurisdiction to include the adjudication of cases taken against licensed premises under the Equal Status Act.Under existing licensing law, licensees are required to operate their premises in a peaceful and orderly manner. This is a licence renewal condition. If, for example, a licensee admits or serves a person who is violent or disorderly, the action could expose him or her to an objection to the renewal of the licence before the District Court on the grounds that it is not being properly operated. Not admitting or serving a person can, on the other hand, expose the licensee to a claim of discriminatory action before the Equality Tribunal. A situation in which a decision to permit or refuse entry of service could expose a licensee to actions in two jurisdictions with different results is unsatisfactory, which is why I am proposing to adjust existing arrangements. I propose that, in future, it will be the responsibility of the District Court to adjudicate in such cases. However, the non-discrimination provisions of the Equal Status Act will continue to apply and heavier penalties will be available to the District Court than are now available to the Equality Tribunal, including temporary closure and revocation of the licence on the grounds of objections because of discrimination.Section 20 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor at reduced prices during limited periods during any day. These are called, colloquially, "happy hours". This is intended to discourage practices which may lead to excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor. It will not prohibit or curtail practices such as sales or product promotions that take place over a period of days.Section 21 makes provision for two types of regulation. The first will prohibit or restrict licensees from engaging in promotional activities that are likely or intended to encourage people to consume alcohol to an excessive extent, such as promotions inviting customers to drink all they can for a flat amount of money. The second will specify particulars to be affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for the purpose of establishing a link to assist the Garda in investigations, but not necessarily an evidential link for criminal purposes where off-licences are concerned.With regard to the first type of regulations, the Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended that promotional practices that are conducive or likely to result in excessive consumption of alcohol should be prohibited by law. That view is supported by the strategic task force.With regard to labelling requirements, section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that the name of the owner and the address of the premises should be clearly indicated on a label to be affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises. This has not been commenced for practical reasons and is now being repealed. I have included the new provisions arising from concerns expressed by Members, both in Dáil Éireann with regard to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and in the Oireachtas joint committee hearing on this Bill. Implementation of these provisions by means of regulation is intended to avoid any later challenge to the legislation on the grounds that proper procedures had not been followed. It is also intended to notify the European Commission of proposed regulations under this section in accordance with the EU technical standards or temporary directives.These measures will enable me to be reasonable in applying the provisions. There may be no good reason for labelling every bottle of expensive champagne sold inside a cardboard box because it is highly unlikely it would be handed over to young people to drink. However, there are strong reasons in certain cases for certain types of containers to be marked in a particular way. I want to have some flexibility in this regard.The EU directives are intended to enable the EU Commission and member states to examine in advance proposed national technical rules in the interests of transparency. I am not free to do things which can interfere with trade. For example, if French wine exporters argued that to label and open each container was an infringement of their rights I would be in trouble with the EU Commission if I did not get their advance agreement.Section 22 deals with the application to register clubs. Sections that amend or replace existing sections in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 already apply to registered clubs by virtue of section 16 of the 2000 Act. Section 23 determines the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts in relation to sections 9 and 19.Section 24 contains two amendments to the Equal Status Act. The first is intended to safeguard the discretion of licensees in relation to the presence of persons under the age of 18 years in bars of licensed premises. The House will recall the furore over this prior to the last general election. The proposal is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force.The second amendment provides that a licensee may set a minimum age for the sale and consumption of alcohol which is above the statutory minimum age of 18 as long as the policy is publicly displayed and is implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. It will be possible, for example, for somebody to refuse the sale of bottles of vodka to people under the age of 21 years. As long as a notice to this effect is clearly displayed on the premises, he or she will not be in the position of a licensee who was recently ordered to pay compensation of €1,000 to a person who was discriminated against on age grounds in those circumstances. It must be non-discriminatory on other grounds and clearly advertised. If it is a rule of the off-licence that people under the age of 25 years are not sold huge amounts or certain types of drink, it will not be an infringement of their equal status rights provided the rule is clearly advertised and not applied as a means of getting at other people on other prohibited grounds.I have an open mind on the provision regarding the 8 p.m. limit for the presence of children on premises. Some have argued that in rural parts of the west there is almost a 40 minutes difference in lighting on a fine summer's evening and that the 8 p.m. limit is too onerous. If the House is of that view I will be happy to concur.I am conscious that the introduction of the age document in section 15 at this stage of the tourism season might create difficulties for young people coming from Great Britain or Northern Ireland without passports or identity cards. It would be reasonable, therefore, to defer commencement of that until later in the year, possibly the early autumn, when the tourism season has abated. I look forward to the debate in the House and I reiterate my thanks to Members for facilitating me with this legislation at such short notice.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the Bill and agree with most of its provisions. Senators got the Bill in their post this morning and we are dealing with Second Stage today. More importantly, we are being asked to take Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow. I do not understand why the Minister is seeking to rush the Bill through the House. I understand his desire to have it passed before the summer recess, but the Bill, for which we have called on many occasions, is so important that it deserves to be given more time and considered with due care and attention. It would have been better had more time been allocated to the various Stages. I hope it will not be rushed through the Dáil in the same fashion, although it probably will. It is a pity the Bill was not introduced long before now.I hope this very important Bill will deliver what we need in this area. Alcohol abuse in this country has in recent years given rise to serious concern and many serious public order offences on the streets. In extreme cases these have resulted in death. We need to tackle the problem.I agree with the Minister that many of these problems arise from the state of the economy. People have much more disposable income, especially the young, who work for their pocket money. None of this is handed up to their parents anymore; it is their disposable income and they are spending far too much of it on alcohol. I do not know if providing laws will change their attitudes, but it will be interesting to see whether any of these measures have the desired effect. I look forward to a review.There are many aspects to our drinking culture which stem primarily from the home in terms of the example given by parents and the extent to which they control their young children. When we are dealing with alcohol abuse, we must not focus on young people only. As we know well, we could go out on the streets tonight and find that trouble is being caused by people in their 20s or 30s. They may even be older. The measures in the Bill will apply to everybody and it is to be hoped that the desired effect will be achieved. Alcohol abuse costs the country €2.4 billion each year, or €600 per person, which could be spent in many other areas where it is badly needed.Of 15 and 16 year old boys, 66% are current drinkers. Approximately 33% of 15 and 16 year olds binge drink. This is something we did not see ten years ago when the same level of alcohol abuse did not exist among young people. Our hospitals are seeing the results of this, as Members will know from our discussion of the recent "Prime Time" programme which brought the matter home to so many parents who saw what was happening on our streets. The programme showed the extent to which young people will go in terms of the amount of drink they imbibe. In many cases, they end up in accident and emergency rooms. Every night, 25 drink-related assaults occur on our streets. That is a shocking and frightening figure for parents. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform knows the experience of having a child assaulted, as do I. It is horrific to allow one's young child into town at night only to discover later that they have been subject to a drink-related assault.Every measure in the legislation is worthwhile, but unless they are enforced there will not be any benefits. There are laws already in place which are not enforced and I doubt whether some of the measures in this legislation will be either. The provision which permits gardaí to enter a public house in uniform or out of it is very positive, but it is not clear whether we have the personnel to take advantage of it. Do gardaí have time to do it?I rang a Garda station in Blanchardstown recently and asked them to attend an incident I witnessed which had the potential to become very serious. I was told that it would be three hours before they could get to me. I know the Minister is sick and tired of the Opposition speaking continually about the lack of gardaí and the absence of the additional 2,000 personnel the Government promised, but unless there are sufficient gardaí to monitor and enforce the Bill's provisions, this will be a waste of time. It will be extremely difficult for a publican to put a regular out of his pub who is drunk and disorderly or a danger to others. We are placing huge responsibilities on publicans. I agree with the measures, but we will have to wait to see if they are implemented by publicans or not.I agree with reverting to the early closing time on Thursday. As the Minister said, Fine Gael has suggested that we should also roll back on the Friday and Saturday opening hours.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I agree with that.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I am a liberal person and I would have no difficulty with allowing public houses to remain open 24 hours a day if people were able to deal with alcohol in the way that people in Spain can deal with it. My son was working in a pub there last year and it remained open all night. Pubs in Spain close for an hour between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., but there is no violence on the streets. The people there can take their drink. I would prefer to keep the closing hours as they stand, but the Commission on Liquor Licensing reported that since opening hours were extended incidents of public disorder have increased significantly. The numbers are frightening and they must be related to late opening.I would like the Minister to repeal the late opening on Friday and Saturday. I have not decided whether to put down an amendment to provide for that. I will consider it over the next hour or so. The matter needs to be reviewed, which is why I welcome the Minister's promise to do so.If we had the gardaí on the street, we would not have the serious anti-social and public disorder problems that exist at present. It is the lack of a Garda presence which is at issue. The Irish youngsters who go to work in Munich and other European cities are told that it is not acceptable to misbehave there. They know that if they do they will be picked up by the authorities. Anti-social behaviour is not tolerated there, but it is tolerated here. If one walks down the street late at night, one will see people doing all sorts of things, but there are no gardaí there to arrest them.I agree with many of the Bill's provisions including the requirement for identity cards for those under 21. The Minister asked if Fine Gael would allow children under the age of 15 to remain in a public house until 9 p.m., but I would prefer to keep the limit at 8 p.m. I attended a committee meeting in recent days at which a Member raised the issue of a person returning from a match at Croke Park who wished to have a meal in a pub with their young kids. It was thought that 8 p.m. was a little too early. However, if one enters a pub on a Sunday, one will see very young children running around uncontrolled. I do not want to see them in the pubs at 9 p.m. when they should be at home. I recommend that the Minister maintains the limit at 8 p.m.I have asked about labelling on previous occasions. It will be of great assistance to gardaí who meet young people out and about with the cans they have bought in an off-licence or pub if it can be ascertained which establishment sold the alcohol.Any measures we can introduce to control what is happening are welcome. The measure existed previously, but it was not a regulation. I would like the Minister to have it provided in the legislation that pubs must use closed circuit television within and outside their premises. The great benefits of the use of CCTV are evident and I would like to see the Minister impose its use on publicans. I agree with many of the provisions. My big problem with the legislation, however, is that it will not be enforced because the resources are not available to do so. I look forward to the rest of the debate.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Minister is a frequent visitor to the House which is indicative of the amount of legislation he is dealing with, his attention to his portfolio and the frequency with which this House raises issues of public importance. This Bill amends all of the licensing laws since 1833, a period of 170 years. I was speaking to Senator Moylan earlier today and he told me he had recently come across a report in the local newspaper that a person had been fined a number of shillings under one of the provisions of the licensing laws. The court had to be adjourned for an hour in order that calculators could be consulted to determine what the fine should be. It must have been a mandatory fine. That demonstrates the need to update the law, a point that has been made regularly. This legislation is a step in the right direction in that regard.The Commission on Liquor Licensing, which deserves our compliments, was established in 2000 and issued its report in March 2003. Much of the content of this Bill is a result of that report. It would be churlish not to acknowledge the Minister's commitment in so expeditiously dealing with the recommendations and ensuring they were brought before the House just three months after the report was issued. In the past 12 months this House has had many debates on alcohol abuse and public order, both of which are connected to the Bill to a greater or lesser degree. The Bill deals with combating drunkenness, disorderly conduct, under age and binge drinking. It is intended to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the intoxicating liquor code.It is worth noting that this issue commanded the attention of the social partners which provided in chapter two of Sustaining Progress that an effort be made to tackle alcohol abuse. This abuse has a devastating effect on individuals and those around them. Alcohol abuse within families not only causes immediate trauma but can have a lifelong adverse effect on children exposed to it at an early age. The Minister has taken a strong stance in addressing this issue.I welcome the definition of "drunkenness" in section 2. I presume it is the result of consultation with various parties. It states that a drunken person "means a person who is intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger himself or herself or any other person in the vicinity, and "drunk" and "drunkenness" are to be construed accordingly". It is a good and logical definition. People acting in that manner obviously need to be taken to task by the licensee and the legal authorities.Representations were made about the definition of "licensee". There was concern that people acting on their behalf, be they staff or otherwise, would be covered by the definition. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this. What is the position of a leaseholder? A practice has arisen, which we should not discourage, whereby a large corporate entity has expanded into both the hotel and licensed vintners trade. It leases its pubs and ensures within the lease that they are operated to a good standard. I presume that the licensee would the leaseholder. Might complications arise in that regard? It seems a little unfair that if the leaseholder, who is the licensee, has passed on obligations to the lessee, that the lessee would not be culpable in some way in this regard. That struck me from some of the points made in the objections and comments the Minister received.The Minister mentioned the varying degrees of responsibility the State and individuals have. If I have a criticism of the Bill, it is that we might be moving the balance of responsibility too much towards the licensee and not enough towards the individual. The fine for a first offence in the case of a licensee is €1,500 and €2,000 for subsequent offences but for the individual it is €300 for the first offence and €500 for subsequent offences. I can call to mind various people who might well be apprehended under the provisions of the Bill and who would not have those financial resources. That is a complication. Where people have those resources, however, one could ask who is causing the greatest offence, the individual, by being drunk and disorderly in the licensed premises, causing offence and creating difficulty for others there to enjoy themselves, or the licensee, who may not have attended to the problem as promptly or efficiently as he or she should have. This provision might be revisited on Committee Stage. Arising from this there is a duty under sections 7 and 8 to preserve order and prevent disorderly conduct. It is right to have that obligation; it is a condition of the licence that the holder maintain a satisfactory code of practice in the premises in order that people are not put at risk.Section 9 provides for temporary closures. A temporary closure is virtually mandatory under the provision and I can understand its inclusion. It is an effective remedy because it will have a serious impact on the ongoing financial viability of licensed premises. However, there could be a small amelioration of the closure for a first offence. In other words, the fine should apply in the first instance but a second or subsequent offence would result in temporary closure. Perhaps this could be considered. As there is a probability of the Probation Act being applied, perhaps the legislation should reflect this.Senator Terry made an interesting point about section 10, which changes the closure times from 12.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Thursday nights, and raised the prospect of extending this to Fridays and Saturdays. Following a meeting of the local authority last night, I discovered the local hotel in the town centre had discontinued its discos at weekends. An adjoining fast food outlet closed recently, too. The problem of public disorder which often emanated around closing time from the fast food outlet, in a special exemption area, has gone. I hope it will not return. It highlights the point that special exemption orders result in people leaving premises late at night under the influence of drink, congregating in areas and getting into conflict with each other. People can drink until 10.30 p.m., 11.30 p.m. or 12.30 a.m.As my party's spokesperson on justice, I should perhaps not say this, but I have never had great difficulty with pubs closing even after those hours – regardless of whether they had an exemption order – providing that everything was orderly and that no difficulties arose. There is an element of common sense to be exercised in these areas.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is, in some ways, setting an example to some of his colleagues in other Departments in terms of the enhancement of local government. I welcome the introduction in the Bill of a consultative role for local authorities with regard to special exemption orders because these have an impact on the society of which local councillors are representative. It is appropriate, therefore, that local councillors be able to comment and that the judge would have to take that into account in arriving at a decision. I might have gone further and given local authorities this role completely, as happens in other jurisdictions, but in light of the system in operation here, the Minister has gone quite a way in respect of this matter. I welcome that and I urge him to resist any advocacy he may be receiving to the contrary from various interested parties.I have heard some associations argue that music should be allowed to continue during drinking-up time, but, as the Minister said, this is also a cooling down period. One cannot finish one's drink and be on the dance floor at the same time. To do so would certainly invite an accident. I agree that the half-hour drinking up time should be for precisely that purpose and that there should be no distractions from people finishing their drinks. Given the price of alcohol today, it should be an offence to squander resources by leaving any of it behind.Sections 13 to 16, inclusive, deal with under age drinking. The introduction of controls in this area is welcome. The necessity to provide proof of age is long overdue and we should continue with it regardless of any resistance the Minister might encounter. I am not sure whether the identification requirements should be expanded beyond the age of 21. There are 22 and 23 year-olds who look younger than 21, so I do not know whether difficulties will arise.Regarding the time at which children under 18 should vacate licensed premises, I have a different view to that enunciated by Senator Terry. I am inclined to suggest that the Minister make a distinction between summer time and winter time. There are people who will travel with their families – this is something we should encourage – on a Sunday and they may go for a drink, a meal or whatever on the way home. For people leaving the beach on a fine summer's evening, the 8 p.m. cut off point can be a bit tight.I do not know whether the Minister would wish to do this, but I would also make a distinction between, on one hand, pubs that are exclusively licensed premises and hotels, in particular, on the other. Not all hotels would have rooms other than the bar where families can go to enjoy a drink or whatever. I suggest that children be allowed to stay in hotel bars until 10 p.m. and until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. in other licensed premises in summer time, with the 8 p.m. limit remaining in winter time. That should be considered.We should be trying to achieve the implementation of this Bill in a way to which the public will subscribe without feeling that it is an undue imposition upon their normal activities where they are acting responsibly. It might be prudent, therefore, to take a more lax approach initially so that if difficulties are identified in a review, we can then tighten the legislation. Doing it the other way around might build up certain opposition to the introduction of these measures.On section 17, I have some sympathy with licensed vintners on the issue of consumption within the vicinity of their premises, particularly if it is within a range of 100 metres. This may impact unfairly upon licensed vintners. It is not easy for them to patrol in this manner and people are ingenious when it comes to circumventing and breaking the law. I have no doubt that measures will be taken to do that. I suggest that the impact of this provision on licensed vintners be monitored very closely and form a significant part of any review.With regard to the inspections by gardaí, whether in uniform or not, I can certainly see the reason for this. On a note of caution, however, I put it to the Minister that we should avoid a situation where some unscrupulous licensees might be tempted to oil the wheels of enforcement. That needs to be monitored in order to see what will happen.I fully agree with transferring certain responsibilities from the equality tribunal to the District Court. People can still seek redress before the District Court. Sometimes when people think of equality they take the concept literally. We have had a situation in my town where, for funerals involving specific families, the Garda have gone around days in advance asking all licensed premises to close for the day of the funeral simply because they anticipated difficulties and trouble. In such a scenario, the publicans do not have very significant rights on their side, and we should ensure greater balance. I have had experience myself of Travellers trespassing on my land and, in the company of a garda, suggesting that if I paid them £1,500 they would move. When I asked why I should do that, they replied that this is how much it would cost me anyway to go to court and force them to leave.We have got to be sensible and logical in the way we apply legislation. I disagree that persons caught under the equality legislation should be able to object to the renewal of a licence. The equality legislation should be dealt with on its own merits and have its own penalties. That should not be one of them. The Bill is a fine example of the Minister's determination to confront issues of public concern, and the House should commend him because we have encouraged him in the past to do that. I welcome the introduction of the Bill.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I have just a few comments to make on the Bill. I welcome it in general but note that it is really a kind of stop-gap measure. The Minister has very engagingly acknowledged this. I welcome the Minister's statement that one of the commission's recommendations is a codification of the intoxicating liquor code currently spread across many statutes. This means, in other words, consolidating and reviewing the entire code. That is where the real action is going to be and it is very important that we do this.I will return to this matter later but, without intending any insult or insinuation about the operation of the licensing laws at present or the professionalism of personnel in the Dublin District Court, I ask the Minister to look at how the licensing laws are enforced in practice. We have never done that. There is obviously something wrong with the system, but one takes one's life in one's hands by criticising the Judiciary, certainly outside of these hallowed walls. There is something wrong, however, and I do not know why the Judiciary is not telling us about it. It is just implementing the law. The latter is clearly deficient, however, so why is the Judiciary not saying something?If one criticises the Judiciary in public, one gets into difficulty. I am not making any implication here, but I would like to know why – I am sure it is because of our deficiencies as legislators – there is not some channel whereby judges can ask us to review laws. If there was some kind of meeting place between these two branches of Government, judges could tell us if they are troubled by a law that they are applying, that they are not very happy with the results of its application but that they are bound by its provisions. Could we not establish a mechanism where they could alert the Oireachtas to their concerns? We sometimes read about it in the newspapers when a judge criticises the Oireachtas. Why is there not a proper, efficient bridge whereby, without causing abrasions, contusions, difficulties and outrage, we could learn from each other and know where they were?I am not criticising the operations of the court except in so far as it produces a result that is absolutely lousy but I would like to know, for example, how it is that half the pubs in Dublin get licensed. There are pubs in my area where there are machine gun battles along the counter, yet they get their licences renewed. Is this a peaceable way of conducting their business?It seems that judges do not have to ask questions. Nowadays, if I understand it correctly, the judge only investigates, or is only required to investigate, when there is an objection from the Garda. That is a dereliction of duty. There is a responsibility when issuing a certificate to say the premises in question is worthy to be opened as a licensed premises which is a place where many dangers can ensue. Why is it not an absolute obligation in law, as it is in morality, for the person issuing the licence to be sure that it is a proper and reputable premises? When I taught in Trinity College I gave recommendations to my students. My recommendations were all highly valued because I never gave them out unless I knew the people involved and what the circumstances were. If there was something shady in his past, I would advise him to get somebody else to write it because I was not going to stand over it unless I could say he was caught with half of the Odyssey written down his or her left arm, under the cuff, in an examination. The same standards should apply in courts.

Recently the Garda, the civic authorities and neighbours objected to a place near where I live, The Temple. I will not sully the record of the House with the descriptions of the behaviour outside as a result of the excessive drinking. The pub was repeatedly granted its licence. How did this happen?The centre of Dublin is over-endowed with these enormous aircraft hangars where young people are force fed into the drinks situation. How do they get their licences? Perhaps nobody objects. The very word "judge" suggests judgment. Is there not a requirement to probe every single licence application? If not, is there not some system that could be applied before they get to judges, who I know are busy people, to say there is a recommendation from the Garda or whoever it is? Every single premises should be investigated. I also know it is because of some legal anomaly the judge, apparently, has no discretion in this.We are talking about violence in O'Connell Street, yet through the enactment of our laws and through their application in the courts, we are licensing the selling of drink at all hours of the day and night by supermarkets along O'Connell Street. That is pouring petrol on a burning fire. Why is this happening and what can we do to make sure that it does not continue to happen? This is a difficult situation.I am a libertarian, laissez faire kind of person. I do not give a damn if people drink at 5 a.m. That is not what worries me. I do not think that it worries the Minister either. What worries all of us is the behaviour of people after they have drunk. We have a huge job of education to do to show that certain behaviours are not acceptable. I approve of the Minister's very timely and useful intervention to protect the rights of licensees who want to exclude people. The licensee has a perfect right to tell somebody who is behaving badly to get out of his or her pub but that does not always resolve all the problems.Last weekend – I was just home from London and the aeroplane was late – as I went down to get a bottle of milk, I saw my local, decent publican standing at the open door of his premises and stopped to talk to him. Two young lads and a girl went past, they wanted to get in but the publican said he was closed. They drifted off, came back and one of them said to me, quite pleasantly, "You are the fellow off the TV." The other lad then said, "You are the effing queer off the TV" at which the girl decided to investigate and grabbed me by a certain section of my anatomy that I will cover by the discreet appellation of the undercarriage. Her companion was so thrilled by this phenomenon that he came up and hit me an almighty clout on the ear which is still ringing from the effect.I asked my pal, the publican, if he would mind calling the Garda, which came around pretty quickly. When I rang to ask if somebody could be sent down, I was asked if I could give a detailed description of the apparel, the age and appearance, and so on, of the people involved. I said I could but that I had not the slightest intention of doing so. When asked why not, I said it had another thing coming if it thought I was going to stand in the middle of Parnell Street with a thick ear, drivelling down the phone to the effect that assailant no. 1 was wearing an off-the-shoulder number, diamanté with matching accessories and slingback shoes from Carl of Manhattan. It brought the van round and scooped them up. As they were being put into the car, one said, "You are effing joking." His lady companion stuck her head into the van and gave a description of the gardaí which I will not share with the House. When I asked why they did not arrest her, they said they had been called worse. I am waiting to have my vocabulary extended to find out what was worse than what that lassie called them.This illustrates in a simple way that there is violence; even when someone politely says they are closed, there can still be violence because of the behaviour. The drinking is not the problem but the behaviour. The Minister has experience of this in his own family whereby violence can be perpetrated on young people and drink is not the problem. On Bloomsday – this was very sad – one of the young actors was wearing an enormous papier maché heads of James Joyce, which was set alight. He could very easily have had his head burnt off but for the rapid intervention of some others. I do not understand this kind of nastiness. I very much welcome the codification and hope that there will be this investigation.I am not casting any slurs on the District Court but why is there this anomalous situation? There are many instances where the Garda, the local authorities and local people have objected, yet the pub gets its licence. I am not impugning that decision but to get that result there is something wrong somewhere and if it is not with the court, it is with the law.The Minister referred to the rights of the drinks industry but he need not have bothered. The industry is well able to look after them. I never saw such a ferocious lobby in this House and other places. I welcome the fact that the grounds of closure order are being extended to include nuisance to neighbours. This is a question of behaviour and I do not see any reason people should have to tolerate drunken and disgusting behaviour outside their premises.With regard to the removal of the Equality Authority from the operation, this is a mistake for a number of reasons. People are more likely to make a complaint to the authority than the District Court. They do not want to go to court, about which they are inhibited, particularly in areas like—

It is so unnerving. I thank the Acting Chairman for that reminder.People are reluctant to go to court, particularly in a situation where sexual orientation is involved, even though we have changed the law and so on. Perhaps because I have got older and more used to this, I am surprised that many young people would hesitate going into open court in the District Court. On this occasion I will make a criticism which may be 20 or 30 years out of date. People have a long memory of the way they were treated in the District Court. I recall the jibes and insults routinely showered on gay people in the Dublin District Court. They do not have a happy memory of the place and will not be happy to go there. Why do we use the term "learned judge"? Are there two categories, learned judges and those less learned? I understand a learned judge expressed the view that this was a way around the Equality Authority and would weaken it. This was quoted on radio. I see the Minister shaking his head; obviously, he does not believe this. I doubt that he wants to weaken the Equality Authority but these are people involved with the law and we need to listen to them.With regard to the times at which people are allowed to have their children on licensed premises, I have taken up the Minister's suggestion. That was one of the reasons I left the Chamber, for I thought I would get in first and table an amendment straight away, since we are galloping apace with this legislation. I have produced a kind of half measure and would like to take the few minutes remaining to recommend it to the Minister.Section 14 amends subsection 34(2)(a) of the 1988 Act to provide:It shall not be unlawful for such a holder to allow a child who is accompanied by his or her parent or guardian to be in the bar of the licensed premises between 10.30 a.m. (12.30 p.m. on a Sunday) and 8 p.m.I want to leave that unchanged, since it refers to children and does not make any difference to people of 15 to 18. I do not think it appropriate to have young children in the bar of a public house after 8 p.m. I am not sure it is appropriate to have them there even before that time. There are many irresponsible parents who damage their children by trailing the poor little brats around after them into bars and lounges. I really do not think that an appropriate environment. However, it is fair enough for people between the ages of 15 and 18 to be allowed to stay for the extra hour until 9 p.m. rather than being sent to bed by Nanny at 8.01 p.m. I have therefore tabled an amendment to section 3 to provide that it shall not be unlawful for a person between 15 and 18 and to change the time to 9 p.m. That is reasonable, for one is allowing people who are on the threshold of adulthood, if not already adult, to remain with their peer group. However, I cannot see any justification for encouraging children to be in pubs at that late hour.I have another question about how licensing laws operate. I gather that matters have been much improved since, but 15 to 20 years ago I witnessed a rubber-stamp situation in the District Court which I felt was not appropriate. Special exemptions are a matter of definition. What is so special about them? They are all over the place. I had thought there was a requirement that a special exemption be for something special, but I know places in my district which get 30 in a month. There is nothing special about that, so the whole thing is a farce. It is just a way of getting round the licensing laws. If we are to have a special exemption, let us have it tightened up so that we know what it is – the barman's birthday or the anniversary of the Pope's coronation. Whatever it is, let us have a special reason for a special exemption.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on bringing forward this legislation, an initiative which I consider both urgent and timely. I am pleased the Bill is being introduced in the Seanad, since we have had several debates on the issue in recent months, in particular one on the serious concerns raised regarding the abuse of alcohol by young people. I welcome the Bill's measures as timely and necessary. If we are to be serious in combating the effects of alcohol abuse in this country, we must introduce legislation that is not just token in its approach but serious in its content. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill's scope, which shows his determination to tackle this worrying abuse in today's society. Reading the explanatory memorandum and examining the Bill's contents, I am tempted to observe that it does everything that it says on the tin.To put in context what we are debating today, I remind the House of the statistics placed before us by international studies of alcohol consumption in this country. I referred to them in a previous debate, but it is timely that we once again focus our minds on them. As a nation, we are now drinking more than almost all our EU colleagues. In the last six years, the consumption of spirits alone has increased by over 50%, while there has been a staggering increase of nearly 100% in cider consumption. Between 1989 and 1999, per capita alcohol consumption increased by a massive 41%.Those statistics are even more staggering when we compare them with our EU neighbours. Nine of the other EU member states have shown a decrease in alcohol consumption over the same period, while three countries showed a modest increase of just 5%. If we look back in ten years to view the present figures and see that they are not the height of the curve, we are in danger of a very serious problem. Binge drinking among young people has also been highlighted in international studies, particularly among people of 15 and 16. That is also an area of serious concern.I note that the Bill precedes another, much more comprehensive Bill now being prepared. The Minister intends it to reform and codify the entire liquor licensing laws of Ireland. While the major Bill now in preparation will in due course require lengthy debate, I hope that this Bill will be speedily enacted. Wisely, the Minister has sought to deal with a limited number of well-defined objectives which require immediate attention. Measures include the updating of provisions and penalties first fixed in 1872, amending and fine-tuning legislation of a more recent vintage, and innovative measures appropriate to modern social conditions.Having served as a member of a local authority for the past four years, I warmly welcome the Minister's proposals to allow them to set the boundaries of late-night licensed trading in their areas. For the first time, the views of ordinary citizens in cities and towns across Ireland about what they will tolerate will be formally communicated, through their elected local representatives, to their local District Court. In some ways, that might address some of Senator Norris's concerns.I would like to deal in more detail with those provisions of the Bill which have caught my attention and a few aspects which the Minister might examine before Committee Stage. The provisions under sections 4 to 9 in Part 2 of the Bill largely update and improve the law regarding the sale or supply of drink to persons who are already drunk, offences committed by people who have become drunk, and the obligation of the licence-holder to keep an orderly house. All those provisions are welcome, and I have only two minor issues which I ask the Minister to examine. First, I wonder why the provision in section 18 of the Licensing Act 1872 entitling a licence-holder to turn out of the premises any person who is drunk has not been repeated or replicated in the provision of paragraph 4(1) of the Bill. I respectfully submit that, at the same time as requiring the licence-holder to refuse to admit any drunken person, there should be formal recognition of the licence-holder's right to remove from his or her premises any drunken person who has already gained admission and who has refused to comply with a lawful request to leave, subject, of course, to the limitation that only moderate or reasonable force be used in removing the drunken person from the premises.I appreciate that, under section 6(1), it will be an offence for a drunken person to refuse to leave the licensed premises when requested to do so, either by the licence-holder or the gardaí. However, I wonder whether it is fair and proper, having regard to the legal, practical and insurance issues which daily arise for publicans, hoteliers and their employees, to impose a statutory obligation on licence-holders to refuse to admit drunken persons and at the same time fail to recognise and uphold their right to remove those who have already entered the premises when observed to be drunk. Worse still are cases where people enter a premises having already been lawfully refused admission. Can the licence holder do no more than call the Garda?Section 9 is significant and welcome. It deals with the mandatory application of closure orders for licensed premises in the event of convictions under the new offences in the Bill of permitting drunkenness, disorderly conduct on licensed premises and irresponsible trading practices. These closure orders were first introduced in the 1988 Act and will now be extended to these additional serious offences, which is a welcome further measure in the fight against drink-induced anti-social behaviour.Sections 10 and 11 bring closing time back to 11.30 p.m. on Thursdays and permit local authorities to set the times for the late night licensing trade. Those are sensible and practical moves which are also welcome. We need to use a leash method. We extended the hours and now we must review the situation, so a tug on the leash every now and then is no harm.The limitations and conditions now being imposed on District Courts for granting special exemption orders for the late night licensing trade is also welcome. Section 12, if enacted, should assist the Garda in the orderly clearance of late night dancing venues at a reasonable time, without spoiling the fun for anyone.The Minister referred to section 14 and said that he is open to other views on extending, from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., the time at which those under 15 years must leave licensed premises. It should remain at 8 p.m., however, as that is a reasonable time for any child to leave. If we opted for Senator Norris's amendment, we would be obliged to introduce two identity cards – one for those over 18 and another for those over 15. There would be red and yellow cards, so perhaps we should stick to 8 p.m.The extension and clarification of what documents will be acceptable as proof of age in section 15 is also welcome. There is enough scope there for everyone to comply and it should serve young adults and licence holders well.Sections 13 and 16 clarify the existing exception of drinking in a private residence with parental consent. The Minister should reconsider this. The provisions of section 31(2) of the 1988 Act may be too wide and may encourage irresponsible parents and guardians, on one hand, while facilitating retrospective parental consent to avoid prosecution or conviction, on the other. There have been cases of under age persons ordering alcohol, from cider to spirits, and having it collected and delivered by taxi to a private residence as though ordering a pizza. This provision should be reworked so that, in the event of a prosecution, it would be open to a court to hold that the purchase for, supply to or consumption by a person under 18 years in a private residence would not be unlawful where there was explicit consent from that person's guardian and where the surrounding facts and circumstances were reasonable in the opinion of the court. In this event, the court could have regard to issues such as the quantity and type of alcohol purchased, supplied or consumed, the location and time of consumption and whether there was parental or adult supervision at the relevant time.Section 18 provides for gardaí not in uniform to enter, inspect and observe within licensed premises for the purpose of preventing or detecting offences under the licensing Acts. That should increase conviction rates.Section 19 provides for the transfer of jurisdiction in equality cases to the District Court and it contains adequate safeguards for those who would otherwise bring such cases to the equality tribunal. Every District Court decision in such cases shall be in writing and the court must give a reason for the decision made in providing for the right of appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court. Section 19 is the essence of practical good sense and removes an anomaly which has given rise to some unusual decisions in recent times. I commend the Minister for restoring common sense to both the licensing and equality laws in this regard.Sections 20 and 21 are new provisions in Irish law which respond quickly to a recent disturbing trend in drink retailing, namely, the promotion of a particular premises, product or brand by irresponsible special offers and discounts such as "all you can drink" challenges for a fixed sum admission price. We seem to be moving from happy hours to nightmare nights. These provisions refer to persons on a licensed premises consuming intoxicating liquor to an excessive extent, as referred to in section 21(1)(a). This may have to be extended to include persons likely to be attracted to licensed premises by promotion. In addition, since there is no statutory definition of what is excessive, it might be helpful to broaden the definition of what is unacceptable to include, for example, the consumption of intoxicants which, in the opinion of the court, is excessive, unreasonable or unhealthy.I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his urgent action in dealing with matters of immediate public concern. I look forward to the early passage of the Bill into law as well as the promised major Bill dealing with licensing law promised for mid-2004. The Enlightenment philosopher John Locke once noted, that for laws to be effective they need to be written in men's hearts. The Minister's actions in bringing forward the Bill are compatible with that sentiment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I thank the Minister for coming before the House and for his contribution.I am unhappy with the speed with which the Bill is being dealt with. We need time to review legislation of this nature in order to see what improvements we might suggest and for the Minister to consider those suggestions properly, rather than having to do so hastily. We should take Second Stage one week and deal with the subsequent Stages the following week.I welcome the changes made after the committee meeting last week, including those which took account of submissions by Labour Party Members. In general, rather than an interim measure, we should go straight for considered, comprehensive legislation, perhaps involving Green and White Papers. That is not to rule out urgent amendments or tidying provisions which could be made in the meantime – some of these are included here – but there are also many new provisions in the Bill. I agree with some of them and not with others, but they should not be brought forward in a piecemeal way. The matter should be dealt with comprehensively.There is also the enforcement of existing provisions. I am concerned about whether some of the new measures – such as the drunkenness provision – can be enforced. The most important issue is under age drinking and enforcement is a fundamental aspect of this. Improvements, some of which are included in the Bill, can be made in this area.I raised at committee level concerns about children in pubs. I retain those concerns, despite the Minister's comments at last week's meeting. We must separate the issues of children in pubs and under age drinking because they are totally different. Some people do not like children in pubs, but I do not have that concern. It is very much a moralising thing for us to make judgments about parents who bring their children into pubs. I am concerned that this provision is possibly anti-family and anti-parents of a certain age who have children under a particular age. I do not agree with children being in pubs unaccompanied or running riot, but parents with children should be facilitated, as is currently the case, in pubs and hotels. I am not ruling out considering this issue, but it is wrong to bring this provision forward at this stage. I suggest that the Minister consider a later time, perhaps 10 p.m. rather than 9 p.m.I do not agree with the provision that the owner of a licence may set the age limit for their premises. That is an anomaly in the legislation. I am totally against under age drinking of alcohol, but there should be definite criteria and there should not be discretion or discrimination in respect of one adult versus another. At least the provision on ID card facilitates the implementation of rules on under age drinking, but the setting of an age limit by a licence holder is of no assistance in trying to ensure that we tackle under age drinking; it is very much based on allowing subjective judgments to be made by licence holders. The latter runs contrary to other parts of the legislation.The Minister has amended the provisions on drunkenness, but I continue to have concerns about whether they can be enforced and about the definition of a drunken person, although it would be difficult to come up with a better definition than the one contained in the legislation. The provision in regard to a publican who serves a drunken person is severe and there will be difficulties with it. The mandatory closure order is a severe penalty for a publican who is in breach of this legislation. Since it is mandatory, this penalty should not be imposed for a first offence. That is one change I suggest to the Minister.I welcome the fact that local authorities are being brought into the scheme of things, but this issue should be considered more comprehensively in terms of future legislation. I will not disagree with the provision about rolling back closing time on Thursdays, but the issue of closing time needs to be looked at in a much broader way. I am in favour of more flexibility and the Minister should consider introducing pilot schemes where longer or more flexible closing times are brought in. That is being done in other countries. I do not see how bringing closing time forward by half an hour or bringing it back by half an hour is the way to deal with the problem. We need to look at this issue more comprehensively and in a more open-minded and modern way.Nightclub owners are concerned about the provision which prohibits entertainment for the last half hour of drinking time. Their concerns should be considered by the Minister.I wish to refer to the provisions in regard to the Equality Authority and the new jurisdiction for the District Court. I am concerned that these will create inconsistency and an anomaly in that other equality cases go to the equality tribunal, but these will not. Senator Norris raised concerns about these provisions and I agree with him in that regard. People might not be prepared to go to court, whereas they may be more inclined to go to the equality tribunal. The mediation function of the investigation officer of the tribunal will not be available in the District Court. Costs will now be a factor, but they were not in the case of the equality tribunal and that will be a deterrent in the bringing of cases. I appreciate the concerns about people abusing the equality legislation, but that matter is dealt with in the part of the legislation concerned with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. The latter are different issues from that of equality. Although they might sometimes be confused, it is wrong to roll back the equality legislation as a way to deal with people who abuse facilities in public houses.If there is a lot of difficult legislation for licence holders and their staff to implement, there should be requirements in respect of training for those in the licensed trade regarding their legal and other responsibilities. There should be a provision whereby under 18s would not be allowed to serve in pubs. Under section 34(2)(d), it is acceptable for an under age person to be in a pub if they are employed in it. That provision should be reconsidered.There is also the issue of cutbacks in other areas. Funding needs to be provided by the Government for the implementation of the Youth Work Act and for other initiatives because much more needs to be done to encourage young people to engage in leisure activities other than drinking alcohol. Senator Norris and others mentioned incidents in which they have been involved. I went into the city centre recently and somebody tried to start a fight with the person accompanying me. We saw things in the city centre which put us off going in again. If there were more gardaí on the beat, I would have felt much happier in the city centre despite those incidents.I am in favour of strict legislation, particularly with regard to under age drinking, and its enforcement. Whatever legislation we introduce should not be reactionary. We should have a broader and more open-minded approach to alcohol abuse and under age drinking. After this debate, I will be attending an event for the Special Olympics because the area I represent on the council, Lucan, is a host town for the Irish team. There is a great feeling around Lucan at present and I know it is the same in other towns. Many activities have been organised around the Special Olympics and they are all alcohol free. That is the type of thing which should be promoted in terms of trying to encourage people to have a different outlook, impressing on them that using one's leisure time is not only about getting drunk and that there are other ways to enjoy one's self.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I welcome the Minister. I do not know who informed him recently that he was talking the talk, but not walking the walk. With five or six Bills in as many weeks, we are certainly running to keep up with him. I was surprised to hear some Opposition Members state that the Minister is moving too fast with the Bill. Since 1997, they have been seeking debates on this issue and for action to be taken. Now that action is being taken, we are being asked for papers to be produced which might delay the Bill for two or three years. Now is the time to deal with this problem because it is at its worst.The Bill tackles drunkenness, disorderly conduct and addresses under age binge drinking. The Minister consulted widely before bringing it before the House. He consulted the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force and took on board all their recommendations. He also consulted the social partners. It is reasonable to state that he consulted wisely and has brought broad legislation before us.There is no doubt that we, as a nation, have lost the run of ourselves in respect of alcohol. Everything nowadays seems to revolve around drink. If there is a birth there is a booze-up, if there is a marriage there is another one and there is also one for a death. Every moment in between provides an occasion for drinking, in some capacity or other. I can recall in the place I work the general topic on a Monday morning between teenagers, 20 year olds, 30 year olds is how the weekend went and how much people had to drink, where they were and so forth. There is almost a prize-giving ceremony for the individual who consumed the most.I went to the Dublin-Laois match on Sunday. On the way home I dropped into my local to have something to eat. I came back there five hours later to see the same people there at 11 p.m., some of them falling into their drinks. Senator Jim Walsh referred to "the sin of leaving drink behind". These people were spilling it, which to my mind is even worse.The publican at this local has a clearing up time for children of 7 p.m. The match was over at 5.40 p.m., so it was a rush for certain families to get there and have their meal and their few drinks. At 7 p.m. the publican was ordering all children off the premises. That was too soon, given the circumstances. Maybe 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. is reasonable.Young people have been targeted in a big way in relation to the new culture of drinking, with some justification. If we reflect on the "Prime Time" programme, which was referred to during the debate on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill – the young girl saying she was drinking 15 vodkas and Red Bull in any given night – I wonder who ordered the last five for her. I know if I drank ten of them, English would be my second language. That is apart from the damage such drinking was doing to the young girl.The 35 to 55 year olds are also answerable for poor conduct where drink is concerned. I refer in particular to drinking and driving. I grew up in an age where people could drink and drive to their heart's content, without fear of the law. Very many people – and I include myself – found it extremely difficult to give up the habit. These are often the very people to criticise the young generation who are terrific in that regard. I would probably still be at it if it were not for my children. Young people are far more responsible in that regard than we are.One of the issues that is overlooked completely, however, is the damage drink is doing to these young people and to their bodies. At their age they feel untouchable. Maybe sufficient has not been said in this regard by the medical profession. I am not sure it is their job to do so. It would not be any harm if a programme was initiated whereby people were made aware of some of the negative aspects of the excessive consumption of alcohol. Drinking on this level inevitably gives rise to violence and thuggery and the fact that people cannot go out at night to enjoy themselves without feeling insecure and unsafe and without the freedom to do what they want.Members spoke this morning on that very topic during the debate on the European Convention on Human Rights, and freedom was referred to as a human right. If one cannot go out and do whatever one wants on a given night, it is a poor reflection on us as a society and as a nation. There is now much greater awareness of this issue. A report on public order offences, commissioned by the National Crime Council and mentioned by the Minister when last he was in the House, noted that the number of public order offences proceeded against had gone up by 160% between 1996 and 2001. The most frequently invoked section was drunkenness in public areas and threatening and abusive behaviour. That in itself indicates there is a strong link between public disorder and drinking.I welcome the stronger penalties the Minister is introducing in relation to the sale and supply of alcohol. People who own licensed premises should be responsible for the behaviour of the people within them. They are making enough money. I also welcome the proposed ban on ‘happy hour' drinking and the promotional element of alcohol, although I believe the Minister has to get clarification on this from the European Commission. Allowing people to drink their heads off within a specified period obviously can give rise to excessive drinking. I would imagine the faster one drinks the quicker one gets drunk.I also welcome the powers the Minister is introducing for non-uniformed gardaí. It is surprising that non-uniformed gardaí did not have the same powers as their uniformed colleagues. The provision for new closing hours, back to 11.30 p.m. on Thursday night, is also welcome, as is the initiative the Minister is giving to local authorities in relation to exemptions. That is a good thing. It gives local representatives who should have their finger on the pulse a better say in their communities.That could create a problem for someone like me as a councillor in Dublin if this is being widely invoked. If the position is as bad as Senator Norris has indicated, it would mean having to make representations on a daily if not an hourly basis. It is empowering local representatives to play a greater role, however, in making and shaping their communities, even though the Irish Nightclub Industry Association has problems with city councils and local authorities being involved. It fears it will mean an extra layer of bureaucracy. My own belief is that if people adhere to the law they should not have a problem, whether they are answering to a judge, local authority or otherwise.It is to be hoped the Bill passes through both Houses. The Minister is to be congratulated on the fine work he is doing.

I also welcome the Bill, although with some reservations. I believe it is being pushed through too fast. It would have been preferable if more time had been taken to research the Bill and examine some of its specific points. There are, however, aspects to the proposed legislation that should be welcomed.I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children which heard there has been a four-fold increase in the last five years in the number of women who were so drunk they could not remember if they had been sexually assaulted. Two years ago the VHI undertook a very effective poster campaign showing bottles and pints, with the caption: "Which one of these drinks can't be spiked? None of them". For more than two years people were worried about a "date rape" drug, Rohypnol. It transpired from the research that not one woman's drink had been laced with Rohypnol. It was all alcohol. It ended the myth that the misuse of Rohypnol was prevalent in our society. Instead, it was alcohol poisoning and that is why this issue should be addressed.The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill going through the Dáil proposes to give the Garda Síochána the power to seek closure of badly run licensed premises and fast food outlets. While I accept that public houses should be closed and have a responsibility, those offending should also have a responsibility. We are proposing to close down public houses but, eventually, we may be closing down schools and football grounds because of the violent behaviour of those emerging from them.There is a penalty points system associated with driving. Perhaps we should award penalty points against those shouting on the street late at night. The Garda Síochána has the power to fine on the spot but if someone emerges from a licensed premises and is abusive or threatening, it would be an idea to give him or her two penalty points. After receiving a certain number of points, he or she could be banned from drinking for a year. We are putting far too much emphasis on the licensed premises. Those entering them are also responsible for their actions.About five years ago I had a licensed premises and took a drink. A man came up to me and said he had had so many pints of cider one night that it made him rob cars. I turned to him and said I had drunk twice as much that night but that I went home quietly to my bedroom. Unfortunately, 95% to 99% of those who take a drink are being tarnished by the small percentage who constantly cause mayhem. It is time we put a stop to this.The Minister has stated a time will come when gardaí will operate hand-held video cameras and that if a licensee appears to be responsible for drunken people tottering out of his or her pub, he or she will face closure. Last week members of the Traveller community virtually laid siege to a pub in County Mayo, a point raised in the Seanad today. Last week most of the pubs and businesses in my town were closed for two days because of a funeral, as were most of the pubs in surrounding areas. Perhaps 30 or 40 gardaí – to whom I pay tribute – were present to make sure fights would not break out. If one is trying to run a business, it is not acceptable that one has to close for two days. In other towns pubs have had to close for two weeks in the one year because of the possibility of violence. This is unacceptable. We all have a responsibility in this regard.I welcome the fact that a licensee may permit a person aged 15 to 17 years to be present in a bar unaccompanied by a parent or guardian but not after 8 p.m. I ask that the Minister reconsider the time limit. He should not implement this measure now but wait six months. There is a difference between urban and rural areas. I despise the fact that there are many young people in pubs in urban areas. However, if this measure gets rid of the confirmation and communion discos, the Minister should reconsider. There are places, perhaps in rural areas, to which adults go for a drink and bring their 15 or 16 year old children. There should be a room adjacent to the pub with a pool table or television set in which the children can meet their friends while their parents are having a drink. Perhaps the Minister should consider a provision—

When I had a bar and somebody asked me if I would buy a certain person a drink, I was very conscious that that person might have come out to have only two or three drinks and that he or she might have been driving. I thought it common courtesy to suggest to him or her that somebody wanted to buy him or her a drink and give him or her the opportunity to say, "No, thank you. I am driving." I used to pass on this message to the person offering to buy the drink and state to him or her that his or her gesture was welcome. Not many publicans do this. It is not something for which we could legislate but could recommend that they do so. I am sick and tired of having pints thrown in front of me when I am driving. If one is dealing with a constituent, one is insulting him or her by not drinking a pint he or she purchases for one. As Senator Jim Walsh rightly stated, one is throwing money down the sink. I do not know how we can address this problem.The Bill contains many good provisions but I have a problem with section 21(1)(b), which deals with the responsibility of the off-licence to identify the products which will be sold on the premises. Will the Minister reconsider this proposal? It is not necessarily bad but impractical because the costs and labour involved in pricing an individual item are prohibitive and of no benefit. Will the Minister consider a provision whereby a judge could implement the aforementioned measure only where an off-licence has been prosecuted? In this case I would welcome it.People drink a lot now, as they did 20 years ago, but I have no doubt that a mixture of substances is being taken nowadays. I live over a shop and note that, 20 years ago, people coming out of licensed premises had a scream but the screams today are very sinister because those involved have taken substances other than alcohol. We must tackle this issue also.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I will deal with the matter quickly because I am losing time. The Bill is in response to public concern. I remember debates in the Seanad in recent months in which such concerns were expressed. The public asked for this Bill and wants the issue to be solved once and for all. How do we go about this? We started with the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, have addressed the issue of under age drinking very nicely and are now dealing with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. There are pitfalls – nothing is absolute. That is the reason we are discussing the matter. We are now discussing licensed premises to see how they can help to curtail the problems of drunkenness, binge and under age drinking.One is taking one's life in one's hands going out at the weekend. I was going to a film in Temple Bar on Friday last at 6.30 p.m. and young people were sitting around with their packs of drink. I have no doubt they were there long that time. There were huge droves of young people almost liquored up at that time. I looked at them, knowing I would be contributing to this debate today. There is something wrong with our culture if we allow ourselves to go down this road. I ask the Minister to play tough on it and I am with him. There is no way other than the holistic approach. It will not be easy.I welcome sections 4 to 8, inclusive, which deal with drunkenness. The Minister will have no trouble handling that issue because we can all see the drunk in the pub. If we are in the pub, it is up to us to remind the barman of the legislation and that he should not sell him drink. We would have no difficulty in helping the barman or the worker. As citizens we have a role here. The blame should not be put totally on the publican. He has a major role to play and he may also have a crowded bar and may be trying to serve everybody. This is also a public relations exercise as the information must get got out to the public at large that the legislation has been introduced. One can now say to a barman that he cannot serve a drink to a particular person, that he can be removed. The Garda can come in, whether in uniform or not, and remove him. This is the way forward and it is a great protection for the public.I welcome also the provisions dealing with under age persons. I hate to see young people around pubs. If a young person is in the pub for a long time before 8 p.m. that is at the discretion of the owner. I would tighten up that provision and say they should not be in the pub at all. If a culture is started between the ages of four to seven, it is inculcated. I invite the Minister to adopt a stronger approach on that aspect.I am opposed to the "happy hour" and the fixed charge because that is a reason for getting in and remaining in the pub for the night. At a fixed charge of, perhaps, €20 for the night, one is home and dry and one can drink all one wishes. I am pleased the Minister is about to tackle that problem.I have no difficulty with the closing time of 11.30 p.m. However, the Minister then referred to entertainment for the last half hour, before 11.30 p.m.

Section 11 deals with special exemption orders. The Bill provides that the duration of exemption orders will be determined by the local authority in consultation with the Garda and health interests. While the district justice will grant the licence, the local authority will determine the duration of special exemptions. That is rather clumsy. If there is an objection it goes back to the district justice. A role is being taken away from somebody and given to the local authority. That is not how it used to be. I wonder how it will work on the ground. I welcome the local authority having more power in that area because it will give them an opportunity to get involved and to be aware of it. I was trying to think it out and decided to float it. I am not convinced it is a good idea.I like the provision which deals with the production of evidence of age and I hope it will be implemented. That provision should be spelled out because there will be those of 25 and 26 years of age who may look 18 and they should be required to carry the evidence of age card. The Minister is doing his part well but it is a societal issue.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	122	That is the bottom line. The question is how it will be implemented. The Department of Health and Children has a role in promoting health programmes as alternatives to alcohol-related activities. Wearing my other hat, I am not convinced that the social, personal and health education programme is working. I am not sure that what young people learn in the classroom and in the education world is transferred to the outside world. How do parents link in with that programme? The Department of Education and Science has a role and will have to be incorporated into our thinking.There is also the problem of parenting supports. Often we are dealing with a dysfunctional fabric of society. Counselling is needed for those who may not be able to help the young people who are misusing alcohol. They may not be able to handle it and may have their own problems. A back up system is needed to assist them.The problem can start with students engaged in part-time work, which provides them with money. How can their leisure time be monitored? Those who employ young people have a responsibility. While this is not the Minister's area of responsibility it is all part of a bigger picture. The Minister has started and I welcome what has been done so far.I go back to what I said many months ago, that parents, irrespective of the age group of young people who may be aged from 15 up to 40, still have the guidance role for their children.

Everybody knows his or her rights but with rights there are responsibilities. If all those points could be incorporated into a future Bill, perhaps under a separate agency and a separate Minister dealing with this area, the public would be pleased.I congratulate the Minister, who is responding well to this problem. I invite him to make it known to the public that this is where we are at. The bottom line is that we have a public relations exercise. I ask him to get after the sports clubs and the drinks industry in respect of advertising and glamourising the sale of drink and what it stands for. Let us get back to a society we all love. This is a beautiful little country. Do not let it go downhill.

I feel I should oppose every section of the Bill for all kinds of reasons. No more than the Minister, I would be considered to be a libertarian in many ways and I have much difficulty with what is contained in the Bill. I am aware of the reasons for it and I welcome the fact that the Minister is responding to many issues. I am not sure all the answers are in the Bill. There are some provisions with which I have no problem.This issue should not be driven by "Prime Time" television images which suit its particular tale. Young people are no worse today than when I was young a long time ago. I could tell stories about how we, as students, spent every penny we had on drink or whatever was the particular fun at the weekend. I could tell stories of those of us who made poitín in Dublin flats and apartments. The world has not changed that much. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of hammering kids, blaming parents and so on. I will give the reason because there is an issue here.I listened very carefully to the Minister's speech and I agree there is a problem. The problem is much more in the demand area than in the supply area. This Bill deals with the supply area and that approach never works. It reminds me of the great idea which originated in Europe in the mid-1980s regarding how we might deal with the drugs problem, including cocaine – that we should convince the farmers of South America to grow carrots instead of coca plants on the basis that this would stop production. There will always be ways of getting a banned substance. If politicians have one thing in common, it is that we have ways around things. We know young people will always find a way around a constraint.Young people of today are far more responsible than my age group at their age. I have a difficulty with boundaries or limits which constrain human endeavour. I think of Parnell at the top of O'Connell Street – let no one stop the march of a nation. We get this reaction whenever one starts to impose limits.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	128	It is interesting that the point was made that SPHE, social, personal and health education, is not working. Some of us were blasted against the wall when we tried to have it introduced. Right wing elements of the churches stood in its way and are still blocking it to make sure it does not work and that people do not find out how they might run their lives.There are issues we should examine. I understand the point made about closure at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. Publicans have not done their cause any good in this regard. It was and is always possible – there was nothing in previous legislation or the Equal Status Act – to stop people from refusing drink to somebody a licensee feels should not get drink, for honest reasons. I have not seen anybody charged for this.The Equality Authority worked within the law. I get worried when I hear legislators pass the blame. It is like blaming the Garda for the law which we made. Those involved in the courts and other authorities simply put it into effect. Whether the authority should or should not have done what it did, it was the law. We said one could not discriminate against a person under a certain age and the authority decided it must be tested. When it was, it went a particular way. I did not like the outcome either because it should be right and proper for a publican to say "No" in such situations. However, I do not want to blame the authority.I have no difficulty with the Minister getting legislation through the House quickly. It is the right thing to do. I am in favour of getting it through as quickly as possible and have no difficulty with dealing with something over a couple of days. I have no difficulty either with the "burden of proof" being "a reasonable apprehension". However, I notice the Minister has used the terms "drunken", "drunk" and "drunkenness" almost synonymously, which is probably wise but I ask him to consider two issues in regard to it. Perhaps it would be worthwhile bringing forward an amendment.The interpretation of "a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger himself or herself or any other person" does not go far enough. A person could be utterly incapable, in the original definition of the words "drunk" and "incapable". The word "incapable" is important. A person in charge of a bar might decide that a person is not doing any harm to anybody but he or she might be utterly incapable. I think that word could be usefully added to the definition. It could fit. We would then have the words "a reasonable apprehension that the person is incapable and might endanger himself or herself". Will the Minister consider this?I do not understand the reason for the inclusion of the words "in the vicinity". This bothers me. Why can we not say "that would give reasonable apprehension that the person is incapable and might endanger himself or herself or any other person"? We do not need to add the words "in the vicinity". People could go home and endanger someone in the home. I do not suggest that we ask bar staff to make this judgment but the point is that we do not want this to provide a loophole.Section 4 refers to the drunken person. Like many arguments the Minister and I have had during the years, it is like arguing the ninth part of a hair on minor matters. The difference between section 4(1)(b) and 4(1)(c) is like a piece of calculus. It reminds me of something a guy said to me a long time ago about a car crash. He said, “You would go fierce close before you'd hit.” Section 4(1)(b) states a licensee shall not, on the licensed premises, “permit a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor” while section 4(1)(c) contains the words “permit drunkenness to take place in the bar”. If we take the view that at a certain point somebody becomes drunk, what we are saying is that a person should not be given a drink at the point before which he or she becomes drunk. There is an inconsistency and it is not quite clear how this will work. It should be written in a different way.It is clear in section 4(4) that the prosecution could say that "it is a defence to prove that the licensee took reasonable steps to prevent the drunkenness concerned taking place." That is better than section 4(1)(c) which is like a piece of calculus. What is the Minister's view, as a lawyer, of section 4(3) which goes close to damaging the principle of presumption of innocence? It does not quite do this but it is so close that it may have that outcome.It will not surprise the Minister to hear that the section which causes the greatest problem for me in this legislation is section 19 regarding equality legislation. Somebody said to me earlier that the Minister was looking after his own union. Effectively, this hands the issue over to the legal profession. The equality employment tribunal made the procedure informal and allowed access. The idea of somebody setting up a court case is not on. The situation is bad enough in the tribunal. I saw a case recently where there were two senior counsel, one junior counsel and a couple of solicitors involved. That was never the intention.This section will provide for a case to be brought to court. I heard the Minister's reasons for this and do not have time to go through the whole issue. It is possible to provide for gradation. The Minister has said the Equality Authority can become involved in two ways and give resources. Can he clarify this? Does it include resources to have a person represented by a lawyer in court? He did not state this.A more important question is whether it will be possible to add an extra step in this section. Could it be said the case might go to the District Court, if necessary? Could a case start off with the authority and the party against whom the complaint is made have the option of saying whether he or she wishes the case to be taken in court? That might allow some balance. It is unfair to ask a Traveller who genuinely has no malicious intent, a gay person, a woman, a disabled person etc. to bring a case to the District Court. Is it possible to include an extra step in the legislation?

People describe particular arrangements as being "the best show in town" and this Bill is one of them. In it the Minister addresses the issues of drunkenness, disorder and under age drinking, which together give us the worst show in town. We must have measures such as those proposed by the Minister to combat this. However, the Minister is doing it through more than this Bill alone. He has recently brought a series of measures before the Houses such as the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. When we debated that Bill in this House, similar issues were raised.I hear what the Opposition is saying about there not being enough time for this Bill. However, if we had gone into the summer recess, the Opposition would be screaming from the highest heaven as to how the Government could do such a thing. Therefore, the Minister's timing is apt. We must rush this legislation through for the good of all concerned.The Minister received a submission from the Irish Medical Organisation, as did I. It highlights areas which could be examined in regard to this legislation. For example, it calls on the Government to introduce measures to prohibit publicans engaging in the practice of encouraging excessive drinking. The Minister has recognised this in his speech and it is reflected in this Bill, since section 20 prohibits the sale of liquor at a reduced price. In other words, "happy hours" will now be discouraged or not allowed at all.I urge the Minister to enforce the prohibition of the presence of small children in pubs after 8 p.m. Having listened to the debate, I am inclined to suggest that we be more flexible with regard to the time limit, especially during the summer and for children who are not so young. When I am out for lunch on Sunday afternoons, I often see very small children in pubs. However, there are other age groups of children who play outside in the grounds of pubs and hotels. Perhaps we could examine this matter further, since we do not want to be spoilsports.When the Minister was before the House last month, he commended Senator Quinn for putting responsibility back on individuals. I am glad this Bill provides for the onus to be returned to the individual. Someone who is under the influence of alcohol and is asked to leave one pub should not seek to gain entry to another and, if they do so, it is an offence. I congratulate the Minister on this provision which puts the ball back in the individual's court. If I remember correctly, an Opposition Senator said that the Minister was putting too much onus on fast food outlet owners and pub licensees. However, he is now sharing this responsibility, for which I congratulate him.I am confused about the provision regarding the presence of 15 to 17 year olds in pubs. What will happen in a nightclub context in that regard? Senator Jim Walsh said drinking-up time is for doing just that and that dancing is dangerous at that stage of the night. However, as a mother of four children, I would rather my children danced during drinking-up time rather than stand knocking back as much drink as possible. Perhaps it is a female thing, but people are better off dancing. Women are softer and can encourage the men away from the bar. In any case, dancing is far more enjoyable than drinking.The Minister said there would be a broad review of the licensing laws next year. In that context, I ask him to examine nightclubs, rather than prevent dancing during drinking up time. Surely there is an onus on the licensee to provide food where there are bar extensions. I urge a return to the chicken and chips in a basket.I am glad to see that the Special Olympics is alcohol-free. I am a volunteer for the event and our orders include abstinence from alcohol or substance abuse. If they can do it, we all can. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.

#KateWalsh	unknown-#KateWalsh-party	unknown-#KateWalsh-dob	unknown-#KateWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I wish to praise my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for having the courage to bring forward this legislation. For many years, successive Ministers have vowed to tackle the problem of excessive under age drinking and failed, either because the measures enacted did not go far enough or were watered down at the behest of certain powerful interest groups. Upon taking office, the Minister pledged himself to tackle the problems and is doing so.It is ironic that he was lambasted in certain quarters of the media at the beginning of the year for failing to take action and then sharply criticised when he announced his proposals for allegedly trying to censor the nation's fun. The old adage that there is no pleasing some people is no more true than in this case. The criticism that, by trying to curb the excesses of alcohol abuse, the Minister is somehow trying to stop the nation having a good time, is an important one because it demonstrates an underlying weakness in society – that we associate alcohol with fun and enjoyment.Enjoying a drink is seen as the norm but those who do not drink are almost regarded with suspicion. Family occasions, from birthdays to weddings, christenings to funerals, all revolve around lots of alcohol. If teenagers do not drink, they are not regarded as being part of the crowd.Some of the debate in the Oireachtas in recent months appeared to treat the problem of alcohol abuse as relatively new – something that appeared alongside mobile phones and the Celtic tiger. However, we must not fool ourselves into thinking that drunkenness and the misuse of alcohol by young people are new. Our culture has always been tainted by its close, cosy relationship with alcohol.What is different now is that young people have more disposable income and there is a raft of new products with a high alcohol content available, especially targeted at youngsters. It is also the case that young people do not seem to have any difficulty getting their hands on such products. Now more than ever, the pressure seems to be on young people to be part of the crowd. This is the reason so many of them have their first drink, as I have discovered from young constituents of mine in north Kildare. They tell me it is not cool to say one does not drink. Their peers expect them to be part of that gang, which involves drinking copious amounts of alcohol. It is difficult to outlaw or legislate against peer pressure. However, we can prevent teenagers' excessive use of alcohol, which is why this Bill is so important. It aims to make it more difficult for teenagers to get served and offers greater punishments to those who serve them.The sad fact is that teenagers want to drink and get drunk. They see their parents, relatives and friends doing so. Tackling our attitude to alcohol and our own tolerance of a drink culture is a societal problem. The Government cannot force a change in attitude. However, as with the example of the successful penalty points system, deterrents and punishments can be put in place which may help to foster a change.One of the main provisions of the Bill is a bid to tackle drunkenness and excessive or binge drinking. The Bill includes revised provisions, including stronger penalties, in regard to the sale and supply of alcohol to drunk people and drunkenness in licensed premises, which I applaud. For far too long, we have tolerated drunkenness from a cultural and legal perspective. If publicans are prohibited from serving drunk people with alcohol, perhaps as a nation, we will begin to question the acceptability of getting drunk.Critics have often pointed to the situation in European countries, where French, Spanish or Italian teenagers would look aghast at one of their peers if he or she was drunk. Why do we not ask why that is not happening in Ireland? It is not the case in Ireland because teenagers see drunken adults falling in and out of pubs and clubs. As, clearly, adults see nothing wrong with it, why should young people? If people are no longer to be allowed drink in pubs when drunk, the mask of acceptability might slip. If we can change the behaviour of adults, we might perhaps change the behaviour of young people. It is unfair to criticise teenagers for drinking when we fail to show leadership or a proper example.Opposition Deputies and certain interest groups have been quick to criticise the Minister and argued that these provisions are naive, that it is impossible to stop people from getting drunk and for publicans to determine who is drunk. I thank the Minister for defying the critics and taking the initiative.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I warmly welcome the Bill and have no difficulty with the speed with which it has been introduced if its provisions will help in some way to reduce the abuse of alcohol, regardless of who is at fault. The sooner it is implemented the better. However, many aspects will be very difficult to implement because the Garda will be relied upon to enforce it. Good will goes out the door in situations of alcohol abuse. When the Minister backs up the Bill's provisions with a commitment to provide for an increased Garda presence on the ground, we will see a change in the country's attitude to the abuse of alcohol which costs the Exchequer €2.4 billion per annum, which amounts to €600 for every man, woman and child. Figures like this provide a perspective on the problem. I welcome anything the Minister can do to reduce this cost as speedily as possible.The Minister has indicated that members of the Garda Síochána will have hand-held videos at their disposal and that where it appears that licensees are responsible for people exiting their premises in a state of intoxication, they will be held responsible and face closure of their premises. That is welcome, yet many towns and villages do not have access to a member of the Garda Síochána from 5 p.m. until 9 a.m. Recently, in the west, three 999 calls by a publican who wanted help in an urgent matter were not responded to. While I recognise the Minister's difficulties and will support any measure he introduces to bring about change, the deployment of Garda forces must be quickly addressed.The Minister has suggested that there be a proliferation of café outlets from which drink may be served. That would be a recipe for disaster. If it is not possible to monitor sufficiently well the current outlets, how can additional premises be monitored? There is no point in pursuing the continental model referred to by the Minister until there is a sea change in the attitude to drink and its attendant difficulties.Section 11 is a cause of concern in terms of local authority input on the question of exemptions. The number of exemptions constitutes a scourge. While we all benefit from them when we want to organise public or private functions, they have proliferated. It is necessary to more closely define what is meant by a special occasion. Even the Judiciary will see a reason for granting rather than refusing them.All Senators received submissions from nightclub owners who want to extend closing hours to 4 a.m. Their reasons for this proposal do not stand up to scrutiny. I hope the Minister will not differentiate in this area. All licensees, including publicans and nightclub owners, must play on an even pitch. The suggestion of staggering closing times is no justification for extending closing times of nightclubs.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	There are many aspects of the Bill with which I have no difficulty because many of them are concerned with making the present law enforceable and, therefore, worth implementing. It came as a shock to us all to discover that a garda out of uniform could not observe activities in a pub to see whether people under age were being served. It was also a shock for me to discover how difficult it was to persuade the Garda that certain pubs were serving people under age. I made a speech in the House late one Thursday afternoon, which featured in "Oireachtas Report" at midnight. I said my 17 year old daughter had told me she would not dream of attending a nightclub in Cork because it was full of junior certificate students. I said I assumed that the members of the Garda Síochána who also had teenage children knew the same thing. At 8.55 a.m. the following morning I got a telephone call from a senior member of the force who told me I was giving out about the Garda. I was not. I was giving out about the lack of enforcement of the law and assumed the Garda knew what I knew. The club in question, with other nightclubs in the area, was raided the following Saturday and subsequently closed. My children never forgave me because they said it became impossible for under age teenagers to attend nightclubs.When my 23 year old daughter was 16 years of age, she told me of another nightclub serving people under age. It has now been closed for a month but I knew for seven years that it was a well known location for serving teenagers under age. Anybody with teenage children who talks to them could provide any member of the Garda Síochána with a list of the premises concerned, which varies from time to time. There is an enforcement issue, separate from Senator Ulick Burke's concern about resources. I know the Garda Síochána is under pressure and probably has a list of priorities. However, if it rigorously and consistently enforces the law on under age drinking, it will begin to deal with a number of the other problems in this area, especially if we, as legislators, support this approach.Like other Members, I have been asked to sign a pledge to undertake that I will not be photographed in public with a drink in my hand. That is an invitation to the tabloid press to catch us out. I do not have to remind the Minister of the problems associated with attending bars under various circumstances. I have refused to sign the pledge because it is ridiculous. I will not be caught with a sucker punch because I happen to have a glass in my hand when somebody takes a photograph.I am not madly keen on the prohibition on children. I spend as much of my summer as I can in the Corca Dhuibhne gaeltacht and for most of those who holiday in the area there is nowhere to go but the public house after 8 p.m. The only other places available are enormously expensive restaurants. The place where everybody on a camping site or in a holiday home goes at night if they want to stay out after 8 p.m. or until 11 p.m. is the pub. I can see what is involved and I can understand what the Minister must consider, but we should think this measure through. I am one of those who agrees with the Minister's willingness to be flexible on the 9 p.m. limit. As he said, the time varies.I wish to make a suggestion which does not apply to this Bill, but is relevant. Everybody who ends up being collected off the street by the Garda or an ambulance to be brought to a hospital to sober up should pay the entire economic cost of the process. It is an affront to have the health service pay for that in the case of people who can afford to get themselves blind drunk on a Saturday night. We should be prepared to discuss sequestering their salaries or their wages to pay the real costs they incur. I have got extremely drunk in my day but I never set out to get intoxicated. I am disturbed by the increasing tendency of a section of our young people to go out and get so drunk that the following day their boast is that they cannot remember what they did. How one can possibly enjoy oneself when the condition required to do so means one cannot remember what one did is a mystery to me. There is a cultural issue involved which goes beyond the law of the land and which we, as opinion formers and law makers in society, must address.There are aspects of the Bill about which I am not madly keen. I have a question about the "happy hour" provisions which are a little prescriptive. Many of my students will take great exception to the legislation as they enjoy the "happy hour" which many of the student orientated pubs in Cork provide.On the issue of young people, I agree to a degree with Senator O'Toole. Our young people are not that bad, but they have more money and fewer inhibitions than was the case before. I have seen no sign of excessive drinking harming them in the short term, but the scale of the drinking most of them indulge in will, by their late 20s and early 30s, do them serious physical harm and hurt society. We have a certain obligation in this regard.As I have said over and over again in this House, the matter comes down to enforcement. One of the most fundamental laws in our society is that no person under the age of 18 should have an easy way to get their hands on alcoholic drink. It is an adult pleasure which should be restricted to adults and we must ensure that distinction is made clearer and clearer.

It would be unchivalrous to suggest that it become a test of sobriety that one knows what fellow Senators are doing.I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward at this time. He is only too well aware, as other Senators have said, that there are deep cultural issues involved in this matter. It is important to see this legislation as only one of a series of instruments which we need to use. It is important also not to give the impression that we are dumping on young people who are only doing what we teach them to aspire to do. It is the adults in society who set the cultural norms. Theirs is the cycle we must break. There is not a great deal of logic in talking about introducing continental mores to Ireland while that culture remains.I grew up in a public house and I probably kept within the bounds of the law. I am only too well aware of a number of the issues the Minister raised. To echo a point made by Senator Ulick Burke, enormous responsibility is put on the licensee, which is proper, but that licensee is then entitled to be assured of the support of the Garda. Some of the cases which arise will be very difficult for licensees to deal with. Given the ubiquity of hand-held video, I wonder if it is possible to encourage pubs to install closed circuit television and to use the evidence from it.I would also like to see a slightly more relaxed attitude to children. I understand what we are trying to do, but within the Minister's proposal there is the germ of a possibility of making parts of a premises family friendly. I am glad to see the Minister has defined the "bar" and the place where alcohol is openly on sale. The more he can do to ensure that children can come to the pub to be with their parents in the evening, particularly in country areas and holiday towns, the better. Publicans should be encouraged to provide pool rooms away from the point of sale.I ask the Minister to consider the matter of the 100 metre limit which seems to be fraught with difficulty. We all remember what used to be called "bona fide houses". If one could travel three miles, one could become a bona fide drinker in a ring of pubs. One could see a series of places being established 101 metres from an outlet. Will the Minister consider what has been done in the North where a local authority can declare parts of its area to be places in which it is not permissible to drink publicly? The measure has been quite effective. I commend the general thrust of the Bill and I wish the Minister well with it.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I thank Senator Maurice Hayes for sharing his time with me.I wish first of all to gain a few SuperClub points. Senator Quinn says he has spoken to the Minister about the issue, but I raise it to place it in on the record of the House. Senator Quinn is concerned about section 21(1)(b) of the Bill which provides that a seller must affix to any container containing intoxicating liquor to be sold off the premises a label which indicates where it was purchased. Senator Quinn feels this would be extremely time consuming and costly to implement while not having a very great beneficial effect. He suggests that only an off-licence which has already been in trouble should be made to put particulars on the alcohol it sells.I agree with Senators Kate Walsh and Maurice Hayes who both said we must not regard this as an issue which involves only young people. Unfortunately, the issue involves everybody. We have developed an incredible alcohol culture.If there is one group of people the Minister will have acquired as supporters, it is the accident and emergency consultants who came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children to tell the most appalling tales. I have mentioned some of those in the House previously, but there were other points raised in that forum which are worth following upI am not sure how effective section 6, which relates to drunken persons, will be. It is very prohibitive in terms of asking licensees to take actions which will be detrimental to their living. I would have thought it was possible to get these drunken people involved with health professionals. If they have had two fines, is it not reasonable for us to send them to see alcohol specialist nurses? It seems useless simply to fine them and dump them out of the system.Senator Ryan has said he does not think young people are doing themselves much harm in the short term but they are. They are killing their neurons at a tremendous rate. Gastroenterologists have told me of encountering cirrhosis of the liver in women in their late 20s and early 30s. This problem was unknown until recently. This issue should be addressed. Imposing fines is not enough. More is needed.The Minister is right to concentrate on clubs and late night venues. The most common mode of transport to hospital from a nightclub is by ambulance. Guess what that is costing the State. A considerable number of people go to hospital because assault is extraordinarily common outside these emporia. It would be a good idea to consider less aesthetic options such as the provision of unbreakable glass or plastic containers, the elimination of glass outside clubs, the provision of high quality and immediate medical care at larger venues, curbing overcrowding and happy hours, which cause dreadful problems, and better registration of doormen. Nightclub owners, brewers, distillers and so forth should have to pay for these.A large number of people working in accident and emergency departments are injured as a result of alcohol. Senator O'Toole correctly pointed out that the drunkenness can endanger more people than those in the drunk's vicinity. This point should be taken on board because if the drunk gets so bad that he or she is carted off to hospital, he or she can end up beating up the casualty staff. A survey carried out by the accident and emergency departments in the Royal Victoria Hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland received 273 replies to a questionnaire, an 80% response rate. Alcohol, waiting times, recreational drug use and patients' expectations were perceived as the chief causes of assaults in casualty departments. Staff are regularly abused both verbally and physically and the survey found that alcohol was the most serious cause. Ten staff members sustained fractures in one year. There were 44 lacerations and 505 soft tissue injuries. This is utterly ridiculous. I would support any measures that would improve matters in this regard.I do not know if the Minister is willing to accept amendments to the Bill but I am considering tabling an amendment with regard to alcohol prevention nurses. Simply imposing fines on people for being drunk is pointless because the same people will continuously come before the courts and paying €300 or €500 will not affect them. We want them to stop the bad behaviour.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I thank the Minister for initiating this Bill in the Seanad. When he said he was drafting it, Senator Terry and I invited him to initiate it here and are pleased he has done so. I listened to the debate throughout the afternoon and was struck by how every Member spoke so freely, openly and knowledgeably. That is not to imply a knowledge of being intoxicated but a knowledge of society and how it operates. It was a well attended debate which is hugely heartening and preferable to Members dashing in and out of the House without listening to others.The Bill is part of an ongoing search for solutions, both in the legislation and through a change in society and culture. It is as if we are on the first mile of a journey which could bring us in many directions but, I hope, will lead to a greater appreciation of the proper role of alcohol use in a fair and balanced society. It is incorrect to expect the Bill to solve the problem and the Minister never asked that it be viewed in that way. However, it is part of what will, I hope, be a rounded response to many issues. Society has suffered ills throughout the centuries and can never be completely tranquil. However, we owe it to the people to ensure everything possible is done to tackle the abuse of alcohol.There is a growing and worrying tendency to opt for prohibition. The attitude is that drink is bad. Therefore, let us do the same about it as the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is doing about tobacco. They are two different commodities. Cigarettes injure one's health but drink does not, unless an excessive amount is taken. It can be taken in proper moderation. I agree that the happy hour is a most unhappy experience. The happy hour is followed by another happy hour in which one pays full price for drink which is followed by a third, most unhappy, hour until it all disintegrates into mayhem. Happy hours are a stupid marketing exercise to get young people tanked up and quickly into a state of oblivion. I also agree with Senator Ryan. Why should one wish to boast the next day that one cannot remember what happened the previous night, who one met, what one said or did or where one was? If that is enjoyment, what a pitiful experience it is.Irish people are gregarious by nature. I have never met an Irish person who actually sits silently at home and gets drunk. Irish people like to go out for company and meet people in a gregarious atmosphere. That is fine if it can be controlled. The Bill is not an exercise in bashing the youth. However, the sensibilities of youth and their health are not really ready for the onslaught caused by an excess of liquor. As one gets older, one quickly realises that it is not really the great experience it is reputed to be. The enjoyment is knocked out of it. A glass of wine with a meal or a drink with friends can be enjoyable. There is a need for cultural change.I grew up in a pub. When I came home after my first year in college, I was told I was old enough to serve in the pub and that was my lot for the following three months. However, it is where my husband first saw me. Therefore, I should be glad of it.

I agree with the Minister's ideas about tapas bars and so forth, even if others have derided them. However, we have to reach the point where it will be possible to go out to small eateries and enjoy a glass of alcohol with one's food. There is a long way to go before we reach that point.I thank the Minister. He has been a friend of this House and we look forward to receiving more Bills from the Department.

One can have all the laws one likes but if they are not enforced, they are window dressing. If a law is to be enforceable, it must be one that works. Gardaí were confronted with a situation where they had to be in uniform to detect an offence. Sixteen and 17 year olds were able to spend all night in a pub drinking minerals and/or alcopops and unless a garda could work out whose drink was whose when he or she went into the premises, he or she could not prove any offence. Age cards were voluntary and publicans who sought them risked their business going to other pubs in the town.There is a combination here of having an enforceable law and then asking the Garda Síochána to enforce it. I strongly maintain that we must have a tough enough approach to the enforcement of our laws. I do not agree with everything the Americans do, and sometimes in relation to matters legal and penal they are a bit retributive and unforgiving. However, their age limits on alcohol are tough and under age people do not get drink in America. People do not break the law and serve people under age because their premises will be closed. We, however, are inclined to give people a few chances and take a soft view on the law.If we are serious about under age drinking – which we should be – we should have a law that is workable. This does not just apply to 16 and 17 year olds. We are talking about protecting young girls in the 18 to 25 age group from being found helpless on the street outside a super pub, not knowing when they get to the casualty unit whether they were sexually assaulted or not – and not because of rohypnol but massive indulgence in alcohol. We are talking about protecting lives from being ruined. We are talking about young men who get into fights and give each other a thump in the jaw, suddenly leading to brain damage because of one of them hits his head off a pavement.We are talking about many lives which can be blighted from a completely ravenous approach to alcohol, which some of our counter-culture seems to be selling at the moment as cool. I do not want to get into moralistic mode because, frankly, I like drink and have no problem with people drinking. I do not want to get overly-moralistic, but when a group of publicans came to me about this legislation, one of them described how, in some premises, a regular form of drink ordered is a pint glass with two Bacardi Breezers and one or two shots added to strengthen it. That is sold with ice to teenagers. It is an almost lethal combination. If those things are being served to youngsters in pubs, it is no wonder that they get into serious difficulties with alcohol very quickly.I agree completely with Senator O'Toole that this generation is not fatally flawed in a way that our generation was not. However, one thing that did hold us back – Senator O'Toole more or less than myself – was the absence of money—

I ask Members to bear in mind that prohibition applies to kids in the bar of a premises. Anybody who wants to serve meals in their premises or to readjust a room so that parents can have pints, spirits or whatever while the kids have Club Oranges can do so. This is not draconian law. Likewise, in a hotel, a function room which is not primarily used for sale of alcohol is not a bar, so the family wedding is not covered by this. With a bit of creativity, the licensed trade should be able to adapt to these new requirements and we should not damage our way of life.I agree completely that we do not want to go into prohibition mode. Nearly everybody here is old enough to remember a time when one could leave the key in the door and life was easy and so on. Alcohol was still a scourge, though, and as Senator Kate Walsh said, there is no point in pretending that alcohol and alcoholic problems are phenomena which suddenly landed upon us in the era of mobile phones. Alcohol always was a scourge in its own way.However, we now have to bear in mind that we are in a much more liberal society, which I welcome. Our kids are much less inhibited, which I also welcome. The authority structures in our society are changing. Social morality has not gone but it is changing. Compared with the past, respect for authority figures has disappeared. In those circumstances we have to adapt.I have no doubt that this legislation is demanded by the people and is, roughly speaking, what the people want. I apologise to the House if the Bill appears to be rushed but I did engage in debate. I was accused of flying kites; I made speeches and attended generalised debates in this House on the subject; and I brought the Bill to the Oireachtas joint committee, where both Senators and Deputies could discuss the principle before I committed myself to the detail of it. I am sensitive, like everybody else, to a little bit of abuse, and those who questioned whether I would walk the walk as well as talk the talk have their answer today.I thank the House for assisting me in bringing forward very useful legislation. It is not a question of rivalry between Government and Opposition. It is what the people, collectively, are looking to this House to do and I thank the House for its most generous, considered, erudite and, on occasion, light-hearted consideration of this very serious issue.

Financing of politics by big business in recent years has been the cause of major controversy. We need only look at what happened in Dublin Castle over the last number of years, and we all know now the extent to which politics and business was inextricably linked. That in itself did a disservice to the body politic and a gross disservice to the reputations of politicians. The vast majority of them have been good, honourable and decent people but the minority who were responsible for the dirt and filth which emanated from the tribunals taught us all a very valuable lesson.The Standards in Public Office Commission has done extraordinary work in recent years. It trawled through almost 9,000 pages of documents and 200,000 invoices while its secretariat was most helpful to anybody who contacted it about his or her declarations before and after the general election. Its representatives travelled around the country to meet candidates and agents who may have had difficulty with their declarations. It would be remiss of us not to mention the amount of hard work the secretariat did on this issue.The Electoral Act 1997 was designed to place limits on spending by politicians and political parties at election time and also established disclosure limits for political donations. The spirit of the Act was indicative of a culture at the time whereby people could spend endlessly. It introduced a monetary element into a campaign which was unfair and, in many quarters, unacceptable to reasonable people. That is the reason this legislation was introduced. Unfortunately, over two or three years ago the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, ably supported by his Progressive Democrats partners in government, increased the amount of money a candidate could spend by up to almost 50% in some cases in their electoral areas and raised the disclosure limits on corporate donations. This could suit only Fianna Fáil as a political organisation which at election time has a significant advantage over its opponents due to its ability to extract funding from the corporate sector. This highlights its ability to attract donations. In the light of this one does not have to wonder why there is a hospitality tent erected at the Galway races to pay financial homage to the largest political party. The marquee goes up, those who run it tout and then expect others to pour in. This is where much of the money is raised.This type of spending, extravagance and exorbitance does not apply to all parties. It is exclusive to Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach has played a consistent role on the issue, ducking, dodging, avoiding, stopping off for the quick photo call and the wink at the photographers but never staying around long enough to answer questions in detail about this very serious matter. The Government has seized the report by the SPOC in a sinister way to mandate it to change existing limits. The report does not allow or mandate the Government to reform spending limits. It more or less highlights the converse.The Taoiseach's assertion last week that wealthy candidates and millionaires could have unlimited funds in advance of an election is bizarre, to say the least, given that when Deputy Noel Dempsey was Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he blocked attempts by the SPOC to include all pre-election expenditure and related activity under the Act. This was an issue that received a lot of attention at the time. The Government refused point blank to look at the situation as would have been required by the SPOC at that stage. We all know the consequences. Only the expenditure incurred following the dissolution of the Dáil was taken into account which allowed Fianna Fáil, and its leader in particular, to invest in selling a flawed message to the electorate.In most large population centres, drapes on buildings showed us the adorable face of the Taoiseach and that now infamous phrase, "A lot done, more to do". This type of electioneering is expensive. The Government refused to include expenditure in the period up to the calling of the general election as it knew full well the advantages available to it as the Government whose prerogative it is to call an election. Only the Government and the Taoiseach knew the date and were thus able to exploit this advantage to the full with mass leaflet drops, advertising in the newspapers, on drapes, posters and billboards, and not one brown cent had to be accounted for. That is an interesting aspect of the last general election. Everybody, everywhere, knew that the Government took full advantage of that knowledge.The SPOC knew that this did not make any sense and at an early stage stated there was a difficulty because it seemed that some Dáil candidates were distributing literature in advance of the general election being called and did not have to account for it. That was wrong. At that stage the then Attorney General, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, and the then Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, advised that there would be no change in the law. This demonstrates an arrogance that could come only from a Government which exploited its position to the full. It could come only from an organisation as large as Fianna Fáil which depends so heavily on the corporate sector to finance its electioneering.The report tells us that in all 56 candidates exceeded the limit. By any standards, this was not a great surprise and did not raise many eyebrows because the Supreme Court judgment, which came as a result of an action taken by defeated general election candidate Mr. Des Kelly, arrived so late that campaigning proper had probably ceased as it was one or two days before polling day. Since publication of the report the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has signalled his intention to overhaul election spending limits. He has said he wants a fully transparent and accountable system that would be clearer, more concise and easily understood by all. He also says there are complexities in the current system. One does not need to be an Einstein or a rocket scientist to know that the only complexities in the current system are that Fianna Fáil is excluded from spending over the prescribed limits. It has to operate within the same parameters as every other political party but that does not suit because it does not want to stop at the prescribed limits. It wants to spend, spend, spend.Last year one of the disappointing elements of the campaign was the auction politics which the Taoiseach and the Government introduced creating a new low in Irish politics. One of the hallmarks of Fianna Fáil electioneering then is now inscribed in the annals: buy people's votes. That was a major part of the election strategy: spend money, taxpayer's money in many areas, as much as it could raise because it was the only party with the ability to raise it, and then insult the electorate by attempting to purchase votes. That is sinister and disingenuous because last year, as we all know now with the benefit of hindsight, the money was spent on a manifesto founded on a tissue of lies. The full extent of those lies is being felt on a daily basis as almost every week there is a mini-budget telling us where the next cuts will be, the next hospital that will have to close beds. The people in power originated this and put a price on democracy, something that cannot be measured.That is what the Government did last year: it put a price on electioneering, thereby putting a value on democracy, which is priceless, to pursue a campaign based on the philosophy that the more that was spent, the more votes were bought and the more the people were fooled. One of the most bizarre comments on the SPOC report has to be the Taoiseach's remark that "the system at the moment is designed to make sure that in the years ahead the House will be full of millionaires and that is a bad system." Most know that is not the case. Last year's system ensured only parties supported by millionaires would do well and the party with a reputation for support from those millionaires is Fianna Fáil. This endorses what the Labour Party and other Oppostion parties have been saying, that Fianna Fáil is the only party with the ability to attract this type of funding.Looking at the report of the SPOC one reaches the conclusion that an average of €33,380 was spent on each Fianna Fáil candidate, a large sum by any standards. It must be a great source of pain to the Taoiseach and his allies in government when there is talk about real transparency and accountability in how we spend money during elections but principally in the period leading up to the calling of an election because the Government has to be aware that it is making a mockery of the Act.It must also be stated that the Electoral Act 1997 has been chipped and carved away at since the Government, in its previous incarnation, took office in that year. That is pathetic and also grossly unfair. The people who expect good politicians and accountable and transparent political institutions deserve better than this. I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Cullen, to retain the current limits and, furthermore, to introduce legislation to regulate expenditure in the period leading up to a general election. It is absolutely vital that this period be taken into consideration because, it is not, the current system would be allowed to prevail. That is not right because people are making a mockery of the Act. Faith and public confidence in the political system are vital and of paramount importance to the body politic. The Government should show a good example.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I am happy to second this motion on an issue of fundamental importance to our democracy, namely, how we organise ourselves, our political parties and our elections, which are the very cornerstone of our system. It is clear that the relationship between business and politics is, if anything, being strengthened by the attitude and actions of Fianna Fáil, in particular, in the current Administration. Fianna Fáil's response to the report of the Standards in Public Offices Commission last week and to the Des Kelly court action shows that it has not only learned nothing from what has happened in the past ten to 15 years in public discourse, but that it intends to remain as arrogant as ever and ensure that its relationship with business remains and, if anything, becomes stronger.It was my great privilege to work with the former Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, who introduced the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and later the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Electoral Act 1997 were the first parts of a framework of legislation designed to modernise our democracy and put a fundamental principle at its heart, namely, to protect it and to break a link – in the public mind and in reality – between business and politics.Even before the tribunals had uncovered the full extent of the relationship between business and politics, it was evident that the link between the two would have to be broken because the relationship to which I refer was having a negative effect not only on the political system but also on public confidence in it and on the public perception of political decisions, particularly those made by the Government and its Ministers. There appeared to be widespread agreement at the time that there should be a clear separation between business and politics in order to sanitise decisions. In this way, the public could have clearly seen that – in terms of the transparency of decisions guaranteed by the Freedom of Information Act 1997 – a decision had not been influenced by any interest that a Minister might have or any representation made to him or her.We thought that being able to list the donations that a Minister or any other public representative were receiving and their details of their interests might be sufficient. However, my view on that matter has changed. It is not enough to know that a politician has certain interests or to be aware of the details regarding any donations he or she might receive. It is more important to ensure that, for example, political donations are not being made to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has power to make decisions, wield influence and introduce legislation. In the past year, the Minister declared a very high level of donations – the highest, I believe, of any Cabinet member. He received donations from, for example, Sisks and other companies in the construction sector in the same year that he changed the social housing provisions of the Planning Act as a result of lobbying carried out by the building industry. I was concerned about that because, in the public mind, questions are bound to be raised about whether the Minister was influenced by the donations he received. Why would a business, a company or an individual make a donation of large amounts of money to a political party or to an individual politician?The argument has been put forward that big business wants to protect and support our democracy, but it just does not stand up to scrutiny. It is clear that any big company making a donation to a Minister does so to gain access to or lobby them and obtain a favourable response. That is why the tent at the Galway races and the Taoiseach's annual fundraising dinners are so well attended. It is because he is the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil are in power. Business interests want to be close to those in power so that, when decisions affecting them are being made, they have the inside track because their donations place them in a favourable position. That is fundamentally wrong; it makes our democracy rotten and totally undermines the independence of decision-making. The Minister can come and swear black and blue that he is not influenced by whatever donations he might receive, but the public will simply not believe that. To use a common phrase, he who pays the piper calls the tune.My second point concerns something the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said last week in response to the report and the issues arising from it. He stated that the Labour Party wants the taxpayer to fund the political system. I have two things to say in regard to that matter. First, in case the Minister had not noticed, the taxpayer already funds the political system. Taxpayers fund our salaries, expenses, office allowances and so on, and that is a very fundamental part of our democracy. It is a good thing. Ultimately, the taxpayer is the voter and, in the interests of transparency and accountability, taxpayers should be able to see what we public representatives spend of their money. Under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, they are fully able to do so. I always welcome the publication of such information, because members of the public are entitled to know how their money is being spent.The Minister seemed to be suggesting that the huge donation Fianna Fáil received and the huge amount that it spent on the most recent election would somehow be coming from the taxpayer. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fianna Fáil splurged massive amounts of money in the run-up to the election from the donations that it had received. It would be far better and healthier to have a legislative framework where only the taxpayer paid for the election and the run-up to it, controlling everything in that context. There should be a ban on political donations. Unless such a ban is introduced, there will always be questions in the public mind about who is the piper, who is paying him and who is really calling the tune.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann," and substitute the following:"notes(i) the Standards in Public Office Commission's report of 11 June, 2003 on Election Expenses Statements and Statutory Declarations received from election agents of candidates, national agents of political parties and other persons at the Dáil General Election held on 17 May 2002;(ii) that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government awaits the views of the Chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission in relation to the operation of the Electoral Act 1997 (as amended); and(iii) that the Minister intends to review the provisions of the Electoral Act 1997 with a view to maintaining a fully transparent and accountable system which will be clearer, more concise and more easily understood in the interests of the public, candidates at elections and political parties."I join Senators McCarthy and O'Meara in commending the work of the Standards in Public Office Commission. I have been in contact with that office which has been very helpful to Members of both Houses, particularly those who were candidates in recent elections.In recent days the commission released figures on expenditure by candidates during the 2002 general election. At first glance it appears that some candidates, including me, spent more on their campaigns than they were entitled to but there is a clear explanation for this which relates directly to the findings of the High Court on 16 May 2002, the day before the election. The High Court overturned the guidelines for what could be deemed an election expense but the judgment was delivered on the eve of the election, by which time campaigns were concluding.The judgment related in the main to expenses arising from any service or facility provided for me by virtue of the fact that I was an elected representative. This is true of other Members also. Prior to the judgment, candidates from all parties and their election agents were entitled to assume that the rules on spending were as set out in the relevant legislation and reflected in the guidelines published by the commission. Any overspending in my case – I was €1,500 over the limit – was inadvertent. There was no wilful act on my part which could be interpreted as not being in compliance with the guidelines until the High Court judgment on the eve of the poll. On that basis, no overrun could have been foreseen by me or the commission, a position it accepts entirelyThe 2002 general election was the first to be conducted with full financial disclosure by candidates. The confidence this provides for the electorate is an essential safeguard for our democracy and legislates for public affairs in Ireland being conducted in an open way. However, it is now clear that problems have arisen with the complexity of existing legislative provisions in this area. The commission report refers to a number of these complexities, with practical difficulties being experienced by candidates and political parties in attempting to comply conscientiously with the legislation's requirements. Against this background, I welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated his intention to review the present system in order to improve its transparency and simplicity. Broadly based consultation involving all political parties and colleagues on these matters is desirable. This is being initiated.Public understanding of the electoral system is paramount. We need to provide a fully transparent and accountable system which will be clearer, more concise and easily understood for the benefit of the public, candidates and parties. The guidelines laid down by the commission were very clear to us as they stated that any payment, service or facility provided for a person out of public funds or moneys provided by an institution of the European Community or other intergovernmental organisation to which the State was a party, pursuant to specified legislation, by virtue of the person being a representative in the European Parliament, a Member of the Dáil or Seanad, the holder of a qualifying office or position, the holder of an elected or other public office or a member of, delegate to or representative in a body established by or under an agreement or arrangement to which the State is a party, was not an election expense. The guidelines also stated the free postal service was not deemed to be an election expense in the May 2002 general election.The High Court judgment which overturned the guidelines on what could be deemed an election expense was delivered on 16 May 2002, on the eve of the general election, by which time candidates' campaigns were concluding. The commission clearly stated it would not be appropriate to refer a file to the Director of Public Prosecution where, specifically as a result of the judgment, it was found that an overspend had occurred during the general election. In arriving at this decision it had regard for the fact that the High Court decision was delivered on 16 May, the last day of the campaign. Prior to this, agents and candidates were entitled to assume that the rules on spending were as set out in the relevant legislation and reflected in the guidelines published by the commission.In making its decision the commission was mindful of the fact that it was a defence against prosecution for overspending that a person could not reasonably have known that he or she had incurred election expenses above the statutory limit. It decided that if an overspend was incurred specifically as a result of the judgment, it would not be recommending to the Minister for Finance that the amount of the overspend should be deducted from the reimbursement of election expenses payable to the candidate or from the Exchequer funding payable to the political party.Senator McCarthy referred to the guidelines laid down. The limits are €25,394.76 in a three seat constituency, €31,743.45 in a four seat constituency and €38,092.14 in a five seat constituency. I speak for many colleagues when I say have no problem with these limits. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would have more than one candidate in each constituency – it would be unusual for Fianna Fáil to have just one candidate like other parties such as the Labour Party. Although the limits are acceptable to me, this is still a difficult situation. A candidate can mention running mates on his or her poster and vice versa. As such, one is supposed to account for this in the financial returns for what it is worth. The work of an agent can also cause problems as generally in Fianna Fáil as there is one agent for three candidates. If a candidate spends money the agent does not know about, there may be problems in getting the figures on paper for the commission. We should look at this situation.I am glad with the Minister's comments on transparency and openness and agree with Senators McCarthy and O'Meara that this should not just be an issue during a campaign. We should look at the whole period a Government is in office, one to four years, and examine spending during it. We should not confine spending limits to the three or four weeks of an election campaign.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I welcome the Minister of State. How many times since the last general election have I heard that the Government essentially bought it on promises? The instances are impossible to count. Time and again we hear of cuts in education, health, disabled grants and services and housing grants. It never stops, although we were assured prior to the election that there would be no cutbacks.I have evidence from the literature distributed by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates, from Cork to Donegal and Galway to Dublin, including my county of Longford, stating there would be no cutbacks. Members will agree that moral responsibility should come with such promises. If the Government had a vestige of moral responsibility, the country would not be in the mess it is in today.The Minister for Health and Children has a moral obligation to the sick and to people dying on trolleys, for whom there should be hospital places. Where are the 300 beds he promised in his health strategy document, which was launched two years ago with a great deal of hullabaloo? They are, I presume, hidden from view in the increasing number of closed wards. The Minister also has a moral obligation to the disabled and to the elderly.What about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's moral obligation as crime on our streets – which are becoming increasingly dangerous no-go areas for citizens and tourists – rises to crisis levels?The Minister for Education and Science has a moral obligation to children and students to provide them with safe buildings. Look at what happened in Limerick last week. Similar disasters are waiting to happen in several other counties.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I could go on and on about the fact that promises bought the election. That those promises have been repeatedly broken is well known and well documented. However, broken promises backfire and the ensuing reality is there for everyone to see.Such transparency is self-perpetuating, but in the area of election spending, despite commendable and tireless work by the Standards in Public Office Commission, the complete picture in respect of the amount spent in what is known to have been the most expensive general election ever will never be revealed. That begs the question as to whether buying votes will ever be acceptable, the answer to which is negative. It leads us to the harsh reality of financial input into an election needing to be strictly regulated. Money is undoubtedly the key to election success, but, when it comes to the weight which tips the balance, it is time to address the situation as a matter of urgency. It comes as no surprise that the Government, in planning to overhaul electoral spending, proposes to increase the limits rather than place stronger controls and stricter limits on the amounts that may be spent before and during an election campaign.With or without freedom of information – without is more probably the case – we know that the €9.24 million spent in the lead-up to last year's general election only refers to the three weeks prior to its being held. Even then, we are told that 56 candidates, including the Taoiseach, breached spending limits and broke the laws of the land. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen – I wish he was here this evening – who topped the list of political donations in 2002, said that, on one hand, he wants a fully transparent and accountable system, while, on the other, he is on record as wanting to scrap spending limits during election campaigns. What accountability would there be then?The same Minister had a 12 page election document floated in his constituency six months before the general election.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	As far as Senator Kitt is concerned, I have no intention of sending around a hat this evening.Limits on electoral spending were first put in place to counter any perceived notion that elections could, in any way, be bought. The input into politics of huge donations from business to political parties in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s became a cause of concern. The original Electoral Act was introduced in 1997 by the rainbow coalition in an attempt to create a more even system and to prevent candidates from buying their way into the Dáil. Whether by promises or with the assistance of excessive financial backing, it is undoubtedly possible to buy votes.With the possibility of parties with excessive amounts of money at their disposal bypassing legislation and spending vast sums of money before an election has even been declared, it is imperative that controls are tightened. It is also important to emphasise that there is no case for increasing the already more than generous amounts which candidates are permitted to spend. With Fianna Fáil purportedly spending at least as much in the three months before the Dáil was dissolved in April 2002 as it declared for the campaign itself, it appears that the party has no need for increased limits but that it rather needs to put its house and that of others in order. Otherwise, in the Taoiseach's words and as Senator McCarthy stated, the Dáil will be full of millionaires who, in my opinion, will have bought their way in on the back of ever-increasing financial donations.Last year's general election was the second to have taken place since the introduction of the Electoral Act 1997. It was, however, the first election to which the full provisions of the Act were applied. These relate to disclosure and limitation of donations and the limitation, disclosure and reimbursement of election expenses.Over a number of years, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has, one assumes in its own interest, continually attempted to erode the provisions of the Electoral Act 1997. The former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, increased the amount that could be spent by candidates by 45%, while raising the limits for corporate donations. He also prevented the Standards in Public Office Commission from including pre-election spending under the Act. Subsequently, only expenditure following the dissolution of the Dáil was considered and this led to a financial power-base influencing the election. In other words, there is big money out there which is buying elections.When the going got tough and the Government began to feel the heat, it shamelessly railroaded through changes to the Freedom of Information Act. Is it now to be permitted to scrap the accountability of properly structured election spending limits under the guise of reform?When will people have had enough? This Government's record of manipulation and duplicity is well known and documented, but it still continues to escaped retribution. Are we now to ignore the lack of need to increase the already generous spending limits and open the door further to candidates wishing to buy their way into power? We must obey the principles of the 1997 Act and ensure fair play for all who wish to become involved in politics. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, with their millionaire financial backers, were never happy with this Act and the amendment to the motion is further evidence that they are doing their utmost to undermine its future. I reject the amendment and support the motion.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I put on record the Government's appreciation of the work of the Standards in Public Office Commission in compiling and publishing the recent report on expenses for last year's general election. The commission produced a thorough report and has carried out its job in accordance with its mandate.I will not go into the history of Electoral Acts and electoral expenses, but it is important to mention that there were limits up to 1963. The provisions in the 1997 Act were more detailed in terms of requirements demanded of candidates, elected Members and political parties. It was inevitable that difficulties would arise in the operation of its provisions because everyone involved was on a learning curve in implementing its various requirements. It is now time to review the Act due to experience gained to date in its operation, particularly as it is perceived by most that said operation has become excessively cumbersome and technical and now imposes a far greater burden of compliance than originally anticipated.I welcome the opportunity to come before the House to contribute to the debate and to listen to the views of Senators. At least Labour Party Members addressed the issue as they see it, but they are living in a different world to that in which I live. I do not quite understand this talk about huge money. I do not know whether they believe it themselves. It sounds good and they give the impression that they have rehearsed it. The important thing is the amount of money spent and where it comes from. I do not know about all this money from the corporate sector. I must go down to the Galway races some year, for the first time in my life, just to see what it is all about as I hear so many references to it.One of the things that amuses me is that other political parties pretend they go through elections spending a fraction of what some of us might spend, yet on the ground one always feels they are outspending. Maybe it is the fact that I usually use trade union printers and possibly others do not. I always find it difficult to understand how some people seem to have every lamp-post cluttered and every letterbox stuffed, yet on paper they are spending so little, where the same people are ridiculing me for spending what is largely my own money. It amuses me.I saw one article written by a journalist at the weekend who was complaining about the fortune in private money being spent. The vast majority of what they call private money is candidates' own money. That is certainly the way in my party. Anything I get is in my election account, which is not too much, but I am sure it is the same in other parties. We should really have some sense and work together instead of going on with this nonsense about huge corporate involvement. This is not the real world that most of us understand.If we ever get to the perfect world that Senators would like where everything is measured and everything is laid down, they will find that some of us operate in different ways. In canvassing and raising one's profile in the constituency it is not all about money. As a backbencher until last year I often felt aggrieved that other people seemed to get enormous publicity. It is impossible to turn on the television or radio without hearing or seeing certain candidates in the Senators' party, perhaps including their current leader.

The different ways that we raise our profiles or canvass will all have to be measured. It is not a perfect world. Then we will have to start analysing who is a friend of what media person or who is a drinking friend and who is not. Some people seem to get enormous publicity. Other people have to work for it and pay for it themselves. If we want equality, in the Senators' definition, it might branch out into certain areas they might not be thinking of.The Government is committed to full and open accountability in disclosure of political donations and election expenses. Public confidence in the electoral system is paramount. The goal of the review is to secure a fully transparent and accountable system, which will be clearer, more concise and more easily understood for the benefit of the public, candidates at election time and political parties. That is what we should all centre on. Since we are to have a review, parties and politicians should stop making political points and stop talking about hospitals and other matters when we have the opportunity to focus on what is good for us as a profession. We should try to make rules and regulations that are sensible in enabling us to communicate and disseminate information to our constituents. There are a few areas in which I would welcome the views of Senators. If not tonight, maybe in the future, Senators might focus on the real issues at hand.The all-embracing definition of a political party, especially the inclusion of branches, has created difficulties, particularly for the larger parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, due to the structure of those parties. Branches may be quite independent in some ways, with no reporting arrangements to party headquarters. A difficulty in regard to the disclosure of multiple donations from the same donor was covered by an amendment to the Act in 1998, which put the disclosure requirement on the multiple donor. However, there is a separate difficulty with the maximum permitted donation of €6,348.69, as it includes the aggregation of smaller amounts to any element of the party. Headquarters are required to put administrative procedures in place to ascertain if the aggregation of donations from one source in a year exceeds the €6,348.69 limit.A second area, which I suggest might be reviewed, concerns the requirements relating to political donation accounts. An amendment to the 1997 Act made in 2001 provided that a member of either House of the Oireachtas, an MEP, a candidate at a Dáil, Seanad or European elecion, a political party, a third party engaged in political activity or an accounting unit who or which receives, in any particular year, a monetary donation of €126.97 shall open and maintain a separate political donation account in a financial institution. We all know the procedures on that which have become rather cumbersome. It makes perfect sense when there are big contributions going in, but we now have to start recording, which creates a lot of paperwork. If someone gives you €20 it has to be recorded. That has become ridiculously complicated. It has got away from the original idea of what we were all trying to do. We should reconsider all this fuss of trying to get bank statements. The bank statement I put in this year was sent back because it was not made out by the bank in accordance with the law, etc. The date was not properly shown, or some fiddle faddle. These things were all well intended and are fine if one is lodging thousands of pounds, but when one is only getting something petty, that whole area needs to be reviewed.A third area is the donation disclosure limits which have not been changed since 1997. The real value has decreased in the intervening years with the CPI increasing by over 20% in the period. Also, the maximum permitted donation limits may require review, especially when there is more than one national poll in a year. For instance, a second national election might be required soon after an inconclusive general election or a referendum in the same year as a general election.There was no political consensus for the election expenses regime introduced in the 1997 Electoral Act. If there had been consensus, then the detailed legislative requirements and other provisions to ensure compliance might not have been necessary. The present regime is too technical and bureaucratic. A good example of this was the need for the commission to issue a 58 page book of guidelines at the 2002 general election. Then we found out the day before the election that the guidelines were wrong, according to the interpretation of the court. It was a good idea in principle to try to control what was spent and to see where it came from, but we really ought to talk sense and stop having this sort of nonsense, game playing and stupidity. We should address the problem and see what we can do about it. I am not surprised that people exceeded the limits. Maybe I should not make any admission but I do not know if anyone in the country ever fully read the 58 pages of guidelines. The whole thing is ridiculous.There are three other areas which need review following last week's publication of the 2002 general election expenditure. The 1997 Act provided for all election expenses incurred at any time before the issue of the writ. Are we to measure what is spent in the three weeks of an election campaign or a longer period? In the UK they regard the period of expenditure control as lasting for 365 days. It is a case of how we do it. It would be wrong just to measure expenditure on leaflets and to ignore other people's exposure through airtime or whatever. There is a whole area to be looked at. The rule needs to be examined and the best way of doing that is in co-operation with all the political parties.Expenditure limits will need to be reviewed for a number of reasons, including the consequences of the Kelly case, inflation since limits were set, a review of the definition of "election expenses" and the need for realistic limits in order that candidates or their agents do not need accountants to track every minor expenditure item to ensure the limits are not exceeded. Many believe the emphasis should be on transparency, not just nit-picking. I am not surprised by this. I heard Senator Kitt state he was one of the 56 who had exceeded the limit.If there was a general election tomorrow or next month, I would probably exceed my limit before publishing one leaflet because my assessment would take into account rent, light and heating costs, probably not just in respect of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but also in respect of the other Department at which I am Minister of State. I would probably have to pay Dublin 4 rent in Mespil Road also. It would not matter how often I would see the place. It is nonsensical. What chance would anybody have in such circumstances? The rules need to be changed according to the principles of common sense.When the legislation was introduced, I was concerned that we would need to reflect on third party expenditure, for which there was no limit. I am thankful that this has not yet become a serious issue. People spend money advertising themselves, their parties and policies but it sometimes happens in other countries that people on the other side engage in negative campaigning. It seems crazy that we are strictly measured in terms of what we spend promoting ourselves, yet other fronts or organisations can spend whatever they like trying to destroy us. I sincerely hope that, whatever about people promoting themselves to the best of their ability, considerable sums are never spent on negative campaigning. That would be a very sad day.This issue is very topical and presents an opportunity for us to air our views and examine the complexities and the practical difficulties experienced by candidates of political parties in attempting, as best they can, to comply conscientiously with the requirements of the legislation. The Minister who is unwell and out of commission for a few days has written to the chairman of the commission seeking its views on the working of the Electoral Act 1997 which I look forward to hearing fairly soon. I would like to see a simple, concise regime that is easy to implement for all concerned.I was a candidate in the last local elections which were run according to a system that has much to recommend it. One could spend what one liked provided one declared it. Candidates are probably the best policemen of the system because, if I saw somebody else declaring that he or she had spent €3,000 or €5,000, although I knew in my heart and soul that he or she had thrice the amount of literature I had, I could query it. I do not think anybody had any complaint. It is not necessary to have 58 pages of guidelines, detailed receipts and accounts for €20, etc. While we certainly need to have controls on the amount of money spent, more importantly, we need to see where it came from. One does not need total bureaucracy. Now that the issue is topical, I urge all Senators and parties to try to make sensible inputs into the review which is to take place in the Department.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I welcome the Minister of State and will begin by addressing an issue which ties in very closely with what he said in winding up. I listened carefully to what he had to say about there being no consensus on the previous occasion and that he hoped people would get their act together in this regard. I have difficulty with many of the points he made. I have considerable difficulty with the legislation and, although I will support the motion, I am not completely happy with it as it does not address the issue sufficiently.There is an easy way to deal with the issue of electoral expenses. Would the Minister of State be prepared to set up a joint committee which would require a qualified majority to come to conclusions? It would involve people, not just the Government, sitting down to ascertain needs, set limits and make rules. They would get rid of the 58 pages of guidelines, if required. As everyone would engage in this process together, there would be balance on the pitch.I expressed extraordinary reservations about this legislation when it was introduced. It is a little like the Intoxicating Liquor Bill dealt with earlier this evening. People were jumping up and down on a moral crusade. One almost felt unclean to be questioning some of the points made. The same is happening in respect of this motion. While I support the thinking behind it, I have a difficulty with its wording. I do not trust a Government – not necessarily the present one – to make decisions on this issue. The decision-making process should be removed from Government if the matter is to be addressed properly.I agree completely with the Minister of State's point about offices. Even if he was never a Minister of State, the legislation, with all its definitions, would allow him to be given the use of an office. This does not concern the limit on donations by the electorate. It is necessary to ask what an office is. What is the difference between an office and a space or between an office and a room? Does an office have a telephone? Is a room without a telephone an office? Should there be a photocopier, a fax machine, Internet facilities and a telephone? I suggest that any normal office should have these items. However, if this involves extra expense, who pays it? This is unclear in the legislation and needs to be looked at.I agree absolutely with the Minister of State that we should examine the issue of third party spending, in the light of the fact that there was a very vindictive campaign against me during the last election. This has always been the case to some extent and there is nothing one can do but accept it. Even on previous occasions, I had difficulties with pro-life groups, subject to no controls, campaigning actively against me and spending huge amounts of money.The public loves to read in the newspapers the list of 56 who were over the electoral spending limit. However, it would be useful to get rid of the 58 pages of guidelines and begin by ascertaining who gave how much to whom and on what was it spent. Furthermore, I would ask how much is left over and request to see the audited accounts. This would involve asking Senator O'Toole where he got the money to run his campaign and making this information available on a list. Since I first stood for election in 1981, I have always kept an account of my spending – I am not saying I am cleaner or better than anyone else – to make available the figures concerning those who supported me. It always cost me more money than I ever liked admitting to but I always included this. Given that Senators on the university panels have 100,000 constituents worldwide, I could not have run my last campaign within the limits. Luckily, the rules that apply to Senators are different from those that apply to Members of the Lower House, although some past Members of that House are now Members of the Seanad. It should be noted that each of the 56 who exceeded the spending limits were in the Lower House. If somebody knows that Senator Ross receives support from some of the upper-class or moneyed classes and that Senator O'Toole gets support from the mere trade unions, that will be of great help to that person in judging the kind of support that can be given. It is a matter of making certain information available to the public.I also agree with the point made, in proposing the motion, on when the period should begin. It is impossible to do this and I defy anyone to tell me otherwise. When asked about this during the campaign, I stated that, on the previous occasion, everybody knew there would be an election within a certain number of months. There is no way one could write the legislation at this time.I am a Kerryman and learned at a young age to drive a coach and four through most legislation. It does not take an absolute genius to work out ways around any form of words. It is about openness and transparency, although I hate using those PC words because they make one a hostage to fortune. It is important to recognise that.There is also the issue of hospitality, buying a round of drinks in the pub. If a person is canvassing and goes to the local pub, shakes hands, looks for votes and his supporters buy a round of drink for the house – it is not bought by the candidate or the campaign committee – there is no record of it, nor can there be. One cannot keep the mice out in this one. There are ways through every part of it. I would prefer an approach where there was a common objective to present a sense of clarity. For that reason I ask the Minister to consider it. An easy way would be to hand it back to the Houses and set up a joint committee to look at it, on condition that its recommendations would be decided on the basis of a qualified majority. That means it is not Government, Opposition or Independents but a considered, thoughtful process. If we cannot agree to that, which could happen, the Government would have to take over. At least it is an opportunity to approach the matter in a positive and creative way. In both Houses, whereas Members are in Government for a period and in Opposition for a period, there must be a common objective.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and warmly welcome the intention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to review the Act which governs electoral spending limits. I avail of the opportunity to congratulate the Standards in Public Office Commission on its report on the last general election under what were, even in its own words, in some cases unsatisfactory and confused circumstances. The difficulties encountered were not just on the commission's side. Having been involved in the last election, the system is cumbersome and bureaucratic. I threw my hands in the air when it was suggested – and we had to do it – that we account financially for every sheet of photocopying paper. That summed it up.As our amendment states, we need a more concise, more manageable system. Contrary to some Opposition views, we have no problem with maintaining full transparency and accountability in whatever changes are introduced. I accept that disclosures are required to ensure full and open accountability. Anyone who is involved in the running of a campaign will admit the system is flawed. The problems that have arisen are highlighted in the report from the commission.We had the result of the Kelly case on the last day of campaigning. This resulted in a fundamental change in how the Act was interpreted and in a huge burden being imposed not only on the commission but on the candidates and their agents. The commission admits it encountered difficulties with the procedure for contacting election agents. In some cases it was obvious to everyone that not all concerned were sure what an agent was or of his or her statutory duties and responsibilities. It had problems in getting clear information from the candidates and the returning officers in regard to the agents. The instruction literature, as the Minister of State said, was a 58 page document. I think that was the first volume; we received a couple of volumes during the election campaign. It is understandable that these things happened. While the instructions were not complicated, they were bulky and contained a large amount of information. It is easy to understand how somebody could unintentionally miss an important point or instruction through human error.There were also problems where, for example, there was a change in agent in the course of the election. Where this occurred, under the Act, the onus is on the returning officer to notify the commission of the change but in some cases the returning officer was not notified and, therefore, could not provide the correct information. In its report, the commission states that some returning officers were not fully aware of their responsibilities. I am sure that was unintentional but it points out the anomalies.Another point that struck me when reading the report was the restriction imposed on groups and individuals not supporting a candidate or party. In its report, the commission cites 15 cases where it considered that election expenses were incurred, totalling €50,665. These ranged across the spectrum from support for the homeless through a worthy and well-known support agency, to the students union encouraging its members to vote against Fianna Fáil. It did not do them any good but it made interesting reading. In his review I ask the Minister to look at this area and, perhaps, to firm up on it.The 1997 Act was amended in 1998, 2001 and twice in 2002, giving us the No. 2 Act. Given that it has been in operation throughout all types of elections – local, general, presidential, European and referendums – the review is timely.The commission's report was delayed for a number of reasons but mainly due to a lack of understanding. For example, it took until 11 February to obtain returns from the 463 candidates and one is still outstanding. That took at least three further contacts from the commission after the statutory deadline of 20 December. A large number of returns were of poor quality and required the commission to rework many of them. This work is still ongoing. I am convinced this is not done intentionally in the vast majority of cases. However, it is not right and something will have to be done about it.For many years there has been concern about the lack of public understanding of the political system. If the candidates or their agents have problems in understanding this system, how can we expect the electorate to understand it? It only adds to people's cynicism about politics in general. This Minister's attempt to simplify and make the system fully accountable and transparent can only be welcomed.When the legislation was introduced it was not envisaged that it would become more about the rules and regulations than the openness and transparency that we all recognise is required in this area. I agree with Senator O'Toole. I do not like clichés but, unfortunately, when it was introduced in 1997 openness and transparency were the qualities highlighted.Politics as a profession is changing rapidly. In this age of technology and mass communication, we have to be in a position to provide a modern and efficient service to our constituents. I welcome the debate on how we do this. The Minister is correct to initiate this debate now. I have no doubt when all the views are gathered from all sides, as the Minister has said he will do, any changes made as a result will improve the Act and ensure that the electorate get a clear and honest system that everybody understands.Unfortunately, some of the parties opposite still live in the past. Once the word review is mentioned, automatically the euro sign appears before their eyes. It is not all about the spending limits but the workings of the Act. Earlier another Senator mentioned the Galway races. There is an in and out door on the tent in Galway. Unfortunately for some union members they have no choice as to where their contributions go. On this side of the House we ensure people have a choice.

It would be bad if we moved to a radical extension of the spending limits for elections. The good thing about setting expenditure limits is that it puts limitations on us. A great deal of money is wasted at election time and it does not have much influence as to who is elected. Outside the inflationary increases for which one is bound to provide, there is no argument for a radical increase in expenditure. It is good to limit expenditure during the election.As part of his review, I ask the Minister of State to consider a six or eight month lead-up period. It is obscene that this amount of money can be spent six months in advance of an election and that once an election starts none of it is taken into consideration in election spending figures. We must find a way to overcome this.My key point is that all the Ministers were over the election spending limit in last week's figures because of their private offices. I have argued for a long time that the use by Ministers in their private offices of vast sums of public money for constituency and party political purposes is disgraceful. This practice has been built into the system of all parties, no matter who has been in Government, in recent years. Ministers have a substantial number of civil servants working directly to their constituency office and dealing directly with constituency issues. This is an unhealthy development which we need to stamp out quickly. Most Ministers would not have been over the limit last week were it not for the fact that they had to take into consideration the amounts of public money spent on their campaign during the three weeks of the election campaign.There is a simple way to get around this. The House of Commons closes down on the day an election is announced and nobody can get into it for three or four weeks. That practice would sort out the problem for us. Equally, Cabinet Ministers' offices and Ministers of States' offices should be out of bounds to them for the three or four weeks. None of the Ministers' officials should deal with any constituency queries during that period. It is grossly unfair that public money is used to fund Ministers' campaigns. We have seen this happen in recent years on all party fronts, my own included. The way to stop this practice is to close Departments for use by politicians of those Departments for the three or four week period of the election. We should also close down this House for that period. This would resolve the problem.There is huge pressure on politicians to raise money as we go into a general election. We all hate fund raising but ultimately we have to put our shoulders to the wheel in our constituencies to raise money for our parties. Keeping a limit on election expenditure ensures that politicians will spend less of their time raising money and more of their time dealing with constituents and the issues of the country.The Government should not increase the election spending limits when it conducts its review. It must look at the idea of having a cap or of including in the assessment of election expenditure a greater period of time before an election is called. This must be considered.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	177	This is a difficult problem and I am not sure on which side of the fence I stand. In theory, one should be able to spend a large amount of public money in defence of democracy, which makes a worthy target for public funds. We do have to pay a price for democracy. The question is how much should one be able to spend and whether that democratic funding should be supplemented by other funding.My feeling, having watched the funding of political parties over many years, is that corporate funding is not to the benefit of political parties. It does not benefit the people, the Dáil or the Seanad. I got tired of reading annual reports of corporate companies, particularly public companies, over many years. Companies like AIB, Bank of Ireland, CRH and Smurfit all said they gave money to political parties because they were great believers in democracy. They believed they did it for that reason. This was a lot of cant and everybody knows it.The reason businessmen give money to political parties is that they expect something in return. There is no doubt about this. They would not do it otherwise. People in public companies have a duty to their shareholders and would be dishonouring their shareholders if they were not getting something in return. What they are doing is giving some sort of sophisticated incentives to people to do as they wish. Anybody who believes that AIB and Bank of Ireland and CRH, with their records, were giving money to political parties of all sorts because of their devotion to democracy is naive and innocent.We must resolve the problem of people giving money to political parties. They will always do so if they think they will get something in return but will not give it if they do not. One of the problems of our present laws is that there is some sort of limit, €4,000 I think, beyond which a person must make a declaration. Why is the limit not zero? I cannot understand why all of us who stand for office should not have to disclose every cent we get, not because there is something wrong with receiving a donation, or because there is any prurient interest in it, but because it lets people know where we are coming from and admits the sort of pressures we feel.I admit that I have received little money from anybody. However, I have received some small amounts from time to time. To be honest, I feel this as a pressure when that person – I do not believe I ever received money from a company – comes to me after an election and asks if I could do this or that etc. regarding a Bill or whatever. I feel a real pressure because I remember the person gave me €50 or €100. The problem is not that they will not contribute to me again but a person feels a human and emotional obligation. People do buy favours and political returns.What we must do is decide how to regulate this area. The optimum system is that most of the money should come from public funds. We will never be able to impose total equality on this because people will fundraise and should be able to do so. People will bypass the system without breaking the law. Systems of funding political parties are virtually impossible to police. While the present controversy can be quantified in terms of Government Ministers having spent public money on their elections, other things cannot be quantified.We can quantify what Government Ministers spent and it is deplorable, although all parties have probably done the same. It is easy to say that in Opposition and it is easy to say something is wrong even when one has actually done it oneself when in power. It would be better if conclusions were reached through all-party agreement. God willing, Labour and Fine Gael will return to power one day, although Fianna Fáil will remain in power for a long time.

I thank the staff of the Standards in Public Office Commissioner for the work they have done. It was a difficult job and I can only imagine the difficulties they encountered.We need a complete overhaul of our electoral spending laws. We also need to increase spending limits. The system should be fully transparent and accountable. It needs to be clearer, more concise and more easily understood by all. Problems have arisen from the complexity of existing legislation. The Standards in Public Office Commission has pointed to the difficulties faced by those attempting to comply with the regulations.The Government is committed to full and open accountability in electoral spending. I agree with the Taoiseach that the present system is designed to make sure the Dáil is full of millionaires. It is a terrible system and totally unworkable. Wealthy Deputies can spend a fortune of their money until the campaign is announced, whereas an individual with little or no money has to fight a three-week campaign.I was a candidate in the last general election in the rural region of south Sligo and have never seen, heard, asked for or received a corporate donation. The ordinary people of the area supported my election campaign. We held four or five functions in local bars and lounges, which is where the money I used came from.Transparency of donations is more important than their size. The scale of Irish corporate donations is modest by international standards. The spending by political parties keeps people who work in printing companies in jobs. I know this from working on Seanad, Dáil and county council elections since 1977. The system of confining election spending records to within three weeks of a poll is a nonsense and completely unjustified. I want a unified system to account for all donations which would distinguish between corporate and personal donations. Do my Labour Party colleagues want the taxpayer to pick up the tab?

The cost of construction of each of those apartments was roughly €150,000. However, Sligo Corporation could only pay €100,000. He was held up for two years and nearly made bankrupt. That is the only reason this legislation had to be changed. That man can pay his contribution and his work, thankfully, has started again.

However, some of the rules, as well as the degree of petty accounting, are inflexible. As is the case with all pioneering legislation, for example, the Freedom of Information Act, we must examine it in the light of experience rather than take an inflexible attitude to it. I do not want to see radical changes. I am glad the era of large financial donations is over and do not want to see it return because it had a corrupting influence on politics and public perception and cynicism.At the same time, political parties are voluntary organisations and it is not right that all contributions should be banned. I would like to believe all Members from all sides of the House are people of integrity. Some 99.9% of the work we do is on behalf of people who have made no contribution to us whatsoever. Some of the hardest work we do is on behalf of people and organisations to which we have made a contribution like, for example, the theatre in Carrick-on-Suir. I do not accept that we work harder for those who have given us a small donation, or even bodies which have nominated us, than we do for others. It depends on the merits of each case.There was a great deal of wasteful spending. In the 1989 general election Fianna Fáil poured millions of pounds into newspaper advertisements. However, I remind Senator McCarthy that in the last general election Fianna Fáil undertook practically no national newspaper advertising. That was a good thing.

There is also a problem with small parties. As was true of The Workers' Party in the 1980s, Sinn Féin also seems to be able to run a large number of constituency offices. I noticed that there was a list of donations to unsuccesful candidates which had to be put right on behalf of Sinn Féin.It is a fallacy that elections are won on promises alone. Rather, they are won on track record, a judgment by the electorate as to who will manage the problems and challenges ahead and, only thirdly, on election commitments. I agree that ideally reform should be carried out by consensus. However, that will only be possible if parties do not use this issue as a political football and genuinely want to reach consensus.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	200	To listen to the Government, particularly the Fianna Fáil element, one would think the world only began yesterday. There were reasons the electoral Acts were changed to control expenditure, reasons we all now have to disclose donations, election expenditure is regulated and there is ethics in public office legislation. Overwhelmingly, this is the case because people connected with Fianna Fáil disgraced the profession of politics by, in one case, living a lifestyle entirely funded by his friends and, in another – in the words of the Flood tribunal – the corrupt abuse of power in ministerial office. Those are the reasons we had to deal with the question of money and politics.I wish to move away from this idea of a benevolent business community supporting democracy. I am fascinated by the different portrayals of business. I understand business quite well since I teach people who work in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, perhaps one of the most successful groups of multinationals. I know a little about how international business works. They do not do benevolence, rather they do self-interest and do so very well. In many cases, this drive toward self-interest by many companies is also good for society, provided it is regulated. Competition can often generate innovations which often generate benefits for society. To pretend that industries driven by self-interest and companies driven by shareholder benefit and value contribute to political parties because they have a sudden attack of benevolent commitment to democracy is naive in the extreme.Before it is said, I know that SIPTU contributes to my party and do not pretend it does so for the benefit of democracy. It does so because it believes a strong Labour Party in power is good for working people. However, other parties, particularly on the Government side, will pretend that when they get large donations from the building industry, it has nothing to do with the perceived interests of the industry and take grave exception when it is suggested otherwise. It is naive on the part of those members of Fianna Fáil who believe it, and profoundly disingenuous on the part of those who know better, when we are told that the decision to essentially fillet the provision for social and low cost housing in the Planning and Development Act was taken for purely benevolent reasons, not because the party was to a degree beholden to the building industry.The truth is that business contributes to political parties because it believes it can get something in return. I will not elaborate on the list of benefits that can accrue but some are worthy of mention. They include the reluctance to do anything about the hoarding of building land; the reluctance and delay in doing something about the price of housing when people were being crucified by rip-off prices in order that certain people got rich; and the decision to reduce capital gains tax at a time when the property market was booming and the last thing it needed was the stimulus of a reduction in the tax.In the view of many, these decisions are not entirely separated from the clear perception of most in the building industry that Fianna Fáil is the party which will look after it. That is not new. There has been a long-standing tradition that the industry sees Fianna Fáil as serving its best interest. It is nothing less than spectacularly naive or profoundly disingenuous to pretend that it does not see it in that light.Perhaps advertising is one of the biggest industries in the world. It does not spend all that money to no purpose. Advertising and good marketing work, as does positioning in the marketplace. Money is needed to do this. Some of it can be done during elections but much can be done beforehand, through activities such as focus group work or soft focus marketing. It all costs money and it is not all spent in the three weeks of an election campaign. That is the reason we are entitled to be suspicious when the Minister says accountability and transparency are the issues, not the level of expenditure. Again, that is disingenuous or naive.Between what was spent locally and what the party spent nationally, my expenditure during the last general election campaign totalled approximately €18,500 in a five seat constituency. It was enough. While I have no problem with honest attempts to simplify the process, I have difficulties with attempts to masquerade a process as simplification when it amounts to a filleting exercise. This happened with the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, which filleted the Government's accountability under freedom of information. It left other bodies unaltered but created a new secretive regime for the Government.While I have no problems with an intelligent look at the complications of this process, I have a profound difficulty with a decision to reverse the principle that we are spending enough on elections. Since the electoral law was changed and expenditure on by-elections severely restricted, Fianna Fáil's record in by-elections has been totally different from what it was.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Fianna Fáil was in government throughout this period but its record in winning by-elections was totally changed following the implementation of these measures. I do not know whether it is cause and effect but Fianna Fáil keeps telling us that expenditure is not the problem. Nobody else believes it is not an issue. Perhaps Fianna Fáil will tell us the reason it wants to continue spending more money if it is not influenced by donors and does not believe it makes a difference. That is nonsense.I would be happy to see the present expenditure limits adjusted in line with the consumer price index. However, there is a need to address the obscenity of the nine month period leading up to the last general election when Fianna Fáil spent an obscene sum of money on large-scale billboard hoardings and other advertising, including, in the weekend after Easter 2002, full-scale multi-page supplements to the Irish Independent. It was obscene. I do not know how much good it did the party but it believed it was worth doing. Those who fund Fianna Fáil also believed it was worth doing.I invite Fianna Fáil to address the real issues. Why does it want more money to spend on elections and why does it so resolutely insist on looking after its corporate donors? Why will it not address the fact that to achieve full transparency, political parties should be publicly funded? This would ensure no more abuse of privilege or corruption of office.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I agree with much that Senator Ryan had to say but he made some conjunctions which he was not entitled to make or which required a leap of imagination on his part. At this stage everybody on all sides of both House recognises the need for electoral Acts, the Ethics in Public Office Act, that there must be regulation and that we need to know where money comes from and how it is spent. We also need to know how Members operate and that matters are done openly and transparently. That is a given and I would be surprised if any Member said otherwise. However, we are confronted with choices about how we conduct elections. When surveyed on how they would like elections to be funded, the people frequently express their opposition to both public and private funding. We cannot have it every way. It costs money to run the electoral system and it must be found, be it from public or private sources or a combination of both. Candidates get refunds if they achieve a certain level of the vote.I agree with the views expressed about the Standards in Public Office Commission. It was helpful and tried its best to answer the questions we posed. Commission officials were always available and helpful when there were questions to be asked. However, it seems to adopt a narrow, accounting type of approach. For example, the origins of small invoices of, say, €20 or €30 must be traced. In this regard, a comparison may be drawn with the Revenue Commissioners. We must all be compliant taxpayers but the commissioners nowadays appear to be much more amenable to allowing for some degree of flexibility. The Standards in Public Office Commission should take a similar approach. It would minimise the need to ask repeated questions about minor aspects or nuances.I thank the commission for writing to me to advise that I had assigned a certain amount of my spending to the Fianna Fáil Party. I was not aware I had done so.

I have not heard from it since, which means that was perhaps the final item of correspondence.I would go much of the way towards agreeing with Senator Ross. What is required is full disclosure of everything contributed. The imposition of an upper limit is problematic, especially for the larger parties which have a multiplicity of branches. If these branches run race nights or quizzes from which come contributions to national and local golf classics, it will not take long for the limit to be reached. The difficulty of accounting at all stages means that the limit can be breached quite inadvertently. I am inclined to think that we should insist that declarations are made at all levels, but I would raise the limit considerably or abolish it altogether, provided we know from where the money comes.I am not an apologist for Fianna Fáil, but I do not see anything wrong with having a tent at the Galway races. If people wish to enter the Fianna Fáil tent, in public view, at a Galway race meeting and let everyone know they are associated with the party, that is fine. If it is out in the open and becomes public knowledge, I do not see what is the difficulty.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The Minister raised several questions in his contribution. I am glad that there is to be a review of legislation. Questions were also asked about the donation disclosure limits and I have dealt with the matter.It is reasonable as a minimum that spending limits on elections reflect inflation. They should not be left at a certain level over a number of years and the legislation should address that. Senator O'Toole and I were members of a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which dealt with the question of ethics in public office. We had to review the proposals for the blue book. There was consensus among the parties at the sub-committee. One of the issues with which we had difficulty was the matter of who is a connected person. It is illogical to think that a person who marries for a second time will know each of the business interests of the children of their spouse from a first family. I realise that there is a different standard for office holders than for the rest of us, but this can get to the point where it becomes stupid.The point raised about ministerial access to Departments and motorcars is reasonable because such things provide an edge. While Ministers have to account for the moneys involved and the decision of Supreme Court led to inadvertent breaches, this is something which must be examined. It would do no harm to impose a moratorium.The period in which election spending limits apply will have to be extended. There was huge overloading of expenditure in the lead up to the last election, quite legally, in the knowledge that after the cut-off date spending would be controlled. The date will have to be pushed well out. In Britain, for example, it is two years, though I am not sure it should be the same here. Most parties were guilty of huge expenditure before the cut-off date.Like many Members of both Houses, I should be refunded election expenses. Much of the money comes from our own pockets. When we had the multiple elections in the 1980s, the overdrafts of some went through the roof.

I question the party's self-proclaimed watchdogs on this issue. They seem to be there with a whimper, although I welcome some of the points made by Senator Dardis.I take this opportunity to compliment the Standards in Public Office Commission on the excellent job it is doing. I appreciate that many of the 56 Members who overspent did so inadvertently because of the ruling of the High Court, but the number of Ministers and Ministers of State involved demonstrates the advantage of those positions to office holders.

According to the report of the Standards in Public Office Commission, the immediate response of Fianna Fáil to the judgment was to have the Minister say that the limits would be raised and that the party was not worried about receiving finance from developers, builders or other business interests. The party may say that its measures protect democracy, but others are not so gullible as to believe it.The provisions on election spending limits should apply two years before an election is called, if that can be predicted. In the 12 to six months prior to the last general election, glossy brochures were published by Ministers outlining their so-called achievements. I wonder at whose expense that happened.

Where is that money recorded and how is it spent?In accordance with the motion before the House, I am totally opposed to raising the limits on election spending. The Government is eroding, in practically every area, the legislation that the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left coalition introduced to bring about accountability, transparency and honesty. In that context, one need only look at the recent hatchet job the Government performed on the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The same is happening in respect of election expenses.I agree with the motion before the House. No matter what attempt is made to pull the wool over the eyes of the people in respect of this issue, they will continue to be aware that they were deceived at the last election. They will not buy spin anymore.

I do not imagine that anyone has been guilty of such a lapse in the House for decades. I apologise humbly to the Cathaoirleach.Senator O'Toole seems to have had an attack of political correctness. He bewailed the political correctness of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, then came to the House and supported this motion. I have my doubts about the ethics in public office legislation because I doubt that it will make the slightest difference. Somebody who is a hook will be intelligent enough to get around it and it will only create misery and bureaucracy for Members who are honest. Nobody ever stopped a crooked person with this type of nit-picking legislation.Look at all the forms one has to sign and have notarised simply to say one got nothing. One has to pay to have the things registered also. Why can one not get this back through expenses? One has to pay to say one got nothing. I understand the argument for a level playing field. Before I became a Member of this House, I was agonised with fury that the sitting Members had the advantages of free envelopes and so forth at their disposal. Now that I am sitting in the nest, however, I am not so sure. I also believe we are entitled to a little advantage, given the hard work we do. Since we obviously accept that spending money secures one's job, why can we not write off our expenses against income tax? It is a necessary business expense to keep oneself in play.The Independents do not get any grants from political parties and must rake up the money themselves. I do not mind doing this. In 1982-83 there were three elections and I did not get a seat. The only substantial donation I received was for the election in 1987, when I was elected. It was £500 and the person who gave it wrote to me in the last couple of years saying he would never vote for me again or contribute in any way because I supported former Justice Hugh O'Flaherty when he was in difficulty. I considered the judge a decent man. I read the Hamilton report and it seemed to go a long way in exonerating him. I said as much and the fellow who had given me the £500 said he would never do so again. I will have nothing to report, therefore, in future.It would be a mistake to disadvantage people. It is most unusual for me to stick up for Ministers but occasionally I do so. There is constant talk about ministerial cars and offices. What do they want the Ministers to do? Do they want to shove the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance into a tent on Leinster Lawn, as somebody suggested, and not allow them to have a motor car?

Where is the accountability and transparency? Let us not forget that it was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who said spending at election time was not important. It is crucial. In many cases it can influence the result, about which there is no doubt.I have no difficulty with a decent review of election spending, an honest, balanced examination of the current limits and a review on that basis. However, I do not support the approach of announcing to the media last week, on the basis of the report by the Standards in Public Office Commission, that the limit would be increased to suit the Government. Let us take the Minister's comment and put it in context. In one of his declarations in the last two years he was one of the biggest beneficiaries in terms of donations. To make an announcement, following a report by the SPOC, that spending at election time was unimportant was nonsensical, to say the least. I urge the Government, particularly the Minister, to retain the limits as they stand. Nobody on this side of the House disputes that there was accounting. We want retention of the limits. It is of paramount importance, however, that expenditure leading up to the period of the election campaign should be taken into account.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The need for radiotherapy services for Waterford and for the south-east in general has been discussed for some time. The citizens of the south-east are anxious to have such services provided. The south-east is the second largest region in the country, with a population of about 450,000. Of these, some 3,000 are diagnosed with cancer each year with approximately 600 requiring radiotherapy.There are various reports about consolidating special services within the health service as part of the drive towards increased cost-effectiveness. While I subscribe to that plan, a special case can be made where cancer treatment is concerned. When someone is diagnosed with cancer, it is traumatic both for them and for their family. The medical profession agrees that a positive outlook is an important part of the treatment process.In that regard, it is a wrench for families when patients have to go to Dublin or Cork – many people from the south-east travel to the latter for treatment – and stay away from their families for perhaps a week, although the treatment lasts only ten minutes daily and is spread over five or six weeks. At a time of crisis, the support of the family is fundamental to the patients but, in this instance, there is a serious imposition on families.Some people resort to travelling daily. However, the treatment takes a toll on the physical energies of the patient, which is unsatisfactory. On compassionate grounds, there is a strong case to be made for treating patients within their areas. Given the importance and density of the population in the south-east, and that the Government strategy is focusing on Dublin and Cork – with Galway to be included – it seems that to complete that jigsaw the south-east, and Waterford in particular, would be a good location for these services.I am aware that there are capital and operational costs involved, but, equally, there is a cost involved when people from the south-east have to travel and stay away from home. The latter is borne by the health services at present. To that extent, there would be some return on investment in the service. The primary reason, however, is care of the patients at a time of serious illness, during which they can have the support of their families.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I thank Senator Walsh for sharing time. Our both speaking on this issue shows that there is some solidarity in the south-east region because this is perhaps the most important issue with which people – not only those in Waterford but the entire population of the south-east – are concerned. It is not often that people in the south-east come together to put forward a view on an issue on which they are at one. However, this is such an issue. I will not list all the reasons that we need this service. Senator Walsh has mentioned some and they are all well known. The Minister for Health and Children is aware of them because they have been brought to his attention on numerous occasions.There have been suggestions that the report of the committee chaired by Professor Hollywood is with the Minister but that he has not yet brought it to Cabinet. There have been some leaks and while we cannot testify to their veracity, they tend to be accurate. One of the suggestions is that when the south-east reaches a certain critical mass, a radiotherapy unit should be located there. A decision was made in 1998 to establish such a unit in Galway. The best estimate indicates that this unit will be in operation by 2005. Many people do not realise that there is a long lead-in period to establish units of this sort.I do not know when the report suggests that the south-east will reach critical mass – whether it be 2010 or 2012 – but there is no point in waiting until that time and then deciding that the region has reached the required critical mass to establish in a radiotherapy unit, which would take a further seven years. That is nonsense. We have to decide to work back seven years from 2010, 2012 or whenever the population will be there to sustain it, designate it as a lead-in period and move towards establishing a unit in the south-east. I have made that point to the Minister on numerous occasions and I hope that he will take it on board.I appreciate that the Minister is trying to achieve best practice for all patients and is intent on putting in place a system that will give all patients proper cancer treatment, which even he acknowledges they are not receiving at present. However, there are some matters – one of which involves access – that are out of his control. The biggest difficulty is that patients from the south-east are obliged to travel to Dublin, they are thrown around in ambulances on their journey, they have no place to stay in the city when they arrive and they are obliged to return home. Even if accommodation was provided, it might be suitable only for someone who is more settled in life who perhaps does not have any responsibilities at home and can stay away for a few weeks.Cancer can attack anybody, at any age, and, unfortunately, many young mothers are being diagnosed with the disease. They cannot stay away from home for five or six weeks, they have to go home every evening to look after their children and so on.It is vital that these services are put in place close to the people whom they are supposed to serve. That is why there is an unanswerable case in terms of providing such a unit in the south-east.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank Senators Jim Walsh and Kenneally for raising this matter and outlining what I know is heartfelt by both of them – the provision of radiotherapy services for cancer patients in the Waterford region. I take the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of radiotherapy services nationally.As the Senators are aware, an expert review group on radiotherapy services was established to examine their appropriate future development. The group comprises, as one would expect, a multidisciplinary team of experts. It has conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services.The group will address the following key issues, which have been referred to by the Senators: access to radiotherapy services; information, finance and organisational components, and the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service. I appreciate that both Senators have indicated that the evidence is available. The group will also address the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology, the requirements of the system in human resources, international norms regarding service provision, planning and staffing, and the organisational development of the services in structures and processes which must be in place, as one would expect, in a radiotherapy facility.All health boards, including the South-Eastern Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet and make submissions to the group. The provision of additional radiotherapy services will be considered in the context of its report. Senator Kenneally has asked exactly where it is. On completion, it was submitted to the Minister on 24 April 2003. On receipt, the Department immediately made arrangements to print it, a process subject to public tendering requirements which have to be followed, as they have been.Given the significance attached to it by me, the Minister and the Department and its implications for the development of radiation oncology services nationally, it is necessary to submit the report to the Government. The Minister advised the Dáil of his intentions in that regard on 7 May 2003. It is also necessary that there be consultation at interdepartmental level, including with the Department of Finance, before consideration by the Government. It is anticipated that the report will be considered by it shortly.I understand the Minister met a delegation from Waterford City Council this morning and outlined the key principles which informed the group's deliberations and the priorities for the development of radiotherapy services. He accepts that the significant under-capacity in radiotherapy services represents a major challenge for the health service.With regard to cancer services generally, there has been considerable investment in the development of oncology and haematology services and symptomatic breast disease services in the South-Eastern Health Board area. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997 and following representations, including some from the Senators, an additional cumulative sum of approximately €30 million has been allocated to the South-Eastern Health Board for the development of cancer services. This level of investment has enabled the approval of ten additional consultant posts in the health board in key areas such as medical oncology, surgery, radiology and haematology. This level of investment in the south-eastern region has delivered real benefits to cancer patients and their families. When the report is ready, I will be happy to work with the two Senators to see what additional services can be put in place.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I thank the Minister of State for taking the time this evening to come to the House. I express the fear felt locally in County Donegal, coming from Sheephaven Credit Union which is extremely worried about the new consumer credit directive and how it will affect, on a grander scale, the smaller, rural type of credit union. As Senators are well aware, credit unions have filled a gap for a certain targeted market over the past 15 to 20 years. They have probably eradicated many of the loan sharks and the dodgy lending in a certain socio-economic group.Sheephaven Credit Union is totally voluntary. There are about 40 voluntary and three paid workers. It is not on the same scale as some of the credit unions in the large cities. Its members believe, as a result of being included in the directive, that they will be burdened and put under pressure as a lending institution. The totally voluntary sector has ploughed profits back through rebates and dividends.I highlight the great work that credit unions do but need hardly say this, for the Minister of State is aware of it. It is very important that the issue is not treated as black and white for all credit unions. There is definitely a case for them to be examined on merit rather than have a blanket situation regarding the Consumer Credit Act 1995. I look forward to the Minister of State's response and call for credit unions not to be included in the directive dealing with the Consumer Credit Act 1995.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I thank the Senator for raising this matter and agree with his remarks about the good work of the credit union movement currently and in recent years. I think I have some good news for him. I have noted the points he has raised and will relay them to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with whom I will discuss the matter in the next few hours. I would also like to apologise on behalf of the Minister who would like to take this debate but, unfortunately, is not able to do so.Before outlining the Minister's position, I draw together the numerous background strands to the issue which the Senator has raised. Section 3(2) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 excludes credit unions from its scope. This means, inter alia, that they are not bound by those provisions which relate to advertising or credit arrangements which derive mainly from the 1987 consumer credit directive.Earlier this year the European Commission issued a reasoned opinion which found that Ireland, by excluding credit unions from the scope of the 1995 Act, had failed to transpose the directive correctly. While it may be possible to argue against some of the Commission's conclusions, it is unlikely that a full and successful defence of the transposition could be mounted. In any case, the Commission made a proposal for a new directive on consumer credit in 2002 which reflects its policy for further harmonisation of EU consumer protection regulations in financial services. The proposal does not allow scope for any similar exemption for credit unions, although some member states, including Ireland, will seek to have it take account of their needs and circumstances in the course of the negotiations which have yet to take place.At this stage it is not possible to predict what will be contained in the directive or when it will be adopted but it is reasonable to assume that some revision of the relevant Acts will have to take place. Although the Consumer Credit Act does not apply to credit unions, the fact that their activities and rules have to be in accordance with the Credit Union Act 1997 provides a substantial measure of consumer protection for their customers.As the Senator will be aware, policy responsibility in respect of both credit unions and consumer credit matters recently passed to the Minister for Finance with the coming into force of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003. The post of Consumer Director is specifically provided for within the structure of the single regulatory authority established under the Act. The director exercises important consumer protection powers under the Consumer Credit Act and other Acts. In recognition of the unique role played by credit unions in society, a separate statutory post of Registrar of Credit Unions is also provided for in the Act.This is the background against which measures to implement the 1987 EU directive on credit unions must be considered. Obviously, repeal of the exemption provision to bring them within the full scope of the Consumer Credit Act is one option. However, the Minister's preference is for an approach which would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions while addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements which arise from the directive. He has accordingly asked his Department to explore the possibility of using or expanding some of the existing arrangements under the Credit Union Act to accommodate the requirements of the directive. The development and implementation of suitable measures based on this approach will require the co-operation and assistance of the credit union movement and the regulatory authority, as well as acceptance by the European Commission.I will be happy to keep the Senator informed of developments if he contacts the Minister for Finance's office.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Brierfield national school is one of 289 projects at the early stage of architectural planning in the Department of Education and Science. I understand it is in band 3. The school has no cloakroom, hot water or toilets. That is a serious situation when one has a three teacher school with 63 pupils. There are several young families in the area and every indication numbers in the school will probably increase.The board of management of the school is anxious that the Minister looks at a pilot initiative to provide funds for indoor toilets, which are obviously badly needed. The school also seeks enlargement of one classroom as the building is 110 years old which means the rooms are, therefore, much smaller than the minimum recommended size, with children crammed together in stuffy rooms. This is not an environment conducive to learning, nor is it satisfactory from a safety point of view, as children are more prone to bump into things in an overcrowded room. A resource teacher room and a storage room are also needed. There are only three rooms and three teachers in the school and rooms are needed for learning support, school administration and so on. This work is all done in the corridor which is draughty, cluttered with coats and bags and offers no privacy.Brierfield national school is not on the list of large-scale projects. The board of management is concerned that its needs are not progressing under the programme. Children need better facilities now, not in ten years time. The school is not looking for luxuries but for basic facilities which other schools have had for years. The board of management is very capable and the parents' committee interested in the welfare of the children. I hope the response from the Department will state the school will be included in the pilot initiative and funds will be provided. The board of management would spend the funds wisely. The building work is to be done in two phases. If this was approved, a modern school and a healthier, more spacious environment would be provided for the deserving children of Brierfield national school.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-18 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the proposed major building project at Brierfield national school, Ballinasloe, County Galway. The current position is that the large-scale building project for the school is listed in section 7 of the 2003 schools building programme which the Minister for Education and Science published on the Department's website, www.education.ie. The project is at an early stage of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 3 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. However, primary school projects listed in sections 6 and 7 are not being authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The timing of when such projects can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, as well as the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.The position on the pilot initiative referred to by the Senator is that 20 primary schools were invited to participate in the pilot phase of the initiative. The Department chose the 20 schools following detailed assessment and the initiative will be reviewed at the end of 2003 with a view to its expansion, subject to available funding, to other small primary schools in 2004.Given the Senator's special interest in Brierfield national school and developing educational facilities, I invite him to work with the office of the Minister in the latter part of this year and into 2004 to see what can be done. In the intervening time individual schools should use their devolved grants to deal with any urgent health and safety works. I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to outline the current position.The Seanad adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 June 2003.
