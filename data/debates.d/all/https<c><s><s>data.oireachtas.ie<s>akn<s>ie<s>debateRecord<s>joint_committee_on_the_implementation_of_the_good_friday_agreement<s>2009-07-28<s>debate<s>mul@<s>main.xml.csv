#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Is ócáid speisialta dúinn uilig bheith ag an gcruinniú tábhachtach stairiúil seo.  Is é seo an chéad uair riamh a tháinig Aire isteach chun tuarascáil a thabhairt dúinn faoi eachtraí an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas.  Gabhamid buíochas leis an Aire, an Teachta Martin, agus a hoifigigh as ucht a láithreacht anseo inniu.  It is a great pleasure for me to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to report on the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council that took place on 6 July.  Again, I welcome our colleagues from the Northern Ireland Assembly and our MEPs; it is always a pleasure to have them with us.  Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement provided for a North-South Ministerial Council to bring together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and within the Irish Government to develop consultation, co-operation and action on the island of Ireland.  This applies to co-operation on an all-island and cross-Border basis on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the administrations North and South.  The eighth plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council took place at Farmleigh House in Dublin on 6 July.  The meeting was chaired by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Northern Ireland Executive delegation was led by the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MP, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MP.  It is a pleasure to have the Minister, Deputy Martin, before the committee.  I also warmly welcome his colleagues from the Department, Mr. Fergal Mythen, deputy director, Mr. Paul Gleeson, first secretary, North-South division, and Mr. Ralph Victory, first secretary, justice and security division.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Tá áthas orm bheith anseo chun labhairt leis an gcoiste mar gheall ar an gcruinniú den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas a tharla le déanaí.  Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an cuireadh.  It is a great privilege to be here.  I am delighted to join the committee and colleagues from North and South at this meeting.  This is my first appearance before the committee as Minister for Foreign Affairs and I take the opportunity to commend the committee for the breadth of work which it has undertaken in the past two years.The past year in Northern Ireland has witnessed further steps towards fully implementing the Good Friday Agreement.  There has been progress in a number of areas, including on the North-South front.  I am pleased to see the Executive and Assembly making progress towards the devolution of policing and justice powers.  I have had the opportunity in the past year to meet political leaders from all the main parties in Northern Ireland and I am confident they can rise to meet the challenges that remain to help Northern Ireland to become a fully normalised society and to reap the full benefits of peace and stability.I wish to focus my remarks today on the North-South agenda and on the work of the North-South Ministerial Council, including the most recent plenary hosted by the Taoiseach in Farmleigh on 6 July last.  I note the degree to which North-South contact has become part of routine ministerial business in both jurisdictions.  This was the fourth North-South Ministerial Council plenary meeting since restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions in May 2007.  In addition, there have been some 42 ministerial meetings in the same period.  Each of these sectoral meetings involves a Minister from each tradition in the North, as well as their Southern counterparts.  There is a busy agenda of work under way and a growing relationship between Ministers of all backgrounds that should bode well for improved co-operation in the months and years to come.  This meeting affords me an opportunity to emphasise once again the highest priority which the Government attaches to the North-South Ministerial Council and to the full and effective functioning of the North-South bodies created by the Good Friday Agreement.  These are unique constitutional and political entities, delivering real benefit to people North and South.  Such bodies as Tourism Ireland and InterTrade Ireland have a key role to play in economic recovery on the island and we look forward to working closely with the Executive to ensure this potential is fulfilled.The recent plenary in Farmleigh included constructive discussion between Ministers North and South on a range of pressing issues, including a thorough and wide-ranging examination of the current economic challenges we face.  My colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was able to brief Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive on the proposed establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and its implications for the property sector in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach also briefed the Council on the Government's plans to restore competitiveness to the economy and to return to a path of sustainable public finances.  We discussed some of the budgetary challenges likely to be faced by the Executive in the coming years and examined where there might be potential to expand our co-operation in areas of mutual interest.  I am of the firm conviction that both Administrations stand to gain by promoting the island as a centre of excellence for innovation and cutting-edge research.We also considered progress in North-South co-operation since our last plenary meeting in January.  This included the close co-operation between relevant authorities North and South following the recent swine flu outbreaks and the cross-Border agreement on the removal of waste illegally dumped in Northern Ireland.  In addition, there has been increased co-operation in such areas as child protection and suicide prevention, areas in which we each stand to gain from harmonising our guidelines and strategies for dealing with such issues as Internet safety.  We also held a wide-ranging discussion on Project Kelvin, which will provide a boost to Monaghan and the north west.  It is difficult to overstate the importance of high quality broadband in terms of attracting investment to the region and European support has been important in this case.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Of equal if not greater importance for the north west will be the upgraded A5 road to Derry and Letterkenny and this also featured on the plenary agenda.  The Ministerial Council agreed a first Government contribution of €9 million towards the A5 and A8 projects before the end of this year.  The preferred route for the upgraded A5 was announced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Conor Murphy, last week.We are committed, even in these straitened times, to delivering on our roads investment package and building the all-island infrastructure which will allow the economy to return to a path of sustainable and enduring growth.  I know Northern Ministers appreciated the assurances we were able to offer in this respect.We also considered progress regarding the St. Andrews Agreement review of North-South bodies and areas of co-operation, the North-South consultative forum and the North-South parliamentary forum.  On the review agreed at St. Andrews, we instructed the review group to accelerate its work on all the elements of the review and to provide a final report to the next plenary meeting before the end of 2009.The establishment of the North-South consultative forum is awaiting the conclusion of the Northern Ireland Executive's review of the civic forum.  We have already submitted our ideas to the Executive on the role a North-South consultative forum might play in advising on social, economic and cultural issues with a cross-border dimension.The North-South parliamentary forum is primarily a matter for the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Some progress has been made in recent months between the Ceann Comhairle and his Northern counterpart, Mr. Willie Hay, MLA.  Working groups have been established in the Oireachtas and Assembly and a joint meeting has been scheduled for October.  I know everyone here will join me in seeing huge advantages to parliamentarians North and South coming together to consider the ever increasing range of issues of mutual concern.North-South co-operation is hugely important to the future development of the island of Ireland.  As I have outlined, important work is being taken forward jointly by Ministers from both jurisdictions across a range of sectors.  Ministers are now in frequent contact to explore options, agree positions and co-ordinate plans on an all-island basis.  Much of this is not breaking news material and will not grab the headlines.  However, it is the kind of detailed, strategic co-operation which will, in the long run, make a significant difference to all those we represent, North and South.As we work to promote co-operation, trust and understanding on a North-South basis, I acknowledge the support and advice we receive from the Special EU Programmes Body, namely, the North-South body delivering the European Union's PEACE and INTERREG programmes.The role of the European Union in the successful pursuit of peace and stability on the island rarely receives the credit it deserves.  As we struggled to bring an end to the conflict, it was the European Union which, between 1995 and 2006, contributed more than €1 billion to promote cross-Border contacts and economic development, foster reconciliation and build relationships between those of different traditions and backgrounds.  Now, as the Northern Ireland Executive and other institutions get on with the business of government, the European Union is contributing an additional €225 million towards peace and reconciliation until 2013, demonstrating once again its deep-rooted commitment to peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.In the context of the forthcoming debate on the Lisbon treaty, these are points that are well worth considering and very often do not get a profile.  Sometimes when one hears the language used when speaking about the Lisbon treaty and the European Union, one would not think it had made such an outstanding commitment to peace on the island of Ireland.  Colleagues should reflect on and acknowledge the important contribution the Union has made, and continues to make, to conflict resolution and peace building in Ireland.I would like to conclude with a few remarks on an issue which must be tackled head on in the months and years to come, namely, the continuing scourge of sectarianism and division and the need to promote reconciliation on a cross-community and a North-South basis.  The parades-related violence two weeks ago in north Belfast is a reminder to us that there is still significant work to be undertaken at community level to overcome fear and mistrust and to ensure that the benefits of peace reach into every neighbourhood.  I reiterate, however, that there is no excuse for violent behaviour of this type.  With everybody else, I was also appalled by the senseless murder of Kevin McDaid earlier this year in Coleraine.  Sectarianism cannot be permitted to continue to blight the considerable progress made to date in Northern Ireland.We have always known that peace in the long-term depends on reconciliation on a societal scale and at the level of local communities and individuals.  The efforts made to achieve this must include all parts of this island.  In that regard, my Department's reconciliation and anti-sectarianism funds are helping communities across the island of Ireland to build sustainable relationships based on mutual understanding and respect.  These funds are making a real contribution to improving North-South relations.For our part, the Government stands ready to assist organisations and individuals in confronting sectarianism within their community and in laying the foundations for a genuinely shared future for all the people of this island.  I am very grateful for the committee's attention and will be happy to answer any questions on the North-South agenda, and indeed on other Northern Ireland-related issues of concern and interest to members of the committee.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I thank the Minister for his detailed report.  This is the first time a Minister has reported to the committee on North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  It is an innovative step and will help us all in our work.

People from Donegal and Cork can say nice things to each other for the next few days but as the weekend approaches we might become a little more hostile and might need a good referee.

While some people might have tried to move things closer to the River Bann than we would have wanted they have been moved back to Derry.  I know we are not supposed to mention the war but if we are not allowed to raise the issues that are important to us we will go nowhere.  We all have to be big enough to say that the east-west divide on the island must end.  The recent action on the N2-A5 was a great step in the right direction.  I thank the Minister for the projects he has outlined and the many that are to come.I agree that none of these projects get big headlines yet they should.  The Foyle ferry is a major project for access for us.  The Minister managed to work with me to have its designation changed from international to domestic in order that we could get rid of the international security measures.  These basic matters might not make the headlines but they should because one of the biggest spurs to peace and co-operation and economic regeneration occurs when people from each part of the island who do not usually go to the other can interact and while they come here as tourists we go there to shop.  It is important to realise the importance of the change in the ferry's status.I will not leave the other bone of contention alone.  I want to flag to the officials the involvement of the Crown estate in seeking money from the car ferry and its territorial claim.  These issues need to be addressed.  The peace process has continued long enough for us to start addressing those thorny issues.A sex offender who had not fulfilled his terms of registration in the North was recovered in Wicklow or Wexford today.

#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda must be acknowledged as another aspect of the important work that affects families in my area.  People there are worried about the sex offenders' registers and the mutual recognition of offences.  They want to be sure that those who commit the offences are not only found but dealt with.A total of 200 viable devices were found in the past two years in the North, one of which was on the bridge in Derry which could have impeded my ability to get to Dublin.  Another was in Central Station which could have impeded my journey to Dublin had I taken the train.I will give one example to explain why I like to interact with the Minister and his officials when they meet their counterparts in the North.  The Enterprise train from Belfast to Dublin was co-financed by EU funding.  It is operated jointly by Translink in the North and Iarnród Éireann in the Republic.  If I log onto Translink's website to book my ticket, I cannot book it from Dublin.  In terms of paying for it in the North, it previously cost £36 sterling for a monthly return ticket but it has gone up to £40 sterling.  If one buys the same ticket in Dublin to go North it is €55, which is the wrong amount if one goes by today's rate.  If I go on the train and decide to buy a cup of coffee, it costs £1.60 sterling or €2.40.  There should be no exploitation of our customers, depending on where they decide to get on the train, if it is a co-financed, co-sponsored train service.  I raised this issue with Translink but was told that it is not a bureau de change and therefore it is nothing to do with it.  It sets its rate and that is it.I value this meeting and the interaction.  I would like to think we could find some mechanism whereby those of us who are dealing with North-South issues on a daily basis because it is part of our lives based on our geographic location can not only hear about what has happened but have an input into the agenda and the issues that are of real concern, while acknowledging that serious work is ongoing in health, education and across the different spectrums and that there is greater co-operation taking place between all of our elected representatives than ever was the case previously.  We have to find that forum.I believe in the Assembly where the North-South Ministerial Council meetings are debated.  We have to put what is going on there centre stage and it must reflect a reality.  We do not want to go back to the old saying of the armchair republican who wanted to fight the battle.  These issues should be headline news.  We should be flagging them as significant issues.  It is the media's problem if they do not want to drive them beyond this.  We have a serious problem in the media in that they do not recognise the significant changes that have been made for the people in my area and those I represent.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I thank the Minister for attending with his staff and giving us a presentation.  I acknowledge the major benefits of the North-South Ministerial Council for everybody in Ireland.  The fact that there have been 42 sectoral meetings of Ministers, North and South, in just over two years is not well recognised.  There may be a problem about the way all of that is reported but the fact that it has happened is hugely significant and the fact that Unionist Ministers attend their share of those sectoral meetings is a major step forward also.I was in attendance at the meeting last week when the two Ministers, North and South, Conor Murphy and Deputy Dempsey, announced the preferred route of the new dual carriageway.  I nearly said motorway but I believe we will have a dual carriageway.  We have now moved into the phase of consultation, which is happening as we speak in Omagh, Strabane, Derry and Ballygawley.  All of that is a huge advance, as is the €9 million that has been allocated to it.The Minister commented on the money the European Union has given in terms of the peace initiatives.  All of that is well recognised and acknowledged, particularly in the Border counties but also throughout the Six Counties.  There is no lessening of the recognition of the European Union and the Lisbon treaty debate is not about that but about the type of Europe we want in the future.I was particularly struck by what the Minister referred to as the scourge of sectarianism.  That is the right term.  It is a deep-routed issue in the Six Counties and there is no other way of dealing with it but by naming it in such stark terms.  The problem must be tacked locally as well as at a national, Assembly and parliamentary level.  We cannot avoid the deep-rooted issue of sectarianism, which is a scourge on society in the North.  All sectors of society will have to play their part in terms of dialogue and communication to tackle it, from Church groups to community groups to political leaders across the face of society.  I had intended asking other questions about the work of the St. Andrews Agreement review group but my colleague wants to deal with this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I thank the Minister for his comments.  I wish to make two or three brief points.  I thank the committee for their efforts in respect of the North-South co-operation so far, but there is a level of frustration among people around some aspects.  People would like more movement to be taking place.  We would like to see the establishment of a North-South parliamentary forum.  We would like to know what suggestions the committee has as to what any of us, North or South, can do to move forward its establishment.  It would be a robust organisation, would do considerable good work and would be beneficial not only in ways we have foreseen but perhaps in ways we have not foreseen.The Minister mentioned Project Kelvin and the benefit it would bring to Monaghan and the north west.  Would it benefit Fermanagh, which at the northern end of the country is a little outside the loop, or west Cavan on this side of the Border?  Such benefit would be important for those areas, which are perhaps even more improvised than most.Having a health service background, the health issue is a most significant one for me.  At what stage does the Minister envisage free movement in the context of a health service, where a patient in Donegal could receive health care in the North or a patient in Fermanagh could receive health care in Sligo?  There is considerable co-operation in terms of public health care.  Members of the public in general will not perceive any great benefit from such co-operation until such time as there is a method of accessing health care on either side of the Border, for example, a patient from one side of the Border being able to access a medical card on the other side.  I am sure that might be fixable in some way.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his colleagues.  I also welcome his recognition of the role this committee plays.  There are many issues we could discuss.  As a farmer and having been involved at one time in a farming organisation, one issue dear is my heart is the need to put in place an all-Ireland animal health regime.  The Border does not stop the spread of TB or of foot and mouth disease.  There is a great need to progress the putting in place of such a regime.I also want to comment on the Lisbon treaty and agree with the Minister on the need to ensure people are better informed that what the European Union has done for the peace process has been significant and extremely useful in terms of the Border issue.  Some people want to claim responsibility for providing a fund without admitting its source.That brings me on to an issue that has been highlighted by Senator Keaveney and others regarding the A5.  We must not forget that the A5 runs into the M2.  As Mr. Doherty, MP, said, a discussion is taking place on the proposed route of the A5 from Derry to Aughnacloy.  I intend to be in Ballygawley on Thursday to examine this situation.  We need to move forward urgently to get clarification on the route from Aughnacloy to at least Castleshane in County Monaghan, as the road from Aughnacloy to Emyvale to Monaghan town is extremely dangerous and many lives have been lost on it.  If the route of the new dual carriageway from Derry to Aughnacloy will be to the east of Aughnacloy on the Caledon side, that indicates it is expected that the new route will be from there to west of Middletown to Castleshane.  That must be done because when the Taoiseach announced the dual carriageway, he said it would go from Derry to Dublin.  We do not expect miracles but that link must be clarified as soon as possible.  I appreciate also the ongoing work on the Ulster Canal and on other cross-Border issues which have been mentioned.There is nothing more important than employment.  Throughout the Border area and the North, we must work on the issue of employment and its importance.  Sectarianism was mentioned.  The problem of sectarianism often arises when people do not have work.  Their idle hands get involved in other issues.  We have a problem in the Border area and north of the Border in that during the years, little work was done there by the IDA, etc., because of the Border issue.  That is extremely important and I link health, which has been mentioned, to that.  Monaghan General Hospital has been closed but, thankfully, a new hospital is being built in Enniskillen.  There is room for co-operation on those issues.A North-South parliamentary forum is extremely important.  It would provide an opportunity for parliamentarians to work together, as Ministers do.  In my days in a farm organisation, I had open access to my colleagues in Northern Ireland whom I met regularly.  In 1991 when I entered the political field, I could not believe the difficulties in terms of being seen to talk to my counterparts in counties Fermanagh and Armagh.  It took a long time to get around that but we have moved forward.  That forum was part of the St. Andrews Agreement and it should be moved forward as quickly as possible.  The devolution of policing and justice was also part of the St. Andrews Agreement and it is important it is moved forward and that there are clear indications on who will lead this.I refer to sex offenders.  There was one in Monaghan town not so long ago.  It is an area in which there are no borders.  I welcome any co-operation in that area, as I do in the area of security.There is a unique situation in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh.  The road from Clones to Cavan crosses over the Border five times.  Part of that road has been restructured and, unfortunately, young people are using it as a rallying area and are causing serious problems for the people in that area.  Will the Minister note this and to try to find some way to resolve it?  The Garda cannot monitor the Northern section of the road and the PSNI have great difficulty entering that section because of the threat of bombs, etc., on the road.That road is the most important one for the people of Monaghan now that the hospital in Monaghan has closed because it is used by ambulances.  When the young, or not so young, boys use their cars, motorcycles and other vehicles on it, it is closed off.  The threat of bombs does the same.  That issue must be dealt with as a matter of urgency and at ministerial level.

In particular, I welcome his remarks on the EU contribution to peace on the island, which is often overlooked in the context of the Lisbon treaty debate.  It is useful to be reminded of this.  I also welcome his remarks regarding the work being done in tackling the scourge of sectarianism, which requires a great deal of effort at community level, as the Minister said, but also at the level of primary education.  I wonder whether consideration is being given on both sides of the Border to taking the schooling system back from under the control of the different religious denominations, which is essential in terms of seeking to put an end to sectarianism.  I wanted ask, too, about the steps being taken in light of the reports we saw, regarding the harassment of Romanian people in Northern Ireland in those areas where they were allegedly being driven from their homes by a very different, but related scourge, namely, racism.Colleagues have raised the issue of co-operation on the health services.  I was out earlier with women mostly from Sligo and Donegal, protesting about the removal of breast cancer services from Sligo.  It is clear that services that might be available nearer home, across the Border, should be open to women and, indeed, men, in the Sligo and Donegal area.  I wonder, echoing what others have said, whether steps are being taken to open up services in Derry in particular, to the people in Donegal.The Minister said he was pleased to see that the Executive in the Assembly was making progress towards devolution of policing and justice powers.  I believe the First Minister and Deputy First Minister announced last November their agreement on a process leading to devolution of powers to the Executive and there have been various reports since, including the naming of a predecessor of mine from Trinity College as a potential Attorney General in Northern Ireland.  Do we have  any concrete dates or developments leading to a timeframe being developed for real devolution of these powers?

It would be remiss of us not to welcome the appointment of Ms Hillary Clinton as Special Envoy to Northern Ireland.  I congratulate Mr. Pat the Cope Gallagher, who has joined us on becoming an MEP.  As Leader of Seanad Éireann if there is something we can do to highlight the good work that is going on at Council of Ministers level, then we are more than willing to do it.  We are at an advanced stage in bringing the proposals for Seanad reform to a conclusion and we should like to offer a forum to our ministerial colleagues, as the Northern Ireland Assembly has done, in facilitating meetings, to give the Upper House the centre stage role it deserves in this regard, through the media.

I take the opportunity, particularly with regard to the European Union's enormous contribution to peace and progress to date to say there should not be even a hint that this is dependent on how we might vote in the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty in October.The key question I have for the Minister relates to the St. Andrews Agreement review group, which gave an updated report on work to date.  The Council noted that the first part of the review had been completed; therefore, when will the public have sight of it?  The review gave the implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland a clean bill of health in terms of efficiencies and value for money, which is particularly welcome, given the current climate, with people continually attacking the public sector.  The key issue is when the first part of the review will be published.  Furthermore, can the Minister offer an assurance that the completion date for the remainder of the review, which is the end of this year, will be adhered to?I would like to see greater progress in regard to the consultative forum and the parliamentary forum, as other speakers have mentioned.  The recession reinforces the logic of an all-island economy and all-island co-operation on economic planning as opposed to the current situation of two competing economies.  Where is the urgency in terms of agreeing a joint work programme in regard to economic planning and the establishment of an all-island economy?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I welcome the Minister and the many positive developments he has outlined.  My question arises from the Minister's reference to the continuing scourge of sectarianism and division.  Has any research been undertaken into the reasons for the escalation of violence in the last six to nine months?  We have all heard about the construction of new peace walls in the last year.  There seems to be a disconnect between the structures in place and what is happening in the general community.  Is this being examined?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I will respond to the questions in the order in which they were put to me.  I am more than willing to address the committee on every occasion on which there is a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Furthermore, if members wish me to attend a meeting to discuss any other issue with them, I will be pleased to do so.  In the context of the Oireachtas debate on the Lisbon treaty and as part of the accountability changes we are willing to make, I have made the proposal that all Ministers should address the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs prior to and in the aftermath of their attendance at European Council meetings.  In the context of the North-South Ministerial Council, reporting to members of this committee after meetings and getting feedback from them makes sense.  I am more than enthusiastic in that regard.  Moreover, other Ministers should appear before the committee to account for matters under their jurisdiction and to obtain the views of members.I appreciate Senator Keaveney's thanks for and appreciation of the work of my officials on various matters.  In regard to Project Kelvin, I note the Senator's concerns regarding the location of the telehouse and so on.  It is a €30 million project, some €7.5 million of which will come from the State and some €22 million from the European Union.  This contribution is not sufficiently acknowledged.  In all the discussions of Project Kelvin, there is much discussion of the location of the telehouse, but I almost never hear mention of the European Union funding.  The key issue is the impact of broadband for the entire north west.  Others have asked about what can be done beyond that.  There is clearly potential for further development but not within the contract of Project Kelvin itself.  However, it is to be hoped that more can flow from this.I do not agree that the broader issue of the degree of recognition of the positive impact of European Union support can be disconnected entirely from the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  Mr. Doherty, MP, and I will have to agree to differ.  It is too simplistic a statement.  The Lisbon treaty debate tends to be around the specifics of the treaty and away from the sentiment and orientation of the entity called the European Union.  My point is that the mindset of the European Union, as far as I can see, in terms of its application to Ireland and its manifestation in Ireland, has not been about military aggrandisement, super-military structures or defence pacts.  Rather, it has been about peacekeeping, peace building and conflict resolution.  Increasingly, member states look to the island of Ireland as a model for conflict resolution and building peace in societies and communities with historical tensions, disagreements and conflicts.  I will leave this point here.  The European Union has not received the credit it deserves for its contribution to the North.  Not many in the South know that €1 billion has been spent in a ten-year period in the North.  We could be collectively responsible for not highlighting it, given the dissemination of ideas and projects.Senator Keaveney consistently raises the matter of the Lough Foyle ferry service.  She has harassed me about it a couple of times in the corridors of Leinster House.  Progress has been made regarding the service.  In terms of the increased security arrangements at Magilligan and the significant budgetary impediment for local councils in seeking to ensure the service's sustainability, the Department for Transport in London, our Department of Transport and my officials worked well together.  Other colleagues pressed the issue alongside the Senator.  We have received assurances from Whitehall that Magilligan will no longer be considered a port facility under the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code and that the additional security measures applied to the ferry service will not be required.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	24	This decision has duly lessened the burden on local councils seeking to ensure the long-term viability of the ferry service.  We are told that a successful retendering process has occurred.Concerning any discussions on a uniform approach to aquaculture in Lough Foyle, the Crown Estate, in view of its functions within the British system, will be the interlocutor for deliberations with the Loughs Agency and, where necessary, our Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.We have been in touch with Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways to consider all aspects of the Enterprise rail service to improve reliability wherever possible.  We bring members' comments in terms of currency calculations on fares and so on to the two operating companies concerned and the transport Ministers, Deputy Dempsey and his counterpart, to determine whether we can get passengers a fairer deal.Mr. Doherty, MP, raised the issue of the number of sectoral meetings.  I have addressed the matter of the EU funding the peace initiative, which Mr. Doherty, MP, stated is well recognised.  The Lisbon treaty debate is not about that issue and I would have a broader argument, but there is connectivity and the two matters cannot be separated.I take the point on the scourge of sectarianism, on which a number of people have focused.  The greatest issue facing us is how to translate political agreement, notwithstanding significant constraints on that progress, into dividends on the ground in terms of community relations.  Through our reconciliation and anti-sectarianism funds, we allocate grants to various community groups, schools and bodies that develop cross-community and cross-Border projects with agendas of reconciliation and greater community understanding.  I have been telling the British Government and everyone who will listen that we need to step up our work on this front and to take a more comprehensive approach.As Deputy Crawford mentioned, the unemployment situation and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas are underlying factors.  The social indices of some Northern communities are striking compared with other Northern and Southern communities' indices.  For many decades, the Republic's experience has been similar, given our RAPID and drug task force areas.  Our approach was a comprehensive integrated programme from different Departments and agencies.  We attacked issues using a multidisciplinary and multi-agency approach.  This is the next great agenda in the North if we are to underpin and give real meat to the political agreement.  This will not be an easy challenge, but we must focus on it.  The Executive has a clear role in this regard, as have the two Governments in supporting such an endeavour.  I am making it a priority in my role as the Minister for Foreign Affairs to drive that agenda and I will take on board all of the comments made by Mr. Doherty, MP, and others in response to my opening remarks.I take the point made by Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, MP, MLA, on frustration about some aspects of our work.  The parliamentary forum is an integral part of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements and we must reiterate that point.  It can play a very important role in mutual understanding and co-operation to the common good of everyone on the island.As a young Deputy, I learned much through ad hoc gatherings with politicians in the North.  As I would like to think I am still a young Deputy, I will say when I was a younger Deputy.  I must be careful what I say.  I recall being in Ballycastle with Unionists and loyalists and for the first time getting a great insight into their perspectives and mindsets on the issues while at the same time learning about us in the Republic.  I well recall that the Quakers were the facilitators and they gave us five minutes to write on the blackboard everything we thought of Unionism while the Unionists were outside of the room.  What was written on the blackboard provoked one of us to ask for ten minutes to get out of there before the Unionists read it.  The loyalists and Unionists did a similar exercise in another room and we then exchanged notes.  The perceptions of each other were stunning in terms of how wide of the mark they were.  That began an engagement and friendships that have lasted through the agreements and to the present day.  I still meet people I first met in 1992.Through the British Irish Association and other fora we managed to meet people and develop relationships.  That is what a parliamentary forum does, it breaks down barriers and opens mindsets and horizons.  I met the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly and he and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O'Donoghue, are pursuing this.  It is a matter for both parliamentary fora and we must allow them to bring this over the line.  The respective commissions plan to meet in October.  Sensitivities are involved but agreements can be arrived at and it is hoped this will happen.  It is the same with regard to the consultative forum and we will host a conference in the autumn to prime that and act as a catalyst in moving that agenda.  We had discussions of that at the last meeting.I take the points made on the Kelvin project in Fermanagh and west Cavan; I indicated that additional points of presence cannot be added to it but the ones in place should also benefit the surrounding areas of the towns involved as the Kelvin connectivity will increase competition for telecoms business.  This should lead to the provision of international connectivity at a reduced cost in the areas surrounding these points of presence.  We see it as a significant potential catalyst for further development.I agree with all that was said on health and hospital services.  Dr. Alasdair McDonnell, MP, MLA, asked whether there would be a freeflow of services and Deputy Crawford and Senator Ivana Bacik — I apologise for the mispronunciation; it is very warm here—

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Just as I began to speak about hospital services.I have long been committed to this and we have had many pilot projects and examinations of potential.  I was Minister for Health and Children more than five years ago and we examined similar episodes.  A new radiotherapy satellite centre in Altnagelvin is one that the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. McGimpsey suggested has cross-Border potential.  A feasibility study on cross-Border co-operation in the health sector is due to be concluded soon and the Centre for Cross-Broder Studies is planning a research project to examine how hospital services might be better provided on the Border.  To me there is obvious potential here.  We did one on kidney services which went very well with regard to patient referrals.  It should be possible to get practical arrangements between primary care practitioners and centres on both sides of the Border.For a long time we have endeavoured to develop Belfast and Derry connections for cancer services.  In paediatric services, when we were developing the heart transplant service in the Mater hospital it was often suggested that there could be synergies between North and South because volume of patients is critical for any transplant service.  One needs the requisite volume to maintain the expertise and activities.  In such specialties there is a real need for proactive, all-island approaches.  All-island protocols for oncology and paediatric cardiac services are critical.  We should probably accelerate all of these.In public health there has been very good co-operation between the institutes and service.  They have been very helpful.  For example, the co-operation between both chief medical officers on swine vesicular disease has been exemplary.  There has been very good agreement on both sides and they have been keeping each other updated.Deputy Crawford raised the all-island animal health regime.  Ministers for agriculture, North and South, discussed the progress on this strategy at the sectoral meeting last week.  Final agreement on the strategy is awaited from the Northern Ireland Executive.  In the meantime a cross-Border event is planned for the autumn to bring together key stakeholders to discuss the delivery of the strategy and this will help build genuine partnerships in the development of policy and enable stakeholders to plan a future work programme.  It is vital to get the farming constituency working on this.I dealt with sectarianism and discussed Monaghan General Hospital.  That is continuing and I have referred it to a colleague.  We have dealt with the North-South parliamentary forum.A number of members, including Senator Keaveney, raised the issue of sex offenders.  At the North-South Ministerial Council there have been discussions on proper co-operation between both authorities in ensuring compatibility in our protocols and guidelines.  That is work in progress.Senator Bacik raised the issue of sectarianism in the primary school system.  Our approach so far has been to address it on a community by community basis.  It is not a matter for us here, in one sense.  Education has proven to be complex and sensitive enough in the Executive.  I recently had a visit seeking our support for a very interesting project to introduce GAA to schools largely in Protestant, loyalist areas.  That is the kind of initiative from the ground up that will make the difference rather than something we might wish to impose from the top down.  We will give much encouragement to this.There has been progress towards devolution of policing and justice.  Parties in the Executive have been working together within the Assembly in terms of the committee.  There is further work to be done.  There is engagement with the British Government on a range of issues still to be resolved.  Our view is that sooner it happens the better for all concerned and we urge all parties to work constructively towards resolving this issue on a consensual basis.  Work is progressing on that basis.I appreciate what Senator Cassidy said about the forum and he underlined its importance.  I take Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point on the EU contribution.  I was not suggesting there is any risk to any funding.  On the value for money reports, there is no decision on publishing the various reports of the North-South bodies but we are very anxious to take that forward.  It was agreed that we would finish the reviews by the end of the year.  I take the point on the logic of an all-island economy.  Across the board we have witnessed very significant progress.  InterTrade Ireland has developed a variety of seedcorn and research and development programmes to link up SMEs on both sides of the Border.  There has also been progress on the roads projects, and such infrastructural projects are significant from an economic perspective.  The investment in Derry Airport is significant for connectivity to the north-west region.There is ongoing work on waterways and Tourism Ireland is perhaps the best example of an all-Ireland body that has had a real impact internationally in marketing the island of Ireland as one entity.  The places to which we market ourselves are far flung and one cannot market a small island twice.  There needs to be one clear message to get people into the island but they can decide to go where they wish after that and the various agencies in our regions are free to lure them as they desire.I have always been very keen to develop the economic side of the equation and a lot of synergies have been created.  Nevertheless, there is still huge potential and, perhaps because of what has happened historically, many businesses fail to look North and vice versa.  Outstanding work has been done in that regard but there is considerable room for further development.Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the value for money report and we have asked the review group to accelerate its work but we are happy with how it is turning out.  Deputy Michael Ahern asked about the peace walls and I have spoken with him about sectarianism. I have visited many of the areas involved and met many of the groups working at the interface to break down barriers.  Great work is being done on intercommunity projects and within disadvantaged communities.  We must support communities and help them to move forward and while much of the work in this area will be under the radar it is important that we continue doing it.

We also thank him for the very open responses he has given.  The committee has taken and will continue to take a very keen interest in the many issues that are being discussed at North-South Ministerial Council meetings and we will continue to monitor the progress of the work of the Council in the future.  We are very reassured by the Minister's strong commitment to attend our committee to report on these meetings.We wish the Minister and his colleagues every success at a very important Cabinet meeting this evening.  I acknowledge the presence of Ms Sarah McGrath from the Department of Foreign Affairs who co-ordinated the Minister's visit.  We are very grateful to her and her colleagues for their co-operation.Meetings of the committee are adjourned until September.  I will confirm the date for our next meeting at a later stage.  I am very grateful for the fact that 15 colleagues, particularly those travelling from Northern Ireland, have turned up for today's meeting despite the fact that it is the last Tuesday in July and the Galway Races are under way.  It shows their commitment to Parliament and its committees.Until we meet again, go raibh míle maith agat.  Tá an cruinniú thart.  Le cúnamh Dé, casfaimid le chéile arís.  Gabhaim buíochas leat.
