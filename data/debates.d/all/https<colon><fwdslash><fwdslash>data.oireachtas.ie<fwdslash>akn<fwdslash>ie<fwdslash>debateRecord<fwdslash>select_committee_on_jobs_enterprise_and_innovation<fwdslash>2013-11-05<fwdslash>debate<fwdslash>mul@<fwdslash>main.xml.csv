I welcome Deputy Sean Sherlock, Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with responsibility for research and innovation, and all his officials. I thank them for all the co-operation in recent months, especially through Ms Elaine Cassidy, to get to this stage. As this is one of the largest Bills in the history of the State, with the prior agreement of members we have set aside four days this week and the same next week for its consideration. In addition, we have booked Friday, 22 November and Friday, 29 November to conclude our consideration of the Bill if necessary. Is that agreed? Agreed. Should our consideration of the Bill on Thursday 14 November progress well, it would be proposed to sit later that night to conclude our consideration. Is that agreed? Agreed. As discussed in our private session the following arrangements will apply. Sections grouped in accordance with the list circulated to members will be disposed of by one question. I refer members to the grouping of amendments for the purpose of debate. We will now proceed to our consideration of the Bill.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	2	I move amendment No. 1:In page 74, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:“ “electronic means” or “electronic communications” includes the use of electronic mail;”.I thank the Chairman for hosting this meeting today. I will be advised by him on whether I should explain this amendment.

The Minister of State does not propose to go into detail on each one unless members specifically want him to. If members want more detail they can ask for it.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	4	I move amendment No. 2:In page 74, to delete line 46 and substitute “Consumer Credit Act 1995;”.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	5	I move amendment No. 3:In page 77, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“ “sealed”, other than in provisions governing the use of a company’s common seal or of any official seal of it, means executed in the manner specified in section 64 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 (but only to the extent that that section 64 obviates the need for a seal);”. Amendment agreed to.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	6	I am considering introducing amendments to section 2, as amended, on Report Stage. These amendments will tidy up the language used in the definition of "statutory auditor" by removing the incorrect reference at the beginning which states "(within the meaning of those Regulations)" and purport to clarify further how sole directors are treated within a company's constitution. I am aware that there is a need to define a system for the interconnection of registers which is provided for in Directive 2012/17/EU.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	7	I move amendment No. 4:In page 85, line 21, to delete “NACE Rev. 1” and substitute “NACE Rev. 2”. Sections 16 and 17 agreed to.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	8	Amendment No. 5 in the name of the Minister and amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 33 to 35, inclusive, in the name of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien are related and will be discussed together by agreement.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	9	I move amendment No. 5:In page 86, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:“Company to carry on activity in the State and prohibition of certain activities18. (1) A company shall not be formed or registered unless it appears to the Registrar that the company, when registered, will carry on an activity in the State.(2) A company shall not carry on the activity of a licensed bank or an insurance undertaking.”.I propose this amendment to give further clarification to the existing law.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	10	If amendment No. 5 is accepted, amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy O'Brien cannot be moved.

If the Deputy wishes to discuss it, he can do so before we vote on the Minister's amendment.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	13	I would like to get some background information from the Minister of State. My amendment relates to Irish-registered non-resident companies. A report published in 1998, which tackled this problem, stated that a company must carry out some activity but did not state that the company should be managed or controlled within the State. A report by the Department of Finance in 1998 recommended that this be addressed in some way. My amendment, with amendment No. 7, tries to do that. We say that not only should the company carry out some activity within the State but that it must also be managed and controlled within the State, particularly for tax purposes. We would like some feedback from the Minister of State on this amendment.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	14	This series of amendments inserts the words "managed and controlled" into sections of the Bill. The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance. The proposed amendments are illegal under EU law and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law of freedom of establishment, a core aspect of EU law. The European Commission closely monitors compliance with this law. The Commission has recently required Ireland to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland. This proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting these amendments.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	16	The Companies Registration Office, CRO, does not record that. I can try to ascertain some figures and respond to the Deputy at a later stage.

Is it for administrative purposes or is it too difficult to get that information?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	18	I do not have that information to hand and I am not in a position to answer that question but I am happy to try to facilitate the Deputy. If he tables a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance, I am sure that information would be forthcoming.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	19	I am happy enough to withdraw the amendments and revisit them on Report Stage once I receive that information.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	20	Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	21	I move amendment No. 8:In page 89, line 11, after "company" to insert "or be authenticated in the manner referred to in section 889".
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	22	I presume the amendment relates to company seals and authenticating them in the manner referred to in section 889.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	23	It refers to the statement to be delivered with the constitution. The amendment will provide for certain uses of electronic seals.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	24	I move amendment No. 9:In page 89, to delete lines 12 to 15 and substitute the following:"(b) be accompanied by a consent that is either—(i) signed by each of the persons named in the statement as a director, secretary or joint secretary or assistant or deputy secretary to act in that capacity, or(ii) authenticated in the manner referred to in section 889.”.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	25	I move amendment No. 10:In page 89, line 27, after "her" to insert ", or authenticated in the manner referred to in section 889,".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	26	I am considering tabling an amendment to the section on Report Stage to correct the incorrect cross-reference in subsection (3) from (b) to (a).
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	27	Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	28	I move amendment No. 11:In page 97, to delete lines 30 to 45 and in page 98, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:"39. (1) Where a company authorises any person as being a person entitled to bind the company (not being an entitlement to bind that is, expressly or impliedly, restricted to a particular transaction or class of transactions), it shall notify the Registrar in the prescribed form of the authorisation and the Registrar shall register the authorisation.(2) A person so authorised, where his or her authorisation is registered in the foregoing manner, is referred to in this Act as a “registered person”; where, in a provision of this Act, that expression appears without qualification, it shall be taken as a reference to a registered person authorised by the company to which the provision falls to be applied.(3) Where a company revokes an authorisation of a person as a person entitled to bind the company (being an authorisation notified to the Registrar in the prescribed form), the person shall, notwithstanding that revocation, continue to be regarded for the purposes of this Act as a registered person unless and until the company notifies the Registrar in the prescribed form of that revocation.".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	29	I move amendment No. 12:In page 98, to delete lines 12 and 13 and substitute the following:"(6) For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this section the provisions of a company’s constitution with regard to a person’s office or powers shall not, in themselves, be taken as an authorisation by the company of the person as a person entitled to bind the company.".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	30	I am considering tabling an amendment to the section on Report Stage, the purpose of which is to clarify that only one signature is required to provide for single director companies. Furthermore, I am considering adding the words "committee of the directors" to subsection (3) to correct an omission. Section 44 agreed to.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	31	I am considering tabling an amendment to the section on Report Stage to change the section back to the existing law as was intended by the CLRG.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	32	I move amendment No. 13:In page 103, lines 16 to 18, to delete all words from and including "on" in line 16 down to and including "office" in line 18 and substitute ", outside every office or place in which its business is carried on and at its registered office".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	34	I move amendment No. 14:In page 103, to delete line 21.

Is there a reason they do not have to put publish company names and addresses on business letters?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	36	The amendment proposes to avoid duplication with section 152(4), which requires a company to display its name in a prominent and easily accessible place on its website and addresses the scenario whereby a company carries on its business away from its registered office.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	37	When a company sends a business letter, it will not be under an obligation to include the company name and address. The section states: "A company—(a) shall display its name in a conspicuous position, in letters easily legible" and then refers to "all business letters of the company", which is the line the Minister of State proposes to delete.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	38	The explanatory memorandum refers to the particulars to be shown on all business letters of a company. Section 152 states: "Subject to subsection (4), a company shall, in all business letters on or in which the company’s name appears and which are sent by the company to any person, state in legible characters in relation to every director of the company" a list of particulars, which are outlined. That should avoid duplication. I hope that answers the question.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	40	I move amendment No. 15:In page 103, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:"(4) This section is without prejudice to section 152.". Section 51 agreed to.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	41	I move amendment No. 16:In page 104, to delete lines 19 to 25 and substitute the following:"(b) if the company has not given notice to the Registrar of the situation of its registered office, by delivering it to the Registrar.".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	42	I move amendment No. 17:In page 104, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(3) It shall be the duty of the Registrar to enter on the register a document that has, by the means referred to in subsection (1)(b), been served on a company.".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	44	I move amendment No. 18:In page 105, line 36, after "articles" to insert "and subject to subsection (3) of that section".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	45	I am considering introducing an amendment to section 59 in order to clarify whether Parts 1 to 15, inclusive, of the Bill apply to an existing company upon delivery of its constitution or following the registration of the constitution by the registrar.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	46	Why are so many amendments proposed to be introduced on Report Stage? Could they not have been tabled on Committee Stage? Is it the case that they were only devised in the past few days?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	47	They have not been devised in the past few days. The sheer volume of amendments meant there were certain pressures in regard to the drafting of the Bill. I have given some latitude to the drafters in terms of the pressures they faced. I hope members, likewise, will make allowances for that and engage with the proposals on Report Stage.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	48	To clarify, we decided last May or June that these meetings would take place this week, and it was anticipated that a large number of amendments would be submitted in the course of the summer. That proved to be the case, and we have more than 150 proposals to work through. We want to get through Committee Stage, but it is important that members are aware that they can discuss any issue that arises. In fact, a proposal can only go forward on Report Stage if it has been discussed here. If members have any concerns about anything the Minister of State has raised, I urge them to address it today. There is plenty of opportunity to debate any such issues.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	49	Will the Minister of State give some indication of the number of amendments he proposes to bring forward on Report Stage, or is he just going to pull something out of the hat on each section?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	50	The objective here is to consolidate an item of legislation that is the size of a telephone book.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	51	I understand that. I am concerned that a principle might be at play here whereby new proposals would be pulled out of the hat on Report Stage.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	52	I do not accept that there is any sense of pulling anything out of the hat in terms of the substance of the legislation. Section 59 is effectively a new section which stipulates that during the transition period, the law applicable to an existing private company limited by shares will be contained in Part 16. There is still some work to be done on that. I ask members for some latitude in terms of the sheer volume of the legislation. I am proceeding in accordance with the protocol that we notify the committee of our intent to introduce amendments on Report Stage. There is no attempt to pull anything out of the hat at the last minute in terms of the entirety of the procedure. However, there are issues that will arise between now and Report Stage.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	53	To reiterate, members as free to ask questions relating to any issue which the Minister of State has indicated will be brought forward on Report Stage. I assure members that any outstanding concerns they might have will be dealt with by way of a briefing session after Committee Stage and before Report Stage. We have had very useful briefings from the Department on numerous occasions in the past. If there is a list of new amendments on Report Stage, we can have a briefing session, as we have done before. Report Stage will take place on the floor of the Dáil and there will be unlimited time at that stage to discuss any issue. There is no agenda here to slip proposals through without debate.

I am not concerned that anything will be pulled out of the hat.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	55	To clarify, there is no intention to make substantive changes to the law itself in terms of its qualitative aspect. However, there has been some engagement since Second Stage with practitioners, in the light of which several amendments will be introduced on Report Stage. The word "technical" is not quite correct, but their purpose will essentially be to make the law more efficient in the longer term. That is the main reason I expect to bring forward further amendments on Report Stage.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	57	I move amendment No. 19:In page 108, line 24, to delete "regulations." and substitute the following:"regulations; for the avoidance of doubt, the requirements of sections 19 and 26(1) relating to a company’s name shall apply despite any exemption of the kind referred to in section 62(3) that had been enjoyed by the company under the prior Companies Acts.".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	61	I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and to ensure the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is consistently applied within the provisions of the Bill. In regard to section 65, I am considering Report Stage amendments to insert a cross-reference to section 70 and to clarify that the payment to a third party is the discharge of a liability owed by the company to that third party or otherwise adds value to the company.Otherwise the manner in which the section is worded may be interpreted as allowing, in effect, for shares to be allotted at a discount.

The review group recommended that the general provision for bearer shares should be abolished by way of an express prohibition and that transitional arrangements should be provided to take account of companies that may have legitimately issued bearer shares in the past. This prohibition should not affect the position governing renounceable letters of allotment of fully or partly paid-up bonus shares or beneficial interests in shares, and arrangements should be put in place to take account of the specific regulatory regime for collective investment funds.

This amendment aims to clarify this intention by expressly providing that a body corporate may be a shadow director. It is hoped that this restriction may curtail Ireland's reputation as a tax haven. What we are trying to do is bring more clarity. We have individuals or companies, be they limited or otherwise, advising companies without being directors of those companies. This amendment gives the courts an opportunity to attach liability to where the advice is coming from and to attach responsibility on the part of the individual concerned. By inserting this amendment, we are making it clearer to ensure there is more light and transparency.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	154	I understand the Deputy's proposal. I am advised that his suggestion is part of the law as it stands and that, therefore, no amendment is required. Under section 18 of the Interpretation Act, a person includes a body corporate. This is why the definition is not explained specifically in this section. It has been upheld in the High Court in Fyffes plc v DCC plc & ors, IEHC 477, and in the Supreme Court in respect of the liquidation of Worldport Ireland Limited in 2008. Therefore, the law is sufficient as it stands and I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.

At the moment, saying that the directors shall have regard to employees is not a duty. While acknowledging that the primary duty of a company is to its members and to ensuring they are sustainable from a financial point of view, there should be more protection for employees and there should be a duty to them in the interests of corporate responsibility. Stipulating that the directors shall have regard to their employees has no strength because it does not represent a duty and is just a token gesture. If we were to include the employees, it would not mean that the employees would always be seen to be in the right in a dispute but it would give the courts an opportunity to interpret it as they saw fit depending on the information put before them.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	163	Under existing law, directors are required to have regard to the interests of employees. This amendment would change it to a duty to employees. This may mean that members and employees would have a directly enforceable right against directors where they act contrary to their respective interests. This would compromise the fundamental structure of the directors' relationship with the company, which is described to be fiduciary, that is to say it requires directors to prefer the interests of the company over their interests or those of others, even where those others include some members of the company. The amendment puts into question the status of the law of oppression, which is the principal protection of minority shareholders under the current law and much of the employment law. Such a vague and general declaration of a duty without any explanation as to how it interacts with existing law would serve to create great uncertainty in company law. This is directly contrary to one of the key objectives of the Bill, which is to clarify directors' duties. The amendment may also breach constitutional property rights. Ultimately, bolstering protections for employees should be done using employment law. These provisions only serve to complicate company law and do nothing to protect employees of partnerships and sole traders and public employees. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.

It is probably better addressed within employment law but perhaps the Government needs to look at that because there is no indication that we will address the area of employees under company law. The Minister of State comes from a county where we saw a pretty high-profile dispute last year about employees in a company that was going into liquidation, so there is certainly room for improvement in respect of employees' rights and conditions. While this may not be the legislation to deal with it, I understand where Deputy Wallace is coming from. It is something that must be dealt with and if it is not going to be dealt with in this legislation for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State, it probably needs to be dealt with by another committee in respect of employment legislation.

Employment law does not have the capacity to cover all situations where employees' interests are not being catered for by the company in a fair manner. Including this amendment, which puts an obligation on companies to behave with a greater sense of responsibility to their employees, might be different. It would not be the way things happen in most of the developed world. That is because of the privileges given to companies. While I understand that we would not have them if they did not have certain privileges, I believe that the protection of employees' interests in certain situations should be strengthened. For example, employment law is not much good to one when companies are going out of business. This amendment would give greater protection to employees.

It extends the obligations on directors in respect of their compliance statements to cover not only tax and company law, but also public interest considerations such as environmental, health and safety and employment law. It is hoped that this will encourage a wider sense of corporate responsibility towards society and shared natural resources rather than just towards a company itself. In today's language, these amount to externalities and are not considered as being costs to the company. Externalities are unintended side effects of the market economy and are the impact of commercial transactions that fall outside the two parties to that transaction. For example, when a consumer buys gardening tools and materials, a positive externality is experienced by others in the community, as the consumer uses those materials to make an attractive garden from which everyone in the community can gain enjoyment and benefit. On the other hand, if a consumer hires a contractor to cut down the trees on his or her property in order to park an extra car, the community experiences a negative externality, as the scenic beauty, shade, animal habitat and fresh air provided by the trees are lost. Externalities can be positive or negative. For the companies that organise the production of goods and services in the professional economy, however, they are to be ignored. Since externalities do not directly affect the responsible parties, profitability is not harmed by them. This principle has led to significant economic impacts. For example, the large-scale outsourcing of America's mass production has had considerable effect, including the decline of large urban regions due to depressed demand, resulting in increased rates of crime, family strain and domestic abuse. These are external side effects of corporate investment strategies, as they do not directly hurt earnings. Too often, capital is pushed forward despite these side effects. The world would be a better place if companies had a responsibility to consider externalities.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	176	Notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy has been brushing up on his neo-Marxist economic theory - it sounds vaguely familiar from my college days - this question was dealt with comprehensively by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in its 2005 report on directors' compliance statements. If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business. The set-up cost for a business was an estimated €90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at €40,000. A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas. Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties. More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement. There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries. The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.

While there is such a thing as red tape that has no benefit for anyone, much of it was designed to ensure that companies behaved in a certain manner, even in their own best interests. In the past 20 years, companies have made many decisions that were not in their best long-term interests. For example, some companies are making decisions based on three-month thinking because everything is driven by the markets and what they can sell. The companies are not concerned about where they will be in five years' time. There is nothing to stop them from making decisions that are not in the interests of their long-term health. Claiming that companies that have regard to the environment and take a more direct duty towards health and safety and employment law will not be able to compete amounts to a race to the bottom. That is where we are heading in a canoe without a paddle.

To a certain extent, I understand the motive behind the amendment, but one must factor into the equation a corpus of environmental, health and safety and employment law. The issue of negative or positive externalities does not arise. We must ensure that there is robust legislation. Every citizen is subject to the existing corpus of law and companies are legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.That is already inherent, thereby rendering the amendment unsupportable in that sense.

Subsection (4) states:Those circumstances are where the director has been appointed or nominated for appointment by that member, being a member who has an entitlement to so appoint or nominate under the company’s constitution or a shareholders’ agreement. Is there a vagueness around that knowledge that could be used to defend inappropriate behaviour on the part of a director in the interests of a friend or family member?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	191	The purpose of this amendment is clarificatory in nature. The current text refers to the directors having a duty to have regard to the interests of members in addition to the general duty owed to employees under section 225. However, section 225 does not impose such a duty on directors to their employees. Section 225 provides that the matters to which the directors are to have regard in the performance of their functions shall include the interests of the company's employees in general. I hope that clarifies the matter further for the Deputy.

There is a vagueness in the language that may allow for a director to justify inappropriate behaviour.

However, that may be contradictory to the obligation on directors to act in the best interests of the company. Therefore, this could offer somebody a way out of acting in the best interests of the company if this language is not tightened up to clarify exactly what it means by stating "that a director of a company may have regard to the interests of a particular member of the company".

Upon incorporation of a company, the Companies Registration Office shall issue to all listed directors a document setting our a summary of this Chapter in plain language, to include the duties provided for and the consequences for breach of such duties.This allows for the dissemination of a director's duties as set out in Part 5. The purpose of this codified version of the duties, which currently exists in a combination of common law and statutory provisions, is to act as a signpost as to the standard of conduct expected of directors.  This amendment will facilitate the wider dissemination of these duties to all new directors upon the incorporation of a company. This would educate them fully on their responsibilities and, in a broader sense, promote a culture of corporate responsibility. Currently, this role is fulfilled by a solicitor at the expense of the company and many start-up companies do not have the means for such legal advice. Also, where there are volunteer directors, for example, in the property management sector - there are many of them around Dublin city at the moment - who are also subject to additional requirements under the Multi Unit Developments Act 2011, they may not have the means to seek legal advice regarding the legal duties owed by them.  People take too much for granted concerning what directors know about their responsibilities. We could address this matter in this manner and it would be positive to do so.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	197	Such documents are already in circulation and are available free from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement's website. The Companies Registration Office already sends these documents to directors of newly formed companies. However, because most companies are formed by company formation's businesses, the documents generally do not get to the directors at all. More important in this respect is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10, that is to say, before they receive the paper copy. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment. However, even though this is not a matter for primary legislation, I acknowledge that the idea is a good one. For this reason, I will consider introducing a live link to the relevant ODCE documents so that directors can read and understand their duties online before completing the electronic form when it becomes available.

I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is important. Even the issue of voluntary directors is becoming more prevalent. Particularly in an area in which both myself and Deputy Wallace would have an interest such as the League of Ireland, we are seeing a lot more companies being run by supporters who are taking over football clubs and appointing directors. It happened in my own case. It would be useful, therefore, to have that live link. There is obviously an obligation on a director to get that information and to understand his or her duties, but we should make the information as accessible as possible.

I recently joined the board of a crèche and have not yet got around to reading a large amount of documents.There is only so far one can go. If there is an issue with the access of the language that is a different issue altogether. The Minister of State has made it clear that there is no shortage of material available in regard to the obligations on people who set up companies of which they become directors. The problem is getting people to read it. It is up to the individuals concerned to do so. As I said earlier, I accept that if the language is not accessible for some people that might be an issue. However, there is no shortage of ways of accessing the particular information.

The idea was to operate them for as long as we could following which the owners of the apartments would take them over. That has been the practice for a number of years. The level of trouble coming down the tracks in regard to management companies in Dublin is frightening. There are huge problems with them. People who have become voluntary directors on these management companies do not know what they signed up for but will find out when they end up in court. Would it be possible to provide that people intending to take up positions as voluntary directors on management companies attend, perhaps, a one-day course in regard to the responsibilities involved and the pitfalls in that regard? I do not believe the people signing up to these management companies fully understand what they are letting themselves in for.

I am a voluntary director. One of the key issues is the volume of material which people must read. Most do not do so and simply take on board what they believe are the responsibilities of a director. A key issue is to ensure use of simple and understandable language rather than legal jargon of the type we have to put up with on a daily basis.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	206	I do not think anybody would disagree with the sentiments expressed. This is not a matter for primary legislation. It could be dealt with through the ODCE and CRO simplifying the language or ensuring that people are made aware in the starkest terms of their obligations in relation to any legal entity of which they become part. That is perhaps all one can do. If somebody decides to become part of a community-voluntary body or legal entity, there is only so much that the State or Government can do to legislate in respect of that decision. One would expect that people when signing up to such bodies are fully aware of their obligations. People have a personal responsibility to find out their obligations. If it is possible to simplify the language around those obligations the matter should be taken up by the ODCE and CRO.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	218	This is not a logical inclusion in a company's financial statements. Financial statements relate to the company's financial performance and not its tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government were to require businesses to obtain and publish a certificate of tax compliance it would do so in tax law to catch both company and all non-company businesses that also pay taxes. The introduction of this requirement would be entirely without precedent in Europe. I am not, therefore, in favour of accepting the amendment.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	228	Since group financial statements relate to a corporate group, the group financial statements of a subsidiary, which is also a parent company, would not give any more information than the group accounts of the company at the top of the corporate group. Therefore deletion of this exemption would benefit no one other than the lawyers and accountants who would have to prepare and file thousands more group financial statements than they do at present. Many foreign direct investment companies rely on this exemption to avoid having to prepare intermediate level group accounts that simply replicate a part of their general top level group accounts. The economic benefit of investing in Ireland would be substantially eroded by requiring these companies to prepare many different sets of group accounts. This would also be a departure from established international practice. Most notably this exemption exists in the United Kingdom. This deletion might constitute a breach of articles 7, 8 and 11 of the seventh accounting directive. For those reasons I am not in favour of changing the section.

In the case of an Irish-registered but non-resident company which is a holding company or a subsidiary company, and which is just based on activity and is managed and controlled outside the State, are we saying that the group accounts would cover the activities of the particular company that is registered within the State? Could any company registered in the State be exempt from making returns under the group financial returns the Minister of State mentioned?

This is effectively avoiding a duplication or proliferation of reporting mechanisms. The Deputy seems to seek greater clarity on those companies that are Irish-registered but non-resident companies. Section 301 reads: "Subject to its not having elected to prepare IFRS group financial statements and to subsection (4), a holding company is exempt from the requirement to prepare group financial statements if the holding company (the “lower holding company”) is itself a subsidiary undertaking and its holding undertaking is not established under the laws of an EEA state and one or other of the following cases applies." It continues to list exemptions and so on. I am trying to get to the nub of the question.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	242	I have a quick question on the definition of shares. My understanding is that the definition of shares in section 306(5) applies to shares quoted on any securities or other markets referred to in section 1071. Under my reading, that would exclude shares quoted on the Nasdaq or the SEC. Therefore, if a director was to make gains on a company based on the Nasdaq or the SEC, those gains could be exempted from being disclosed. Is that the case?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	243	There is no proposed amendment here. The issue Deputy Calleary raises has been referred to the Company Law Review Group.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	245	Truthfully, I do not anticipate that we will have it by Report Stage.

Should we look for disclosure of audit fees? There is a vagueness relating to fees charged. Does the Minister of State believe company law should be consistent with the 2006 directive on statutory audits?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	249	The 2006 directive is not a maximum harmonisation directive and therefore there is no obligation under European Union law not to gold plate its provisions. The suggestion is, therefore, inessential given that the Bill's provisions are drawn from existing law and that the proposed change would facilitate concealment of fees by falsely categorising them as expenses. Question proposed: "That section 337 stand part of the Bill."
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	250	I am considering introducing an amendment to section 337 on Report Stage. The cross-referencing in the section is incorrect.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	265	The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, which is a statutory body, is the umbrella organisation that has charge of or would monitor or audit the auditors in that sense. However, given the question has been raised, I am minded to revert to the Deputy with a more complete answer on the exact question he asked, if that is all right.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	269	Did that body answer that question?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	271	Okay. It is proposed to strengthen that aspect and to change it to reflect the concerns.

My worry is that the section would be used to dilute the requirements of sections 367 to 369, inclusive. Does the Minister of State have thoughts on this with regard to Report Stage?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	273	I can take a look at that before Report Stage. Is there particular language that must be built into it?
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	274	The provisions of section 371 refer to how an audit opinion is valid "from the date of signature" and I believe there is a lack of clarity in section 37(5) as to the meaning of what is "a true and fair view as at the date [of] the original ... financial statements", whereas section 367 is quite precise regarding dates in respect of the original statutory statement. The worry is that section 371 allows for a material event to be missed or to be excluded from the final revised accounts, whereas sections 367 to 369, inclusive, are quite specific.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	275	While this matter has been referred to the company law review group, I will give the Deputy some thoughts on it here. The question effectively pertains to the requirement that an audit give a true and fair view sufficiently robust to ensure accurate accounting. That is the aspect.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	276	I also have concerns that a revised order not miss some material event that happened when the original financial statements were prepared.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	277	Fair enough. As EU law requires that statutory audits give a true and fair view, this already is inherent within EU law. While I will not go into the particulars of the directive, Article 35 states "an audit opinion, which shall be either unqualified, qualified or an adverse opinion and shall state clearly the opinion of the statutory auditor ... as to whether the annual financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework". Thus, any change to the current phrasing in section 337 could contravene EU law. On the question of the revised audit and begging the committee's indulgence, I propose to revert to it on Report Stage with a fuller response.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	278	I move amendment No. 70:In page 376, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:“(6) If the original statutory financial statements or directors’ report in respect of the company have been registered by the Registrar prior to the date of receipt by the Registrar of the revised financial statements or (as the case may be) the revised directors’ report, then, despite anything in section 374(2), this section shall operate so as to require—(a) that the revised financial statements or (as the case may be) the revised directors’ report be placed on the register; and(b) notwithstanding the taking of such action, that the original statutory financial statements or directors’ report continue to remain on the register.”.

It also accommodates the increasing reliance on self-assessment and tax law by changing "assessed taxes" to "assessable taxes".

That will give us an opportunity to go through all of the proposed amendments for Report Stage. We can also discuss any other information and matters similar to this one. Members will have an opportunity to discuss all of those matters at a briefing session, if that is agreeable to them. We can add the transition period to the list for discussion, if need be.

The period seems long, particularly when there is not much new material in the section, which seems to be an amalgamation of a wide range of legislation.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	411	The maximum period is 18 months but it can be done straight away. Let us remember that the provision addresses the "restoration of companies that are struck off and dissolved prior to the enactment of the Bill or during the transition period and to deal with the restoration of companies after the end of the transition period." That lasts for up to 18 months or so but a company could move more quickly.

As he will know, in the case of any Bill consultations take place with a number of stakeholders. There may be a departmental view, there will be a CRO view and there may even be a Revenue view on the matter. The original figure is six months but, following consultation with various stakeholders, it was felt that a figure of three months would be the most expeditious period, rather than 30 days.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	456	Effectively, Part 13 substantially re-enacts without any significant amendment the law regarding the appointment of inspectors to companies and seeks to codify all of the law relating to the investigation of companies. Therefore, the principal changes are the updating of definitions and terminology, facilitating access to the investigation procedure for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, facilitating the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, by empowering the court to make orders in respect of a variety of matters under the Part and, importantly, removing administrative burdens. In that sense, the answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	468	It brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions found in existing legislation, a change that will provide greater transparency. The giving and acceptance of restriction and disqualification undertakings from directors are facilitated, thereby saving costs and court time. One of the Bill's most far-reaching reforms involves the introduction of a new four-tier categorisation of offences. This follows on from a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. It is proposed that, except for the most serious offences, namely, fraudulent trading and market abuse, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme. At the higher end of the scale, category 1 offences carry, following conviction on indictment, a term of imprisonment of up to ten years and-or a €500,000 fine.A further new provision allows a trial court to order a person convicted under the Bill to remedy any breach thereof in respect of which he or she is convicted.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	471	One of the questions that has arisen in relation to this section is around prosecutions of breaches of company law and whether the Bill will rectify this issue. The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate. The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed. Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers. Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender. As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted. This must be taken into account in terms of the context of this section. Section 798 as drafted under existing law is unchanged.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	472	This section is also substantially unchanged from that provided in existing law. However, the court may make an order restraining a company or an officer of the company from removing his or her assets from the State or reducing those assets below a specified amount. This extends to the current law in that it also applies to the company and not, as provided under existing law, only to officers of a company. The circumstances in which an injunction can be granted are now limited to cases where the primary cause of action also arises under this Bill. Alternatively, the cause of action must arise under the provisions of the constitution of the company or relate to the holding of an office of the company. Question proposed: "That section 800 stand part of the Bill."
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	473	This is a new section, the purpose of which is to give guidance on the meaning of the terms "disclosure order" and "share acquisition agreement" under this Part.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	474	Again, this is a new section, the purpose of which is to give the court a supplemental power in relation to share acquisition agreements where it has grounds to believe that all the information sought to be obtained by the disclosure order will not be so obtained by a person against whom the order is made and who is a party or former party to a share acquisition agreement. In such circumstances, the court may make an order requiring any other party or former party to the share acquisition agreement to give information to the court in relation to matters affecting the application of section 807 as it applies to the share acquisition agreement. The court may exercise this power on the making of an application for a disclosure order or at any time subsequent to this an application to the court by a person having a financial interest in the company or by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	494	The section has some changes when compared with the existing legislation. It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director. The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company. The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels. It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted. The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group. The additional requirement is that the person concerned "...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company". The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator. Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company. Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital. The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than €100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. In the case of an investment company, subsection (3) will be read as if the requirements are that the value of the issued share capital of the company is not less than €100,000 and that an amount of not less than €100,000 in cash has been paid in consideration for the allotment of shares in the company, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. A person restricted arising from his or her conduct in relation to a company limited by shares is restricted as regards all other company types as well.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	504	This section is new and provides that "the Summary Approval Procedure" may not be utilised by "a company that has a restricted person" except in circumstances where that procedure is being used to affect a member's voluntary winding up.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	505	We are considering introducing an amendment to section 829(2) on Report Stage. The purpose of this amendment will be to make reference to "member" rather than a "subscriber of the constitution".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	506	I am considering introducing an amendment to section 841 on Report Stage to provide that foreign disqualification orders made before the commencement of the Bill be declared. This is a new section to deal with a situation in which a director becomes disqualified under the law of another state. In such a case, where the company fails to notify the registrar of such a situation, as required by section 150(8) of this Bill, the relevant director will be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order for a period not exceeding the remaining period of the foreign disqualification. This section is new and tightens up the position under the current law whereby a person is only required to notify the registrar of their disqualification under the law of another state upon becoming a director of a company and not where the foreign disqualification occurs subsequent to their becoming a director of an Irish company. Question put and agreed to.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	507	This is a new section. It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions, such as fraudulent trading and market abuse, the majority of offences under the Companies Acts should be classified according to a four-tier system. As I outlined earlier, category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine, currently set at €6,394 by the Fines Act 2010, previously £5,000. That is an amount no greater than the District Court can impose for any other criminal offence. Category 3 offences will likewise be prosecutable only summarily but on conviction may give rise to a prison sentence of up to six months or a class A fine or both.  Both category 2 and category 1 offences attract the same consequences when prosecuted summarily, namely, a class A fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Both these categories may also be prosecuted on indictment. In such a case, a category 2 offence will attract a fine of not more than €50,000 or a prison term not exceeding five years or both. A category 1 offence will have a penalty of a fine of not more than €500,000 or up to ten years in prison or both.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	541	I move amendment No. 107:In page 705, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:“Civil enforcement of prohibition on trading under misleading name876. (1) On the application of the Registrar or the Director, the court may order that a person shall cease, within the time specified in the order, to carry on any trade, profession or business in contravention of section 27(1) if that person has—(a) been convicted of an offence under section 27(2);(b) been served with a notice by the Registrar or Director requiring that person to cease to carry on a trade, profession or business in contravention of section 27(1); and(c) failed to comply with the notice within 14 days after the date of service of the notice, or such greater period as may be specified in the notice in that behalf.(2) In making an order under subsection (1) the court may order that all costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the person against whom the order is made.”.The purpose of the amendment is to ensure all company types are covered by the offence of trading under a false name. The amendment extends the prohibition to designated activity companies.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	543	I wish to clarify this in my own mind because we are all getting a bit confused after 107 amendments.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	549	I am considering introducing an amendment to section 878(1)(b) on Report Stage. The purpose of this amendment will be to correct a missing reference in subsection (1)(b) that ought to read "book or document".

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	555	I am considering tabling an amendment to section 884(2) on Report Stage. The purpose of this amendment would be to correct the reference to subsection (1).
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	556	I propose to table an amendment to section 886 on Report Stage.

It contains transitional provisions relating to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority or IAASA, provides for the continuance of the IAASA and the preservation of its membership except in so far as it is changed by section 903 and other provisions allowing for termination, change and an increase of its membership.

Stakeholders with an interest will be prescribed. Practitioners and those with an interest in accounting matters should have formal representation on the board of the IAASA, as opposed to being there at the discretion of the Minister.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	562	They are there, as I understand it.

There will be two nominees from the accountancy sector and the remaining board membership will be made up of nominees from various agencies.

Would the Minister of State consider prescribing that? For instance, if a Minister was unfriendly towards business he or she might decide not to use that discretion.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	568	It would be rare to have a Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who is not business friendly. Let us be honest about it.

Perhaps the Minister of State could examine the matter for Report Stage.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	570	Government policy at present, as members know, is to reduce the number of people on boards, which is pertinent in terms of the public purse. We can take the matter back to the Minister, Deputy Bruton. There is no problem in having another look at it, with the Chairman's agreement.

I know we are going to discuss it with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, but I wanted to raise that issue again.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14944	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage	575	I acknowledge the point made by the Deputy.
