Senators Finucane, Leyden and Daly may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As she prepares for the Order of Business tomorrow, is the Leader aware of the provisional arrangement to hold a debate on the Estimates at 3.30 p.m?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	3	That is a mistake. I regret very much that the House was notified of an incorrect time as a result of human error. The debate on the Estimates will take place between 1.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. tomorrow.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	4	That is a significant improvement and I am glad of the clarification. I have a number of questions to put to the Leader regarding the Estimates. In relation to the Labour Party motion, which my party fully endorses, will the Government side permit a free vote given the number of backbenchers who support the sentiments expressed in it?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	5	We have a voice in the parliamentary party.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I assure the Leader that there will be a free vote on this side of the House.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I will be voting with the Government.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	8	As one investor to another.A Government decision taken two months before the recent Estimates made provision for a significant increase in ministerial salaries and pension provisions. Does the Leader believe it is incumbent on the Government to backtrack on this given the savage cuts proposed in the Estimates, the most insignificant of which is the first-time buyer's grant? The more significant issue is the proposed €2 billion reduction in the Estimates for public services. Does she not believe the Government has a moral responsibility to practise what it preaches and renege on the quite sizeable increase in its own salaries and pensions announced eight weeks prior to the publication of the Book of Estimates?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Has the Government any plans to ask the European Union to ensure that internationally there are regulations governing the kind of craft that ply through EU waters? I am thinking, in particular, of the disaster of the Prestige, a most unfortunate name for a boat. This type of incident has happened previously on several occasions. It is not acceptable that there should be this kind of international envelope of registration, as a result of which we do not know who owns the boat or what safety regulations are in place. This will have a huge impact on Spanish fishing. The Spanish were very irresponsible in insisting that the boat be pushed further out to sea. It has created a disaster in their own waters and they will now be more insistent in trying to get into our waters to rape the fish from our stocks that they neglected.I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to look, through the relevant committee, at the dictatorial way in which the Ceann Comhairle possesses the meeting room downstairs. Members in the Engineering Block, in particular, have no place where they can meet people in wheelchairs.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Accommodation is not a matter for the floor of this House.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It should be. Senators are very aggrieved.I want to raise two other matters, one of which was raised last week by Senator O'Toole, that is, the question of the monitors in the House. He queried the reason they were in place. There was a humorous play on it. It would be very helpful if the names of Senators were indicated as it would be of enormous help in identifying new Members, of whom there is such an enormous influx. I read in The Irish Times last week of a Senator “Marie, say yes,” an Independent Senator who spoke at some length. I would like to meet the lady. It does not sound from her surname that she is an Independent at all. It sounds as if she is a Taoiseach's nominee.   I want to follow up on the excellent inquiry of Senator Mansergh last week and ask the Leader if there has been any further development in the matter which relates to the threat by republicans to the lives of workmen reinstating the monument erected by the loyal citizens of Kingstown in commemoration of a visit by her late Imperial Majesty, Queen Victoria. Is there an up-date on the issue?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The issue of the monitors will be raised with the broadcasting unit.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I endorse the sentiments expressed by the leader of the Fine Gael group. We look forward to the debate on the first-time house buyer's grant this evening. I agree also that it is probably the most eye catching and headline catching of a number of very serious cuts.One issue to which we should direct our attention, on which I ask the Leader to organise a debate, is the effect of freezing overseas development aid. We all recall that the former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, Deputy O'Donnell, negotiated a multiannual deal with the Department of Finance, very much contrary to its instincts and what it wanted, which would have effectively seen us meeting the UN target by 2007. Scarcely was the door closed on Deputy O'Donnell than her successor began to reduce the budget, notwithstanding the hypocritical remarks of the Taoiseach in Johannesburg a few weeks later. This would be an appropriate time for us to take stock of where we are and, more importantly, where we are going in regard to our overseas commitments.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I join Senator Norris in asking the Leader to seek clarification on the type of vessels being used, including their health and safety requirements, in the light of the recent disaster involving the Prestige off the Spanish coast. Will the Leader have a word with the Minister tomorrow when dealing with the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill about what is going on in the Department in regard to the monitoring of this disaster and the implications for our fish stocks? I understand the Galicia bank is in serious danger. What are the implications for our fish stocks on the south coast and the coastline in general in regard to the protection of our beaches?
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I want to raise an issue which is important to the credibility of this House and the respect given in other countries, especially the USA. While I do not dispute the honourable intentions of Senator White in going to Colombia, I ask her, in the interests of this House, to reconsider her decision to travel for the trial.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Hear, hear.

After raising some weeks ago the matter of the three Irishmen facing trial there, I was disappointed to receive hate mail. I also received hate mail in the past when campaigning on human rights issues. I compliment Senator White and wish her well on her human rights mission. One of the reasons that so many suffered so much from miscarriages of justice in the past was that too few did too little, too late.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank Senator Finucane for raising this matter and congratulate all those Members of this and the other House who withdrew from the proposed visit to Colombia. It is important that we hear from the Leader of the House Government policy on sending representatives. All the Members who intended to go have, in their wisdom, withdrawn because they do not want to be used as propaganda tools for the IRA. I endorse those who believe Senator White's visit is unwise.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Is the Senator seeking a debate?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I am asking the Leader a question, as you probably heard, a Chathaoirligh. We have an ambassador out there, presumably doing an excellent job, who is looking after the rights of the people concerned. It would be wrong and confuse the issue if people were to come back and make highly politicised statements, which is what I predict. This is a very dangerous area.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Senator has made his point.

I notice the complete silence on the one issue causing real trouble in the public service – benchmarking. Why can we not have a full and frank debate on benchmarking? Why can we not start in this House by saying about the main beneficiaries of benchmarking—

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I had intended to raise the issue of flooding but it will be discussed tonight when Senator Morrissey raises it on the Adjournment. It has had an impact on many people in Dublin city and County Meath.Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine urgently the situation where a number of people are seeking compensation from the State as a result of the Supreme Court's decision on interim barring orders? It must be addressed because it is having a severe impact on families who are now waiting up to 12 weeks for the interim barring order. Unless this is dealt with quickly, it will cause a great deal of distress for those families and for the men in question. We must uphold everyone's constitutional rights. The Minister should come into the House to debate the issue.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	47	We have often spoken about road safety and I have congratulated the National Road Safety Council on the advertisements it has placed. I was jolted when I learned that our public service broadcaster this week withdrew an advertisement from the National Road Safety Council because of an objection from one of its advertisers. The advertiser of the motor car which appeared in the NRSC advertisement was concerned that there might be an association in the public mind between that motor car and the accident. I do not believe there would be any such thing. It is a disgrace that a public service broadcaster is at the behest of a commercial company. This company sponsors "The Late Late Show" and demanded that the advertisement be withdrawn because its motor car appeared in it. There should be a clear line between commercial influences and public service broadcasting or newspaper reporting. The Government should investigate this matter.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I support Senator Quinn's remarks about the withdrawal of that advertisement. It was made in the public service and dealt with a very serious issue.Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister, be that the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to clarify the situation regarding legislation covering surrogate parenting, particularly in relation to Irish couples who are using services abroad? There is no legal framework in this State and this could cause serious difficulties in the future for Irish couples making such arrangements and Irish clinics which are organising them.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced his intention to introduce wide-ranging legislation to reform the Garda Síochána. In the interests of the debate on the future role of the Garda Síochána, will the Minister come into the House to hear our views before the legislation is introduced, with a view to enhancing it?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	49	What action, if any, does the Leader intend to take to prevent further criticism of Mr. Justice Flood, as happened last week, especially since public hearings begin today? Last week Senator Mansergh openly criticised Mr. Justice Flood and further made outrageous statements with regard to the appropriateness of the appointment of Mr. Burke as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on merit—

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In view of the serious cutbacks in the Estimates and in the national development plan I ask Leader of the House to arrange for a debate on the BMW region. I have sought this debate on numerous occasions. We need a debate now because the BMW region is not getting its fair share of the cake and there are drastic cutbacks in that area.

The Minister for Finance will be here tomorrow afternoon and the Senator could ask him that question. Senator Norris asked about the craft which ply in EU waters, as did Senator MacSharry. I am very appreciative of Senator Minihan who sent me a note stating that under European law the double hull vessels will have to be in place by 2015.

While 2015 is a long way off I wanted to give the Senator the exact position. We will have to see if that can be advanced in any way and, perhaps, that is a matter for the Minister when he goes to the ministerial Council meetings.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Senator McDowell spoke about the freezing of developmental aid. I suggest he raise that matter tomorrow on the Estimates debate with the Minister for Finance. Senator MacSharry referred to the types of vessels which are still allowed in our waters and the protection of our waters. I do not think anything can protect against what happened in Galicia. It is catastrophe. As I said to Senator Norris, we will have to ask the relevant Minister to explain the timetable and if it can be advanced.Senator Finucane raised the matter of Senator Mary White who is travelling to Colombia and wished to complain about it. Senator Ó Murchú referred to the imperfect justice system in Columbia. Senator Mansergh also spoke on that issue. Senator White is travelling to Columbia in a personal capacity. There has been a long-standing tradition in both Houses, whatever the alleged misdemeanours or crimes, to see justice carried out. It is in that tradition that Senator White is going to Columbia. Senators Ó Murchú and Mansergh made strong utterances in that regard.Senator Coghlan raised the abolition of the first time buyer's grant. I am sure he will contribute to the debate on this issue later.

Senator Terry raised the issue of flooding in west Dublin. That matter has been tabled for discussion on the Adjournment by another Senator. I understand that only the Senator who tabled the matter can speak on it.Senator Terry, echoed by Senator O'Meara, also raised the urgent need to deal with the issue of barring orders. This is an extremely urgent matter and I will contact the offices of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ascertain what immediate plans are in place to rectify it. This matter has been brought to my attention also.Senator O'Meara asked about proposed legislation from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. While the Minister said he will introduce legislation regarding the Garda Complaints Board in the middle of next year we may not see it until nearer the end of the year.Senator O'Meara also asked what agency is responsible for monitoring or regulating surrogate parenthood. There is no such agency here. I am aware that many people are travelling to the UK in that regard. I will bring the issue to the attention of the relevant Minister.Senator Ulick Burke also referred to Senator Mansergh who has drawn great attention to himself today – Senator Norris inadvertently called him Tom Mansergh—

There is no provision whereby the chairperson would perform the functions of the chief executive and, therefore, the amendment proposed is not required.On a point of clarification, pending the establishment of the agency the functions of the chairperson and the chief executive have already been separated. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment. The former chairman, Mr. Paddy Teahon, acted as chief executive and the understanding was that the two functions would be separated in this Bill. That is the rationale behind the section. The proposal that a member of staff would perform the functions of the chief executive is preferable to the chairperson standing in. This is to keep the governance of the executive and board at arm's length. That is how we should proceed.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I thank the Minister and understand the point he makes. I made my point because of what had happened in the past. I wanted to make sure a standard had not been set and to establish that, with State companies, a chairperson who is also chief executive would not be appointed, as has previously happened. That is a standard that should be avoided and I accept the Minister has achieved that on this occasion. I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 13, subsection (3), line 6, to delete "6" and substitute "5".This is a follow-up to my earlier amendments about the size of the board. With a board of 12, which is my preferred number, a quorum of six is too large. Five is an adequate number for a board of 14. It is often the case that, the larger the membership, the more difficult it is to assemble a quorum. We have discovered that in these Houses on occasion. If we are to change the size of the board, we should consider changing the size of the quorum. Even if the size of the board is not changed, a quorum of five is sufficient.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The quorum proposed is roughly one third of the membership and I and my officials consider it the best arrangement that could be arrived at. It is not a lot to ask that at least one third of the membership be available.On amendment No. 21 relating to tele-conferencing, the existing provision does not preclude the holding of a meeting by such means providing all statutory conditions relating to the holding of meetings are satisfied. I acknowledge the spirit in which the Senator tabled the amendment, especially given that some members of the agency are resident or operate outside the State. This use of technology should be encouraged to save expense, but it is not necessary to provide specifically for tele-conferencing in the Bill.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I understand the Minister's point and will not press the amendment.On the tele-conferencing issue, the amendment states:(7) For the avoidance of doubt, any meeting of the Agency which is held in whole or in part by means of tele-conferencing shall be a valid meeting.As will be gathered from the inclusion of the phrase, "For the avoidance of doubt", I do not suggest and the Minister is correct to say that the amendment is necessary to validate meetings which are held using tele-conferencing. I have used it once or twice for meetings and I understand the best legal advice considers that it is not an issue.I tabled the amendment because its inclusion gives a suitable digital flavour to the Bill. It shows that we expect the board to make full use of the technology available to it. I will not go to the stake on this, but it would be a nice touch to add it to the Bill. I understand the Minister's point and happily withdraw the amendment on the basis of having made the point.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are cognate and may be discussed together by agreement.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I move amendment No. 22:
In page 15, subsection (1)(b), line 29, after “Oireachtas” to insert “or of a local authority”.My amendment will probably shock some of my colleagues in the House. Our usual practice when faced with sections such as this in legislation establishing State companies is to argue against the ban on Oireachtas Members being members of the board. On this occasion, I propose for a number of reasons to extend the ban to include local authority members. I fail to see the rationale for distinguishing between politicians at national or EU level and a local representative. A better argument could be made for excluding the local politician as he or she is more likely to be affected by local aspects of something going through. We should remember that the most blatant examples of corruption unveiled in recent times were at local rather than national level. We should consider this in regard to future State boards. It has particular relevance to this Bill.This is a project of national importance which will take place in a local framework in one particular area of the city. This is reflected in the requirement for the board of the agency to include the Dublin city manager, or his or her representative. That is surely all the more reason, especially because of the property implications of the agency's remit, that we formally exclude from membership any elected member of the local authority. I imagine there will be an outcry from local authority members at this suggestion. In this case, taking into account the debate we had last week, it seems important that we exclude local authority members from the board.The Minister may say it is not his intention to do so, but I believe that is how it should be. Recent developments show that this would be a good amendment to any Bill setting up a State agency. In this case we have a double reason for including it. I urge the Minister to give it serious consideration.

I have a problem with the way we try to exclude publicly elected members from a number of bodies. They are democratically elected. I am concerned at the trend to cut them out from this, that and the other, specifically this area. During the debate on Second Stage we learned of the amount of dialogue that has taken place between the Department, the local authority and local communities. Senator Quinn's amendment would prohibit one of the elected representatives of those communities from being a member of this body. It is important that somebody who has a feel for the local community and was elected by it should have the opportunity to be included.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	97	When the Minister was clarifying the composition of the board, he mentioned a lot of international heavyweights. While I am not in favour of excluding local authority members, it is important to strike a balance. I recognise that to set up a body such as this we must have an international component. Therefore, there should be a limiting restriction on a local authority member. Let me give one example.As a Member of the Dáil, I supported the merger of the Shannon and Foynes harbour boards into the Shannon-Foynes Port Authority. The Minister said at the time that it would be a new dawn for the estuary and that there would be individuals with appropriate marine and business experience on the board. This is a classic example of how things can go wrong. On the board of 12 there are six local authority members, all Fianna Fáil, an imbalance which is crazy and wrong. I say this straight out. I made the same point in my own council chambers during the week to the annoyance of many of the Fianna Fáil members. If the Minister wanted to set up a board with credibility, it was important to recognise that there should be a huge business component. While I recognise the local authority's familiarity with the area, it is overboard to have local authority members comprise 50% of the board in order to accommodate the different counties that merged in the estuary. This classic example shows the total imbalance in regard to local authority representation. While I do not favour excluding local authority members, a balance should be struck.In this case, even if there is a local authority member on the board, common sense should prevail. It is such an innovative project that it is necessary to take individuals from the mainstream of business with international experience in order to give credibility to the board.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	98	This topic will always engender an interesting debate, particularly in the Seanad. I cannot put it much better than Senator Kenneally. Now that I am on the other side of the fence as a Minister setting up agencies such as this, I always ask my officials why are Deputies and Senators restricted from being on these boards. I accept there are boards which should not have as members Members of the Oireachtas. Equally there are boards which could be more successful with representation from the Oireachtas.I could rise to the bait of Senator Finucane in relation to the Foynes issue. After the last day of the last Government, during the interregnum, all the vacancies on any board in the gift of my Department were stuffed with people who were quite obviously from the political parties. I am not saying they are not entitled to membership. By and large, the people who were appointed were excellent. One such person has been resurrected into the political domain, not in Senator Finucane's party but in another party, following a recent leadership contest. He was obviously rewarded then and is now back in the fold.I do not accept this amendment because the model we are following is the same one used for the Dublin Docklands Development Act. At the time I remember looking at that debate about the whole development of the docklands from a distance. Members of the local community were pretty annoyed at what they felt was the lack of consultation, etc. I am not critical of what happened there. There was subsequently significant consultation at the instigation of many of the local representatives both from the Oireachtas and the local authority. We have learnt about the required consultation from what happened in the Dublin docklands.As I said on the previous occasion we discussed the Committee Stage of this Bill, there has been substantial consultation with the local community groups. Senator Quinn is right, this is a major national project and has ramifications for us in the future, but it is also a particular local initiative and the local authority members from that locality may need to be on sub-committees of the board, etc. I would not like to exclude them nor would I like to see a total imbalance on the board in relation to local authority members because that would cause a difficulty. I appreciate there is a tendency to keep political balance when local authorities are involved and that could also cause a problem. I would rather follow the precedent that exists in the Dublin Docklands Development Act and not exclude local representation. I believe that is a good model.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I understand the Minister's point and the difficulty he would have in accepting this amendment. I made my point earlier and it was supported to a great extent by Senator Finucane's concern over what had happened in the past. This is a national venture but it is based locally. We have had examples where local authorities have allegedly been influenced by something other than the best interests of the objective itself.As Senator Finucane said, I am concerned they will often be party political appointments made in order to balance the parties. The Minister also pointed out that if a person from one party is there then somebody else must be appointed. I tabled the amendment in an effort to avoid both difficulties. I will not press it, but this should be taken into account in the future.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I move amendment No. 24:
In page 16, subsection (1), line 14, after "Minister" to insert "and in any case within 3 months of the establishment day,".This is another example of my wanting to speed up the process. This is not a green field project; it has been in gestation for some time. Much work has been done – for which I congratulate the Minister – but three months seems more than adequate to draw up a code of conduct. The Minister might be willing to accept this amendment because it does not seem that any longer period would be necessary.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I understand Senator Quinn's point and I try to cut delays and red tape in my Department whenever possible but my officials strongly suggest that while work has been done to date, there is no staff for the actual running of the agency. We envisage that more people will have to be involved. In that context, it would be better to consult with the staff interests, the unions and other representatives and my officials say that a timeframe of three months would be a bit tight. They would like to do it as quickly as possible but if it were written into the legislation, it would hamstring them. I suggest that the Senator withdraw the amendment but I assure him that we will endeavour to bring this forward as quickly as possible.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are related and may be taken together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 17, paragraph (e), line 28, to delete "(in excess of €650)".I suggest that we delete the words because it seems totally inappropriate to have an exemption limit for money gifts as there is no limit specified for other types of gifts. I regard the acceptance of money as a gift, at any level, in a business situation as being prima facie questionable. The notion that we should treat money gifts of €500 or €600 as beneath our notice is incredible. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. I have been happy to withdraw other amendments because the Minister has clearly listened and understood the case and has explained why he wished to maintain the Bill unchanged. I can understand visitors presenting gifts of a meal, a token or a souvenir but a money gift is unacceptable and it is incredible that we would say it is allowable to accept €500.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I apologise to the Minister for my late arrival. The reason is mundane – the train from Cork was an hour late for the first time in about five years. I am sure the Minister did not miss me and no discourtesy was intended in any case.I agree with Senator Quinn. However, a number of issues need to be addressed, the first of which is the one he has raised. The second is the value of the proprietary interest in any business. Given the nature of the dot com business, the value of a company can shoot up and down quite rapidly. I am concerned that €20,000 is a fairly substantial interest below which no declaration is needed. I suggest that even a shelf company which could become a beneficiary is a sufficiently serious matter to require a declaration of interest. I will return to other issues later on the section.In my view, to require a declaration of interest only where a member of the company has an interest to the value of €20,000 or more is exceedingly generous. If people are getting involved in something of this nature, the spirit of the legislation should be that they stay away from any businesses which would benefit from its activities. The letter of the law might be more difficult but it should state that the value of their involvement must be close to nominal. Currently there is a debate as to whether €4,000 is a nominal or significant sum of money but I am quite satisfied that €20,000 is a very significant sum of money. Indeed, I regard €1,000 as a significant sum and I am not happy that €20,000 should be the limit below which an interest need not be declared.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I have some sympathy with Senator Quinn's comments on amendment No. 27 and perhaps there is some confusion due to the wording of the text. I always understood that, in the case of somebody going abroad, gifts of holidays, transport, etc. in excess of £500, as it was, or €650 now, would have to be declared. I was not aware that one could accept a gift up to that amount in cash and I am not sure if that is what is intended now. Perhaps the matter can be looked at again in the context of other legislation.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I fully support the sentiments already expressed, particularly in relation to an interest to the value of €20,000 or more. I consider that figure totally excessive.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The monetary limits specified in the Bill in relation to gifts and the monetary limits for ownership are the same as the limits in section 28 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001. I am convinced by some of the arguments made by Senators and I will look at it between now and Report Stage. If memory serves me correctly, the limit in relation to gifts in excess of €650 is analogous to the ethics in public office legislation and I am not sure if money was included in that. However, I fully agree with Senator Quinn that, regardless of the amount, money should not be accepted in any shape or form and that has always been my view in political life.In relation to ownership of a proprietary interest in any business, I agree with Senator Ryan. A business related to the functions of the agency could have a book value well below €20,000 and still give the impression of being merely a shelf company but still have a huge turnover. I am concerned that the €20,000 limit is rather high and I will look at it again, though I cannot say I will come down to €1,000.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I thank the Minister for his comments and I am happy to withdraw the amendment pending the outcome of his further consideration. I share Senator Kenneally's concern in relation to the wording of the Bill on this point. It refers to "gifts of travel, holidays, transport, money (in excess of €650) or other benefits.". As I interpret it, the €650 applies only to money and I feel sure that is not the intention. The drafting should certainly be reviewed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	109	On reading it again, I believe the Senator is correct. The "other benefits" should also be included under "in excess of €650". I will look at it again.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	110	With regard to the provision that "the agency shall publish continuously by electronic means", I wish to touch on the point I made on amendment No. 6 about the difference between "compelling" and "enabling". Although the Minister has agreed to consider this matter further before Report Stage, I am concerned that I may not have made the case strongly enough. I am not seeking an amendment which simply states that publication by electronic means will be enabled. It is essential that publication by electronic means actually takes place. I hope the Minister will take full account of that in considering the matter further.While I have advocated publication by electronic means in the context of other Bills, it is particularly essential in this Bill. The publication of gifts is one example. If published, but not by electronic means, it could mean that a gift accepted in January would not be published until six months after the end of the year in the annual accounts, or 18 months after the event. The use of electronic means would facilitate immediate publication. Rather than simply enabling publication in that form, it should be an obligatory requirement so that it is readily accessible on the Internet
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I note the Senator's comments but we will have to wait and see what we come up with on Report Stage. However, as the Senator as a businessman will appreciate, I do not wish to over-regulate a body by insisting on electronic publication of every document. It could tie up people in difficulties which we might not envisage now if we were to be unduly prescriptive in the Bill. I will bear the Senator's comments in mind but I am concerned to avoid excessive regulation of business and general activity.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I appreciate the Minister's response on the last two amendments. Is he satisfied that directors of an agency such as this should be allowed to accept gifts of travel or holidays etc.? It is not very seemly, even if it is legally correct, for people to be brought on trips or holidays by companies connected with the business related to the functions of the agency. The proper ethos of an agency like this would indicate that the director and other employees should simply refuse. A declaration of interest is an acceptable middle road, but it is not seemly for directors to go on trips sponsored by commercial interests. I ask the Minister whether they should be discouraged.

I will look at it again on Report Stage. In a body like this, where there are fairly major commercial interests, not only is it unseemly but if I were a director I would not accept or become involved. I will look at it again but, in all fairness, this is the standard which has been accepted in previous legislation. However, in the climate of absolute political correctness we cannot accept any gift. This is probably a good thing, not only for politicians but also for agencies. To a certain extent it might be a help not to include it for them as it can be taken to extremes. If someone on a delegation is given across the table a pen with the company's name on it, that would be a gift under the legislation and would have to be declared.There must be a middle course, although I take the Senator's point with regard to travel, holiday and transport. However, if there was a plane going which was owned by some business person, such as Senator Quinn – I do not know if he owns a plane – and a lift was offered to save someone having to go through the airport, that would be prohibited, which is somewhat unfair. We have to steer a middle course.

It is so much cheaper, easier and more efficient. It takes no time at all. My children use this form of communication so much more easily than writing letters. The Minister said he does not want restrict it too much but I would like the Minister to look at electronic publication. I look forward to his reply. I would love to see it compelled rather than enabled in some cases and section 24 is one of these.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I ask the Minister about subsection (4), which provides that where the Minister is satisfied that a member of the agency has failed to comply with subsection (1), the declaration of interest and the disclosure of a possible conflict of interest by a member, he may remove that member from office or take such other action as he considers appropriate. Why is there discretion? If a member of an agency such as this deliberately fails to make a disclosure the penalty should be dismissal at least.I accept that there may be occasional genuine errors where people with complicated interlocking businesses may not know of an interest if something comes up at short notice. Nevertheless, where the Minister is satisfied that someone knew of an interest and did not disclose it there should be no discretion. The person should be removed from the agency. I would like the Minister's views.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The Senator has answered his own point. There would need to be discretion if the indiscretion was minor. It is a case of not being over-prescriptive in legislation. There could be a very unfair situation where someone, inadvertently or due to infirmity, may have omitted to make a declaration. The Minister would act on the recommendation of officials with regard to the seriousness of the incident. There is legal precedent for this in other legislation. There should be discretion where the penalties are punitive and could be publicly punitive for what might have been a minor indiscretion.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Why does the Minister think that there is no need for a definition of an interest, similar to that in section 24, which refers to the interests of a member of the staff? I know it is somewhat different but the definition of "interest" in section 24 applies only to that section. Why does a similar definition not apply here? Perhaps it is an oversight which can be remedied on Report Stage.

He is saying the word "interest" has not been defined in section 26 although it is defined in section 24. People are conscious that it might apply more to board members than members of staff. I am not sure if that is the case. It can be examined on Report Stage. The definition of interest in section 24 may not be exhaustive but it is being used as a precedent.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We can look at it. We can never proscribe downright evil. If people want to find a way around something they will find it.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I have no desire to be confrontational. The difference I see is that the existing clause prohibits the disclosure of information deemed by the agency to be confidential, whereas this amendment covers information deemed either by the agency or the Minister to be confidential. I am happy that the Minister is reluctant to be too prescriptive, but it seems extraordinarily prescriptive not to allow the agency to decide what is or is not confidential, which will be the effect of the amendment. One could believe the amendment has been introduced to benefit a Minister who wishes to interfere politically and not have the matter covered by disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, although I do not suggest that this is true of the Minister. My reading of the amendment may be incorrect, but it appears that the essence of the change is to include the Minister in the list of those who can determine what is to be seen as confidential information.

The Minister has been included because there may be circumstances in which information about leaks comes to the attention of the Minister, not the agency. I can vouch for the fact that this happens: when I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I became aware that a member of staff was leaking confidential information to the public. If the Minister was aware of the fact that information had been divulged, but the provision I propose was not specifically mentioned in the Bill, he or she would be unable to intervene. It is important that we make this provision.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	127	The Senator can speak on the section when we have dealt with amendment No. 30.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Chair will have to bear with me before he decides whether I am misbehaving, as the point I wish to make relates to both the amendment and the section. Section 27 states, "a person shall not, without the consent of the Agency, disclose confidential information." As only the agency can decide what may be disclosed, it is surely illogical to allow the agency and the Minister to determine the definition of confidential information. If the Minister declares that something is confidential, the agency may still decide to disclose it if it wishes. In such an instance, the idea of the Minister acting as a kind of second protection is meaningless. The amendment is unnecessary if the agency and the Minister are not both mentioned in section 27(1).
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I understand the point being made by the Senator. If confidential information was to be made available with the consent of the agency, the consent of the Minister would also have to be acquired. The Minister's opinion, according to the amendment, will be sought in relation to "information that is expressed by the Agency or the Minister to be confidential," but his consent is not needed. I put it to the Senator that opinion and consent are two different matters. The Minister may be involved in making a report to the agency and the agency may decide that while the information is confidential, it does not mind that it is divulged. It is possible to parse and analyse this amendment to too great an extent. The intention of the section is to ensure confidential information from the agency is not leaked in a way that is detrimental to the interests of the agency. Obviously, the Minister will have an input in deciding whether leaked confidential information is commercially sensitive or important in a similar manner. The Minister has to be involved in the decision. In a way, the Senator is asking me to be more prescriptive.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	132	My understanding of company law suggests that it is extraordinary to allow a company's shareholders, as distinct from its directors, to have so much influence. The agency, which in this instance can be compared to the directors, is supposed to function commercially. I repeat that I think this is an unnecessary amendment. It is a product of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, which tends to try to encompass everything. I do not intend to call a vote on this matter, but suggest that the Minister should re-examine it before Report Stage. I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary. I do not think that the Minister thinks it is necessary either, but that is a separate issue.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The parameters of confidential information and to whom the provisions of this section should apply are clearly defined in the Bill. There have been many cases of leaking information. As this is new legislation and the parameters are defined, I wonder if it would be worthwhile notifying the officials of all State bodies about their responsibilities vis-à-vis confidential information. State boards which have worker directors encounter difficulties when decisions are taken about what can or cannot be divulged, as such decisions have long-term implications for members of the board. I notice that the section provides for a fine of €2,000 for those found to have leaked confidential information. Has anybody paid a fine for leaking confidential information? I doubt it very much.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I do not know if an official from an agency has been fined, but I am aware, as I mentioned, of a case in the former Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs where someone was dismissed for leaking confidential information. In the case in question, an official lost his job immediately when found to have leaked information about a specific person to a detective agency. There have been instances of severe punishment.I imagine that this type of provision is to be found in most modern legislation dealing with State agencies. When a group meets, whether it is at a Cabinet meeting or a meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, one cannot legislate for human nature; if a person feels the need to leak information, he or she will do so. While we can do what we like in legislation, human nature is human nature. The section is not intended to place a heavy hand on the organisation. In some instances, people believe that no harm is done when certain information is leaked, but the main target of the section is information that, if leaked, would have a detrimental effect on the organisation in question.

The provision allows the agency to borrow a maximum of €10 million and requires that any such borrowings be subject to the prior approval of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Finance. The provision was not included in the Bill at the time of publication as discussions on the conditions and text of the provisions had yet to be finalised by the Minister for Finance. These discussions have now been concluded and the provision has been approved by the Minister for Finance.While the refurbishment of the property and the hub will be undertaken by PPP, it may be more appropriate for the agency to undertake purchase of refurbishment of property in certain circumstances. This is why the borrowing provision allows the agency to borrow up to €10 million.

In page 21, subsection (4), line 29, to delete "as soon as practicable but not later than 3 months" and substitute "not later than 1 month".I have tabled a few amendments about time. However, the timescale here is far too leisurely. We are not talking here about the publication of annual accounts or the publication of audited accounts, we are talking about the submission of accounts for audit. There is absolutely no reason such accounts should not be ready within one month of the end of the financial year. All well run businesses keep accounts on a monthly basis at least. Just one month's account would, therefore, remain to be closed at the end of the year. Speed in reporting is an essential dimension of accountability. We are asking here that they be sent for audit within one month. We are not talking about publication. I know the Minister had some difficulty in the past about the speedy publication of accounts as I would see it. However, accounts should be sent for audit within one month rather than the leisurely three months suggested here.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	138	This is the standard used in previous legislation. I do not propose to accept the amendment. I understand the Senator's desire for speed and concur with the spirit of his view. However, being over-prescriptive would be a little dangerous in these instances.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I did not expect the Minister to accept the amendment. It is interesting to see each year how the banks vie with one another to publish their accounts within 24 or 48 hours of the end of the financial year. They must have good bookkeeping systems to be able to do so. The accounts may not be audited at that stage but they publish them. We should be urging far more speed in regard to all accounts rather than the leisurely approach which has existed in the past. I accept what the Minister said that this has been the tradition in the past. The fact that we are only asking that the agency send the accounts for audit within a month should be accepted. However, I will not press the amendment but perhaps I will come back to the point at another stage.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I do not agree with Senator Quinn on this issue. As someone who worked as an accountant with a public limited company before becoming a Member of the Oireachtas, I do not think his proposal is practical. Financial accounts are produced on a monthly basis but producing the overall package at the end of the year is an extremely difficult process. In any organisation one is, first, working to deadlines internally and, second, producing for outside. Perhaps Superquinn can do it, but I believe that one month after the financial year has ended is not practical to get accounts ready for audit. I do not think that even three months is generous but at least there is a stipulation in relation to three months. Some companies, semi-State bodies and so on have been very lax in the past, therefore the three months stipulation is quite adequate.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I move amendment No. 35:
In page 21, lines 49 to 52, to delete subsection (2).This is a meaty proposal with which we have had experience in the past. I propose to delete this subsection. The proposal was made in the House and accepted by Ministers in the past, therefore I was amazed to see it turn up again. The last time there was something like this we tabled an amendment. Having had a long debate on the issue, the Minister accepted the amendment.I utterly and completely oppose the section. It is totally against the spirit of the age to put such a legislative gag on anyone. Has the Minister any idea how appalling this section appears? It smacks more of Russia under Stalin than the 21st century Ireland we are asking people to believe in. The inclusion of this subsection is a complete travesty from a Government which is always trumpeting its regard for openness, accessibility and transparency. The Minister may well say this has appeared somewhere else. It certainly appeared in a Bill last year and the feeling in this House was so strong that the Minister was happy to withdraw the proposal. Clauses such as this have been thrown out of proposed legislation in the past and I hope we do so again today. I urge the Minister to say in this instance that he did not realise the proposal was included, it slipped in without his noticing it and that he will remove it right away.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I support Senator Quinn's amendment. It was remiss of me. I would have tabled an amendment but by the time I found this subsection, I hoped we were moving on from it.This would mean that the Governor of the Central Bank appearing before the appropriate Oireachtas committee could not criticise public policy. There are two issues here. First, are we saying chief executives should not be able to criticise public policy before a committee but that they can do so anywhere else. This trivialises the Oireachtas because it means the chief executive will go elsewhere and criticise public policy as he or she sees fit. Chief executives of agencies should be in a position to criticise public policy, otherwise they are mere ciphers. They might as well be part of the Civil Service if they do not have the autonomy to think for themselves and express themselves. One assumes that chief executives have a reasonable maturity and will not get involved in unnecessary confrontation.  However, the idea that a chief executive should not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister is wrong.An obvious case that would arise is the Combat Poverty Agency. If this were the true philosophy, the chief executive of the Combat Poverty Agency would be precluded from criticising public policy on poverty, which in my opinion would be wrong. The alternative is to say they can do so but they cannot do so before the Committee of Public Accounts, in which case it becomes even more meaningless. The confusion is added to in section 32 which refers to all other Oireachtas committees. Apparently there is no such prohibition if the chief executive appears before another Oireachtas committee – he or she can say what he or she likes. The prohibition simply refers to the Committee of Public Accounts.As I said earlier, I believe this is another one of these phrases to which the Parliamentary Counsel has taken a shine and which is now inserted into legislation connected with the Committee of Public Accounts. One could see this –I do not say this about the current Minister – as a response to the vigorous role the Committee of Public Accounts played with various Government agencies in making life difficult for them and asking difficult questions. One could see it as an attempt to clip the wings of the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not believe that is the Minister's intention but it would be the result of the proposal.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	143	As a former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, when discussing various matters we were always reminded that we could not be critical of policy or of Ministers. Sometimes we had to bite our lip in order to stay within the parameters. I compliment Senator Quinn on this amendment. On day one, we were told the digital hub would be a very exciting, innovative body and we were told about its international component. If we are to forge an independence for it, as any body such as this requires, it would be regrettable to muzzle the chief executive so that he cannot express his thoughts where he may disagree with policy. I fully agree that this measure should be deleted from the Bill.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	144	In this legislation, the Digital hub is being given a commercial mandate. There is no policy involved; it is a commercial operation. More generally – this is where we differ – I believe that a chief executive should not comment on Government policy before Oireachtas committees. One may point out that he can do so at other committees or outside the committee, but we all know Oireachtas committees are political maelstroms. Of course the Opposition would use the opportunity to get at the chief executive, who should be independently appointed. It would put the chief executive in the embarrassing position of having to make comments on political matters and Government policy. That is unfair.I caution the Senators that while it all sounds nice and open and in the spirit of transparency, in reality, if the independently appointed chief executive of any body comes before an Oireachtas committee, the Senators know as well as I that he or she will be used as a political instrument to get at the Government. The chief executive would be put in the invidious position of having to comment on Government policy whether he or she liked it. This measure is important as protection.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	145	The Minister has it totally back to front. He says that this measure will protect the chief executive from having to comment. Then he says almost the very opposite – that it will force the chief executive not to criticise Government policy where he believes it is essential. The Minister has twisted things, perhaps unintentionally. It is the section that is invidious not the position of the chief executive. It is bad law and should not go through. We mentioned this in the House before and the Minister accepted the point. Measures such as this have slipped in before and were noticed and removed. I urge the Minister to reconsider.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	146	It appears that the director of the Combat Poverty Agency should not comment on poverty, the director of FÁS should not comment on cutbacks in its budget, the director of a State funded research agency should not comment on cutbacks in research funding and the directors of institutes of technology, who are chief executives of essentially State bodies, should not criticise public policy. The extension of this logic is Stalinism. There is no other word to describe it. It is an undemocratic centralism and, incidentally, a philosophy which has characterised this State since its foundation – an authoritarian, hierarchical view of how society should be organised. This is relevant no matter which Government is in power.What this country needs more than anything else is serious, intelligent debate about its problems. If every agency set up by the State is to be a mouthpiece for Government policy, precluded from criticising it, where does that leave, for example, the Central Bank? Will it be an exception or will there be an amendment in the next Bill saying that the Governor of the Central Bank should not criticise policy? It is traditional in our society that the Central Bank draws our attention to issues of public policy. The Minister is completely wrong on this and his suggestion is offensive to chief executives.Incidentally, it is clear that the Minister has been in Government for the last number of years because today's Oireachtas committees are remarkably non-confrontational most of the time. They work very well by consensus, except when legislation is being dealt with – but if legislation is being dealt with there will be no chief executive officer of a State agency before the committee. The Minister should read the transcripts, for example, of the grilling received by the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology about its accounts. I mention this because I read it by accident. There was no sign of Government-Opposition division: some of the harshest criticism came from Opposition Members. The way committees function has nothing to do with Government and Opposition. If the Minister thinks they operate on this basis it is a reflection of the fact that he has not been a member of one for quite a while. They operate by consensus, with a small number of people from different backgrounds agreeing about issues worth pursuing. If issues of public policy come up, they do so in a quite unpartisan way.I saw this when I was on the Joint Committee on European Affairs for a considerable number of years. All that time, there was rarely a question of Government-Opposition confrontation no matter who was being dealt with. It was a question of working through the problem and finding consensus. When the former Leader of Fine Gael wrote a report on the future of Europe, the ensuing debate was not on a party political basis. The Minister is wrong in his understanding of how committees work. He is wrong about the role of chief executives of State agencies and he is wrong about the need to protect them. To stifle their independence would be to destroy the appeal of the role. This measure, if carried through, will reduce dramatically the quality of the people who go into these jobs because they will not do so to be ciphers for Government.

If certain policies are inhibiting the profitability of a commercial operation, the chief executive should be allowed to point out the constraints under which he is operating. Not to allow him this latitude would be most remiss.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I do not accept what the Senators have said and I reiterate my view. Representatives of the Combat Poverty Agency and other bodies do make comments publicly, regardless of the legislation, which does not prevent them from doing so. It will be the same with this. I have been in the Oireachtas for nearly 16 years so I have a good idea of how the committees operate. This provision should act as a protection to the independence of a chief executive in that he should not be obliged to make comments on political matters. Senator Ryan referred to the examination of the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology. That was in relation to the accounts, not Government policy, which is what this legislation deals with.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I was not saying that.

It may not always happen, but perhaps once in a year a big political issue may be connected with a certain agency so that the chief executive is obliged to answer political questions, which are best left to the politicians. This is not correct.

I will not press it on this occasion because I want the Minister to think it over and discuss it with his colleagues. The advice he will get is that this is over the top. Senator Ryan has given solid reasons it should not apply in other State agencies and the serious position that would arise if we had similar sections in other Bills.The Minister has time to think about this issue before Report Stage and, therefore, I will not press the amendment because we will have a vigorous debate on the topic on Report Stage. The Minister, if he lies awake at night wondering if he should do this, tossing and turning, will come back and tell us that it is a good idea and the section will be deleted.

In page 22, subsection (1), line 41, to delete "30 June" and substitute "31 March".We should be grateful for small mercies. When I came into this House ten years ago, Ministers fought tooth and nail against the notion that any time limit should be placed on the preparation of a State body's report. I remember looking for the previous year's RTÉ report on 1 December and discovering it had not yet been published. RTÉ had finished the report some time before and had sent it, but it had not been published. I am glad to say that over the ten years I have worn opposition to publication down to the extent that the time limit is now firmly embedded in the word processors of the parliamentary counsel and it tends to turn up in every Bill.The timescale, however, is wrong. Six months is an age in the life of a company. We discussed the length of time it takes to get accounts. At six months, we risk the annual report becoming almost an historical document instead of a useful tool for management and accountability. If vast companies in the private sector can publish their annual reports within days – certainly within three months – so can we, especially a digital hub development agency, the very ones who should be at the forefront. We cannot have a 21st century company operating to 19th century timescales.Often a State body submits its report to the sponsoring Department, which then sits on it for months without publishing it. I experienced this in a State body in which I was involved. We were trying to set a standard of publishing the report before the end of March and were able to give it to the Minister only to discover he had no intention of looking at it for months. As a result, we had to push to get it published before the end of April.Time is of the essence in accountability and management. These reports should be published as soon as possible. Certainly, they should be published as soon as they are ready. It should never happen that a finished report gathers dust on a civil servant's or Minister's desk. I have experience of this and know it has happened. The example I mentioned of RTÉ ten years ago was an instance where RTÉ had given the report to the Minister of the day and it sat there on his desk. As soon as we asked for it, it was published, but not until December. I urge a sense of speed on this matter.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I support Senator Quinn. He was chairman of An Post and succeeded in getting what would not be regarded as the most dynamic of State companies to produce its accounts within three months. Any suggestions that this is not practical for the most dynamic and forward looking of our State agencies should not be taken too seriously.This is a good time to mention that the public and the Minister for Finance have focused on value for money and efficiency in the public sector. Truthfully, tight deadlines are one of the most magnificent incentives to efficiency. The idea that because it might take six months under limited circumstances, that length of time is needed, is incorrect. If people are given legally obligatory deadlines, things will be done. If they are not, they will be done within the six month period unless there is an exceptional situation like that where Senator Quinn was in charge where things were done with a sense of urgency because of his commitment. Setting a six month deadline means reports will take six months while setting a three month deadline means they will be done in three months. That is reasonable and the sort of thing we need if we are turn our public services into the models of efficiency they ought to be.

Having had experience in recent years with Government agencies, there must be some flexibility on the time period and six months is reasonable. There is an effort on behalf of Government to get reports as quickly as possible. On amendment No. 37, I accept its spirit and will return to it on Report Stage.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Amendment No. 40 is consequential on amendment No. 39 and they will be discussed together.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I move amendment No. 39:
In page 23, line 12, before "The Agency" to insert "(1)".The purpose of this amendment is to stamp out once and for all a practice that is definitely not in the public interest. When we set up a State body of any kind, the task we have set it is one which would be better done outside the framework of central government. We create State agencies to do specific jobs and in legislating for them we give them all the powers they need to do the job within the broader framework of the public service. We do not create a State body in order that it will delegate the doing of the job to someone else. The only people a State body can properly delegate to are its own staff.That is not to say State bodies should not employ consultants on occasion. The consultant is a much maligned beast and I can understand the reason sometimes. There are exceptions, however, and times when their expert advice and input are needed. That is not the same as employing consultants to do the job one should do oneself.I raise this issue because it happened recently, not once but twice. In one of those instances it had to do with the interim company that the Bill before the House will dissolve. It is not a theoretical issue but a practical and an immediate one. As legislators, we need to lay down a marker. My main objection is that it is a bad principle to delegate to an outside body and contractor the key function for which the agency was set up.There is also a more down to earth objection. Employing somebody else to do something is an horrendously expensive way of getting things done. Consultants charge for their time at levels that can range up to a multliple of what it would cost otherwise, sometimes several thousand euro a day. When one employs them to carry out an executive function and pay them their daily rate, day in and day out, one soon runs into astronomical figures, amounts one would not dream of paying them if they were employed as individuals on one's staff. There is logic and economic sense in this also. It is small wonder that such arrangements are widely regarded by the public as gravy trains which are designed for the benefit of a small clique of insiders because it appears the same names crop up over and over again.Exactly the same consideration applies to lawyers working for the State tribunals. I saw some figures in recent days that horrified me. Instead of paying them at a daily rate they should be offered staff positions at a set salary. However, that is outside the scope of this legislation. The two cases have a great deal in common. What I am urging is that the Minister consider this in the way proposed. There may be a different way of doing it, but the way I propose is worthy of consideration.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I support the amendment because I recall at the Committee of Public Accounts there was concern in regard to the number of consultants employed. Often there was resentment within the Civil Service in regard to consultants being deployed from outside as it was considered that there was the necessary expertise to carry out whatever consultancy was required. In the financially straitened circumstances about which the Government and the pundits continue to remind us, the whole area of the appointment of consultants should be looked at. It should be the last decision of any chief executive of any organisation to deploy consultants. Certainly, there has been excessive use of consultants in recent years.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I fully support the point made by my two colleagues. The commitment of a chief executive officer, as distinct from the knowledge of a consultant, is quite different. A consultant is not single-mindedly committed to the advancement of the agency or organisation but there to give advice. The wonderful thing about being a consultant is that, subject to certain laws about negligence, he or she is not responsible for the consequences of his or her advice because ultimately he or she does not take the decisions. A chief executive, subject to proper agency supervision, takes them. Therefore, to put a consultant in that position is to invite temper-rising and diffusion of responsibility, which is not a good idea. I fully agree with Senator Quinn's amendment which I support enthusiastically. I wish to raise other issues about the section to which I will return in due course.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	167	While I appreciate Senators and Deputies on all sides in both Houses have strong views on the hiring of consultants, advisers and so on, I ask Senators not to let those views cloud what is being done in this Bill. The digital hub is a detailed enterprise. There was agreement on an earlier section that the chief executive and the chairman of the board would be at arm's length. In that instance we suggested a member of staff would replace the chief executive should there be a vacancy in the chief executive's position. However, that member of staff may not have the required skills to run the company. In that case the agency, with the consent of the Minister, should be allowed to appoint consultants.The amendment, while well meaning, would restrict the agency in what it could or could not do. In the event that there is a vacancy or because of the non-availability of the chief executive the member of staff replacing him or her in the interim period may have grave difficulty in running the company. I cannot accept the amendment as it would cause a difficulty in regard to what we are trying to do in the other section.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	168	The Minister has made a case that I understand and I can see there are exceptions. My amendment had the effect of drawing to his attention the concerns about appointing consultants to do the work which has happened on occasion. I accept it is probably too broad and that the Minister's explanation is correct. I urge him to take it into account with a view to finding a better way to solve the problem.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	169	There are consultants and advisers involved in all scales of activity. Somebody may be given a short contract at a cost of no more than €1,000, while somebody else may be involved in a major task at a cost of €100,000. Is there not a need for a code of conduct or similar procedure in regard to the process by which consultants are appointed whereby a public competition should be the norm? Where a significant sum of money may be involved – I will not argue whether it should be €5,000 or €50,000 – a contract to consultants should not be capable of being offered without some element of advertising and public competition.I do not want to tie people in excessive knots, but if we are talking about significant sums of money being paid to particular individuals, then good sense dictates that the public understands that this is the consequence of proper public competition. I wonder about EU regulations if public money of the scale of, say, €100,000 is to be spent on a consultant. If this was to be done without transparency, I suspect we would run into problems with the European Union in terms of the rules about not confining competitions to nationals of one country. I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	170	There is a limit, if memory serves me correctly, of €150,000, above which it is subject to public procurement where one has to advertise in the EU Journal. For smaller amounts there would be a degree of discretion, but one would still have to advertise. In that respect there would be openness and one would be answerable to the agency in regard to lower amounts. That is the system in place and it works reasonably well.In this case particularly there will be a need to take on consultants. I visited MediaLab Europe to which Senators might go and see what is being done. It is an incredibly specialised area. From that point of view I have no doubt the digital hub would be exactly the same on the other side of the road. As a former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I am aware that there were a great many consultants and a great deal of change in regard to PPS numbers and the Grow and Reach projects. I used to be asked questions in the Dáil as to the reasons consultancy services were so massive. Since the expertise required did not exist within the public service consultants had to be brought in to devise the standard card, etc. There are occasions when this is necessary.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Far be it for me to argue with you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but we spent a great deal of time discussing an amendment.I do not have a problem with Departments engaging consultants and I am not pushed whether members of my party or others make political comments about them. I am concerned that consultants be people appointed on merit and that the public is satisfied they are so appointed. That involves transparency. There is a case for the Minister to at least put together a code of conduct for the agency whereby if a budget for particular consultants is to exceed, say, €50,000 such consultants should be appointed following a public competition. It does not have to take the pace of the Civil Service Commission. The agency can do this at its own pace but it should advertise, invite people in and be transparent in its evaluation of who gets the contract.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Is this usual in legislation setting up State agencies or is it new? I have not seen it written down before. I have seen a letter from the Department of Finance regarding a colleague in the Dáil who was indemnified by the State when suing in case the costs were awarded against him. Only one paragraph of the letter dealt with indemnification. Most of it warned the rest of us not to assume for one second that if we, in our capacity as members of Oireachtas committees, sued anybody the Department of Finance was going to pick up the bill. It is unusual that written into this legislation is a statement categorically assuring people that they would be indemnified against all claims. It may be typical but I have gone through over 20 years of legislation and have not come across it before.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Aviation (Regulations) Act, 2001, contains a similar provision. It is a standard provision which enables the agency to indemnify a person to whom this section applies against actions arising from bona fide performance of their duties.I am somewhat astounded – I have said this before – at the number and quality of people who put themselves forward for positions on this board. They are willing to put themselves into the public eye, something which they could do without. In many cases, they receive only a pittance for the work they undertake. The least we, as a State, can afford them is protection against their personal liability in any instances where they could be sued, provided they have been bona fide in the delivery of their duties. I recently set up an appeals process in my Department. The person to be paid for the work involved has specifically asked for a similar indemnification. I can understand why. People must be sure they will not be personally sued. Obviously the agency could be sued and would operate under an umbrella regarding any difficulties which it, because of its decisions, had made.It is only right and proper that the people involved in the agency, provided they have discharged their duties in a bona fide manner, be afforded this protection.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I do not wish to delay the House unduly. I do not disagree with this section. I merely said it is not something with which I am familiar. While I have problems with other sections of the Bill, I do not have any problems with this one. This principle should apply universally. I am aware of cases – I am sure the Minister is aware of them also – where trustees of community halls and associations have been held personally liable because they were not adequately insured or insured at all. These are individuals – precisely those identified by the Minister – who put themselves into the firing line for no great reward. We could usefully extend this indemnification to a wider area than a couple of State agencies.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Is this provision necessary? I am not keen on State agencies being in no way responsible if they do not perform their duties. Many other people do not get away with that generosity of spirit. The Bill provides that, regardless of what they do wrong, they cannot be sued by anybody. I find that rather difficult to accept.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I am informed that it is a standard provision.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I propose to take amendments Nos. 40a, 40b. and 40c together.This section deals with the transfer of assets to the agency, including the property purchase for the hub by Office of Public Works, which has remained vested in the Office of Public Works pending the enactment of this legislation. The amendments are proposed to bring greater clarity to the section.Amendment No. 40a is a minor drafting amendment which gives greater clarity to that paragraph. Amendment No. 40b is technical in nature and is being proposed on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 40c is also a drafting amendment which will avoid repetition of a provision already included in section 7.I would also like to signal to the House that there will be further amendment of this section on Report Stage. On the advice of the Attorney General's office, the amendment will clarify that properties to be transferred to the agency will not include those held by the Office of Public Works in respect of Media Lab Europe which are also located in the digital hub area.On foot of the amendments to this transitional provision, I would like to signal to the House my intention to propose certain minor amendments to the following sections on Report Stage: two minor amendments to section 3 will deal with allowing the boundaries of the Hub to be varied as well as extended by ministerial order so as to allow for any future eventuality in defining the area of the hub; a minor technical amendment to section 7(2)(b) spelling out, in greater detail, the ways in which the agency would manage its interests in property and a minor technical amendment to section 9(6) to correct a drafting error.I would also like to signal to the House that there will be further amendments to section 8 on Report Stage. These relate to the commercial nature of the agency and the carrying out by it of the PPP process to refurbish property for the hub.As I outlined in relation to the borrowing provision, it may be that, in some instances, the agency would take a more direct role in procuring land or property for the digital hub and in carrying out construction and maintenance works. The first amendment to section 8 is, therefore, intended to bring that into line with what is envisaged in the new borrowing section.While I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands will confer all the powers necessary for the agency, it has been decided to include further amendments to spell out in greater detail the powers the agency will have to partner the private sector in order to fulfil its commercial remit. Specifically, these will deal with the agency's powers to enter into agreements for the purposes of developing the hub.A further three amendments will be proposed to section 8. These will again spell out what is already implicit in the Bill regarding the agency's commercial remit. They will deal with the powers arising from its functions to exploit commercial opportunities to receive income and to make payments. This highlights that the agency, being a commercial body, will be obliged to obtain revenue from its activities.It is proposed to include these provisions to make the statutory underpinning for these aspects of the agency's functions as explicit as possible to take account of the perception of the project by the potential commercial partners. This will strengthen the PPP process and the standing of the agency in the eyes of the market. The amendments are in line with current legislative precedent, such as the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act, 2002, and the Transport Railway Infrastructure Act, 2001.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I am pleased to be able to introduce this short Bill in the Seanad and to commend it to the House. It is not complicated legislation but it is important because it is a further step towards enabling Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Nice and allowing the historic process of enlargement of the European Union to proceed as planned. I will explain the contents of the Bill and why they are necessary, and then say a few words about the wider background to the legislation.The decision to ratify the Treaty of Nice was taken by the people in an historic referendum on 19 October last. However, a few technical measures must legally be taken before the State can ratify the treaty. Passage of this legislation is one of those measures. A fundamental aspect of European Union law is that Community legislation has direct legal effect in each member state. This was recognised and allowed for in the original constitutional amendment enabling Ireland to join the European Economic Community, as it then was, in 1973. The European Communities Act, 1972, listed the treaties and other Acts which would have direct legal effect in the State, and allowed for further implementing regulations to be made by Ministers.As the original communities have grown and developed through successive treaties, it has been necessary in each case to amend the European Communities Act accordingly to take account of each of these new treaties. On each previous occasion, before Ireland has ratified an EU treaty, it has through legislation made relevant provisions of the treaty part of the domestic law of the State so that at the time of ratification, it is fully able to discharge its obligations. That is the purpose of the legislation.The Bill contains two sections and amends the 1972 Act. Section 1 is the principal operative part of the Bill. It adds the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Nice to the list of treaties and other instruments contained in the definition of the "treaties governing the European Communities" in Section 1(1) of the 1972 Act, as amended. These are Articles 1.15 and 2 to 10, together with annexed protocols. For ease of use, the 1972 Act, as amended, contains a table with a complete list of "treaties governing the European Communities". Section 1(2) of the Bill adds a reference to the Treaty of Nice to that table.Section 2 contains normal provisions concerning the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement. It provides that the Act will come into operation on such day as may be appointed by order made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That day will coincide with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice.It is worth outlining briefly the logic behind the selection of the Articles of the Treaty of Nice which, through the Bill, are to be made part of domestic law and to explain the basis on which the decisions were made. Article 1 of the Treaty of Nice amends aspects of the Treaty on European Union. Measures adopted under that treaty in the foreign policy and justice and home affairs areas differ from directives, regulations and decisions adopted under the Community treaties in the mainstream social and economic sectors. The major difference is that they do not have direct legal effect. The obligations created are essentially intergovernmental.For the most part the European Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction in these areas. Because of this the Bill does not include reference to Articles 1.1 to 1.14. Article 1.15, however, amends provisions relating to those limited areas under the Treaty on European Union in which the European Court of Justice does have a role. It is, therefore, necessary to include it in the list of provisions of the Treaty of Nice II which, through this Bill, are being made part of the domestic law of the State.In the area of justice and home affairs, some instruments, once adopted by the Council, require subsequent legislative implementation by member states. In preparing this legislation consideration was again given to whether provisions relating to JHA matters should be brought within the terms of the European Communities Act. Such an arrangement would allow for JHA legislation to be given domestic effect by regulation rather than by primary legislation. However, as was the case when the matter was last considered as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was felt that these matters were of sufficient weight and sensitivity to merit implementation through primary, rather than secondary, legislation. Therefore, they are not included in this Bill and remain outside the scope of the European Communities Act. As Members will recall that this specific process of using 1973 legislation, to bring into effect by secondary legislation Acts of the European communities, was debated and criticised, what we have done here is a positive move which should be welcomed.Articles 2 to 10 of the treaty, together with annexed protocols, represent the main body of the substantive amendments to the European Communities Treaties provided for in the Act. Article 2 amends various aspects of the treaty establishing the European Community. It is the most substantial of the Articles. Article 3 amends provisions of the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. Article 4 amends aspects of the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. Article 5 amends the protocol on the statute of the European system of Central Banks and the European Central Bank. Article 6 amends the protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities. Articles 7 to 10 are part of the treaty's transitional and final provisions and provide, inter alia, for certain repeals consequent to the new provisions of the Treaty of Nice. All of these Articles are, therefore, included in the Bill.Articles 11, 12 and 13, also part of the treaty's transitional and final provisions, concern matters of international treaty law. They provide that the treaty is concluded for an unlimited period, set out how it is to be ratified and when it is to enter into force, and list those languages in which it is to be equally authentic. It is not, therefore, deemed necessary that these aspects of the Treaty of Nice become part of domestic law.There are four protocols to the treaty, which form part of the Bill. Two are particularly important. The protocol on enlargement sets out the new arrangements governing the European Parliament, the weighting of votes in the Council and the composition of the Commission. The protocol on the statute of the Court of Justice makes significant changes to the functioning of the court, intended to allow it cope with enlargement and its greater caseload.In keeping with past practice, the terms of the Bill have been carefully drafted to ensure that only those provisions of the Treaty of Nice which it is necessary to make part of domestic law prior to ratification are made part of Irish law. The Government has not sought to go any further than is necessary in order to achieve that aim. This is the prudent and proper approach. Once the Bill has been enacted it will be possible for Ireland to draw up and deposit its instrument of ratification with the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome, the depository of all the treaties.The terms of the Treaty of Nice state it will enter into force "on the first day of the second month following that in which the instrument of ratification is deposited by the last signatory state to fulfil that formality." As Ireland will be the last signatory state to take that important step, if we deposit our instrument of ratification before the end of this year, as the Government expects, the treaty will enter into force at the start of February. The timing of this could not be more significant. As Senators are aware, there are 12 countries currently negotiating to join the European Union, ten of which are expected to be ready to sign an accession treaty later in the spring. In a real way Ireland will be opening the door to allow them in.The enlargement negotiations for the ten countries concerned are drawing to a close. The meeting of the European Council in Brussels at the end of October – in welcoming the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Nice treaty – endorsed a Commission paper which stated the ten countries in question – Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia – fulfilled the political criteria and would be able to fulfil the economic criteria to assume the obligations of membership from the beginning of 2004.The Council decided to allow the Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate states on all outstanding issues by early November, with a view to concluding enlargement negotiations at the European Council in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December and signing the accession treaty in Athens in April 2003. This process remains on track, as was confirmed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council earlier this week.We should not lose sight of the fact that all of the candidate countries have made enormous sacrifices to come this far. Achieving the standards necessary to join the European Union has forced all of them to make difficult choices and take tough decisions. Despite the attempts of a great many people to offer reassurance, there is absolutely no doubt that the result of the first referendum on the Nice treaty was a serious blow to the aspirations and hopes of these states. It threw into doubt the European Union's ability to achieve the timetable to which we had all been working. The result of the second referendum was, therefore, particularly welcome in the ten countries concerned. The decision taken last month is widely appreciated within these states as being of major significance to them. There is a sense of deep gratitude to the Irish people. I come across this gratitude on every occasion I visit a Council or convention meeting and the degree to which the Irish are held in high regard is astonishing. The vote by the people is seen as a generous act of solidarity of a small nation with which they have much in common.In all the discussions we have had on the future direction of the European Union – whether in the debate that preceded the referendum, in the National Forum on Europe or elsewhere – there has been an overwhelming national consensus in favour of enlargement. Irish people, who have themselves felt the pain of conflict and division, see the expansion of the Union and the ending of the unnatural division of the European continent as a project of historic importance. When Ireland deposits its instrument of ratification, one of the final few pieces of the jigsaw will fall into place.The Government is conscious of the reason Ireland will be the last country to ratify the treaty. Had the people not voted "No" in the first referendum, we would have expected to have completed the necessary procedures more than a year ago. However, while this would clearly have made our lives considerably simpler, we would not have had the thorough and detailed debate on the future of the European Union and Ireland's role in it that led up to the second referendum. We have all gained from the experience, difficult as it was.Successive Governments had, perhaps, tended to take it for granted that the generally strong support which most Irish people continue to feel towards the European Union would automatically translate into a favourable outcome in any related referendum. As a result of the outcome of the first referendum, we have all had to reassess that position and learn that there was no room for complacency. That we did so and responded in a positive and active way to concerns raised was reflected in the outcome of the second vote.Without rerunning the referendum campaign, there are a few points worth making. Last year's result made it very clear that we were not engaging the people sufficiently well in wider debates about the future of Europe. That was a fundamental mistake. Many were of the view matters were changing in a way that gave them little opportunity to discuss what was happening and make their views and opinions heard in a meaningful way. In response to this concern, the Government established the National Forum on Europe which, under the excellent chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, has already made an enormously valuable contribution to furthering national debate on European issues. When I discuss this aspect of our referendum in either Council meetings or at the convention, there is considerable interest in the workings of our national forum, in particular in the manner in which it handled the broad process of education and debate on Europe. It will be a model for similar fora in other jurisdictions.I particularly commend the efforts of the forum to take the debate out to the people. All too often discussion of Europe is perceived to be a matter for elites – whether political, academic or bureaucratic. It has not generally been seen as something that shapes and touches peoples' lives and the places where they live. The forum road show has brought debate to more or less every corner of the country. It has taken it out of the rarefied halls of Dublin Castle and into the suburbs, the countryside and the provincial cities and towns in which the people live their lives. As a result, the debate has acquired a much more localised and genuine flavour.Discussion of the future shape of the European Union is continuing, with the involvement of the European convention, a subject to which I will return. The Government is very pleased that, having played such an important part in facilitating discussion on enlargement and different aspects of the Treaty of Nice, the forum will again be playing a central role in ensuring the Irish people continue to have a full say.The first referendum outcome also reflected a feeling held by some that EU legislation was somehow being imposed without their representatives in the Dáil and Seanad having the opportunity to examine it properly. As the House will be aware, the Joint Committee on European Affairs is now at the centre of new scrutiny measures which ensure every legislative or policy proposal coming from the European Union can be given appropriate consideration in the Oireachtas. Work began in July and, through the European Union (Scrutiny) Act, 2002, the arrangements have now been put on a statutory footing. Our arrangements are now on a par with those operating in any member state and infinitely superior to those in most.The committee's work is a significant step towards addressing the democratic deficit sometimes associated with Europe. I pay particular tribute to its members who are doing such an excellent job in a new and challenging area. People's doubts about Europe have also sometimes included a sense that it will be difficult to preserve what makes Ireland distinct and different, particularly in an enlarged and much more populous Union.Although I have always believed that our individuality has been enhanced and enriched through our membership of the European Union, I know that for many there was a fear that, in particular, our distinctive national policy of military neutrality could be encroached upon without the people being given the chance to decide the matter for themselves. In the declarations at Seville earlier this summer the Government and our partners in Europe made it very clear this was not the case. The necessary assurances were certainly contained in the declarations. Nothing in the treaties in any way impinges upon Ireland's neutral status. However, to offer further assurance that no change would be made without the people's say-so, the wording of the second referendum proposed a constitutional prohibition on Ireland joining any EU common defence without first having the ratification of the people. I am pleased that, as a result of last month's vote, this position is now enshrined in the Constitution, the appropriate place for it and the best guarantee the people can have on the issue.Looking back at the journey we have made, the single most important lesson learned is that the Government and elected representatives generally need to listen more carefully and respond more actively. The message on Europe must be communicated in respect of which the media as well as political leaders have a role to play. As we saw in the recent referendum, civil society must more actively engage with developments in Europe. As a nation, we must learn to become far more confident about our place in Europe, our capacity to mould the community and the significance of our involvement and contribution. We sometimes sell ourselves short. When I speak to people from other European states, I recognise the high regard in which we are held. People, who have been involved in European affairs for a long time, have considerable regard for the ability of the Irish people to deal with complex issues relating to Europe. We have always punched above our weight as a nation, but the degree of understanding Irish people have of European affairs is probably greater than we sometimes give ourselves credit for.This is an enduring lesson that we will all do well to remember, particularly as the debate on Europe's future begins to take shape at the European convention. The people must be informed and involved. The convention has undertaken an ambitious task. Under the declaration at Laeken it is to look at the key questions facing the Union at a time of great challenge and change in its development. It is to examine how Europe can be brought closer to its citizens, something with which we can all identify. It will examine how Europe can play a full and active part in a rapidly changing, global environment and how it can be better organised to meet these challenges.The convention, which brings together representatives of Governments and Parliaments from the member and applicant states together with MEPs and representatives of the Commission, has been meeting since February, but its work has recently begun to gather pace. In last week's meeting of the forum, Senator Maurice Hayes made a very appropriate comparison. He suggested that something that started out like the west Clare railway line was now coming down the tracks like a TGV. The convention's process is unique. It involves, not only representatives of the member state Governments, but also representatives of the member state Parliaments and the European Parliament. It also involves representatives of the Parliaments and Governments of the applicant states. It is a uniquely open body in that all of its papers are available on the Internet. The criticism made about the process of producing previous treaties will no longer be valid in this case. What is taking place is happening in the open and those who wish to be engaged can have access.Six of the ten working groups operating within the convention have produced reports. The four remaining groups will complete their reports before Christmas. At the end of October the convention president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, brought forward what he called a "preliminary draft constitutional treaty." It sets out, in very outline form, the areas he sees being included in a future treaty. The convention is working towards completing its task and bringing forward a set of recommendations by consensus early in the summer of 2003. These recommendations will be a key input to the Intergovernmental Conference that will follow.It will be for Governments in the Intergovernmental Conference to make decisions and reach final conclusions. However, the outcome of the convention will be highly significant. I am pleased to be representing Ireland as the Government representative. I also pay tribute to the Oireachtas representatives, Deputies Pat Carey, John Bruton and John Gormley, and Proinsias De Rossa MEP, who are playing an extraordinary role and have given a huge amount of time and energy. Sadly, their active role has not always been appropriately recognised.Guided in no small measure by our recent experience, we are stressing within the convention the need for an approach which takes full account of what people feel about and expect from the Union. Our approach is informed by a sense that Irish people are broadly comfortable with the current distribution of competence between member states and the Union. They do not want to see massive steps forward towards increasing integration, nor do they wish to retreat to simple inter-governmentalism. We believe that the Irish people are also broadly happy with the way in which the institutions work and do not want to see the current careful balances between them upset or set aside.We believe that genuine and meaningful steps can and should be taken towards giving people greater ownership of the European project through, for example, making the treaties simpler and more accessible or through making the principle of subsidiarity more effective in its application – without resort to gimmicks such as changing the name of the Union. On this latter point, while Giscard d'Estaing's draft makes four suggestions, I firmly believe that people are comfortable with the title European Union and that there is little support for change. There is certainly no support for it to be called the United States of Europe, with all that title conjures up.Overall, it is a question of striking the right balance – protecting what is good about the Union while preparing for the challenges ahead. I hope that, if the right approach is taken, it should prove possible to reach an outcome that will endure and stand the test of time and that the sense that the Union is constantly being modified and reconstructed will be at an end. The Union has been like a building site for 50 years and it is time that process was bedded down. The convention and the treaty that follows should do that.That is all for the future. I know the Seanad will continue to follow matters with great interest and to make an intelligent and meaningful contribution – as it always does – through its debates. Today the task before us is to take a further step towards ratification of the Treaty of Nice. As I hope I have explained, the Bill is a simple one, but it is significant and I warmly commend it to the House.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I apologise for the unavoidable absence of our spokesperson on European and foreign affairs, Senator Bradford, owing to a family bereavement.I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House. Despite the fact that this is a short Bill, his final sentence summed up its significance. If the electorate had not given a strong "Yes" vote, we would not be debating this Bill today and would probably have to adopt a different stance.I endorse the Minister of State's sentiments in complimenting the role played by the forum for Europe in explaining the shortfalls apparent in the first referendum. Were it not for some of the individuals on the forum travelling around the country, encouraging the electorate with a convincing message, a sizeable proportion of the electorate might have abstained or voted "No". The Minister of State said that in the many places he has been since the referendum he has received warm praise and acknowledgement that Ireland had been generous in support of the treaty. That is welcome.The analysis of our role in Europe since 1973 has always classified us as strong pro-Europeans. For a number of reasons, support for our pro-European stance has recently declined substantially. Where once it had 70% approval, that figure has now declined. I agree with the Minister of State's analysis that this is probably our own fault for not explaining the European message adequately over the years. We became complacent, as evidenced by the result of the first referendum on the Treaty of Nice. It is good that we have re-established ourselves in a positive light in Europe. One wonders what the headlines would have been in Europe and at home if we had taken the wrong decision last month.We must accept that the core "No" vote did not change from the first occasion and further effort must be made to explain if there is a deficit in information or whether these people should be brought on board, their talents used and their grievances recognised. Many people who voted "No" had legitimate concerns and I am not sure they have been addressed. I hope this House could go some way to addressing the difficulties and fears that a sizeable proportion of the population still have in relation to many of the issues raised, for example, enlargement, neutrality and the common defence force. Some people are suspicious that we will be dragged into war, despite the fact that we have included in our Constitution a paragraph which defines our involvement.There is still a need to address the democratic deficit and to continue the forum on Europe. I hope the personnel involved could be persuaded, with others, to continue in a formal manner – perhaps not as intensively as in the run up to the referendum but at least it could be seen to be active several times a year. As a former member of the European affairs committee, I hope this House will have an identifiable and increasing role in our contact with Europe and that the democratic deficit the Minister of State has identified can be reduced, if not eliminated, through our efforts.There must be a mechanism whereby we can bring EU Commissioners to our Chamber. The Agriculture Commissioner attended the European Affairs Committee recently to explain CAP reform and other changes in agriculture policy.As the Minister of State will be aware, I have previously drawn attention to certain changes which are necessary in national legislation and in the administration of various schemes in a manner which currently penalises people, as was never intended under European directives and regulations. In the context of penalties and fines in relation to schemes of grants, premia and agricultural support mechanisms, Agriculture House has put in place a regime which is cruel and objectionable. Farmers who make a small human error are disproportionately penalised and, in effect, condemned as fraudulently seeking benefits under the schemes. Evidently, officials in Agriculture House cannot see the reality that to err is human and that it is their job to rectify matters. The Minister of State had a substantial input in dealing with particular cases in that regard over several years.The severe penalties being imposed by the Department of Agriculture and Food for minor technical infringements are quite disproportionate and do not take account of the fact that the farmers affected never had any fraudulent intention. No doubt, there are those in every EU country who set out to make fraudulent gain and, as it were, beat the system. However, in the vast majority of cases, the benefit withdrawn and penalties imposed on farmers are totally disproportionate to the relatively minor transgressions involved. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has put in place a supposedly independent appeals mechanism which, in reality, is anything but independent. In 90% of cases the appeals board is made up of former Department employees who are quite familiar with many of the cases under appeal, having been involved in processing them in their previous capacity.I urge the Minister of State to take steps to establish a mechanism whereby EU directives and national legislation which have caused consternation and pain to many can be amended to remove the penal elements to which I have referred. The habitats directive which affects an incredible proportion of this country is one such example. Undoubtedly, it was never intended that the operation of the directive would penalise people to the extent of preventing them from carrying on their normal, traditional practices in making a living from the land. I fully acknowledge the need to protect the environment. However, the environment, habitats, natural features and ancient monuments were preserved to a much higher standard by farmers and property owners prior to the relevant EU directives being introduced. People were proud of their heritage and happy to protect it. Some mechanism must be found to explain those directives and implement them in a less penal manner. That would have a major impact on eliminating the objections of a significant element of the "No" vote in recent referenda on EU issues.I hope the Minister of State, in the context of his special role in European affairs, will promote opportunities for greater involvement of this House in examining and debating EU legislation on a similar basis to the work of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. At one stage the volume of work in that committee made it necessary to bring in consultants to process the documentation and provide advice for the committee. I suggest that greater involvement of this House in the process would be a valuable contribution.I welcome the Bill. In the absence of any financial implications, I see nothing contentious in its overall contents. However, I remind the Minister of State that, during the Nice treaty referendum campaign, it required our best endeavours, across the political spectrum, to get the support of very many people who were determined on voting "No" because of their deep dissatisfaction with the Government. In effect, the Government was spared on that occasion, but there will be another day to deal with the cruel cut-backs now being introduced in the aftermath of the deceit of the recent past. The Government only escaped because people were open to persuasion to place the long-term consideration of European enlargement before short-term concerns.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State. I wish him well in his ministerial portfolio and look forward to working with him on European policy issues. When I was given the assignment of speaking in the debate on this Bill and got down to researching and studying the matter with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, my initial feeling was one of being somewhat overwhelmed by eurospeak jargon. However, having reflected and thought the matter through, I agree with the Minister of State that the basic elements of the Bill are really quite simple in terms of endorsing the provisions of the treaty and incorporating them into domestic law. That is a necessary part of the process to enable the Nice treaty to take its place alongside earlier EU treaties dating back to 1972.The Minister of State referred to the role of the European Court of Justice in relation to some elements of the treaty. Perhaps in his reply to the debate he will enlarge on the actual workings of EU institutions in that regard. I am interested in all the institutions and their role, also in the various treaties, the Coal and Steel Community, the upgrading of the central bank systems in Europe, as well as the European Central Bank. I began to think about this area and realised that I did not understand where it fitted into my thinking. I did not think about it before but perhaps I am slow in my approach to the background. Perhaps we all are and this is the problem. Seán Citizen would say that he does not know what is going on. This is a golden opportunity to launch our interest in Europe and perhaps the best place to do it is from this Chamber.The first "No" vote may have created huge concerns for applicant countries but, in hindsight, it did us a favour. Each of us had to start thinking about the problems. They were divided into two areas. People had no difficulty with the concept of enlargement. We wanted other countries to join, as we did in 1972. The problem was the future of Europe and its impact on Irish citizens. The referendum failed the first time because we took the people for granted. I did not canvass because I thought it was a fait accompli, nothing to do with me. However, the public told me it had to do with me. People were not prepared to vote for something they knew nothing about. In hindsight, the “No” vote stimulated discussion on the reason for the failure of the proposed amendment, on the feeling that Europe was far removed, and that there was a democratic deficit and no control over proposals made and ratified in Europe which we had no opportunity to discuss.This was why the forum on Europe was founded. I compliment its chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes. He was intuitive enough to know how to guide the debate on the future of Europe. He took it away from Dublin Castle and brought it to the four corners of Ireland. He invited anyone who was interested to engage in a free exchange of ideas and opinions on how to move forward. I congratulate him on having the foresight to know what was needed and to tap into the fundamentals of Europe.The Nice treaty will be ratified and we must continue the debate on Europe to see where we go from here. What kind of a model do we want for Europe? What kind of institutions do we want? Should we be integrated into Europe while retaining our individuality? How best can we do this? These are the questions I ask. We have been given ownership of the European project.I congratulate the Government on providing that any legislation or proposals to Brussels will be fielded first by the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Only through the Oireachtas can we have accountability to the public. There have been directives and regulations of which we only heard when they were finalised in Europe. We had no input into the discussions on the proposals and their implementation. Perhaps it was the failure of the first Nice referendum which caused us to start thinking.Senator Burke talked about how best to use this Chamber to reach out to the public. We have a golden opportunity to highlight aspects of directives or regulations which worry people. We can invite them in. The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, discussed with us his ideas on the future shape of Europe. I welcome greater use of the Chamber.The media have a huge role to play and I wonder if we will get two minutes of media time tonight. There are five or six of us here and they will say there are only four present. This discussion concerns an important element of ratification of the Nice treaty which will launch the accession of the ten countries who are ready to join the European Union. It is an opportunity for the media to tell the public we are trying to reach out to them. We cannot do it alone. I ask the media to give us a chance to do the work for itself and for Seán Citizen.There is a select committee which cannot include Senators because it deals only with legislation. Could Senators who are interested in the subject become involved? I am only coming to grips with the subject and must ask questions. I understand the concept of the European Convention and that it is made up of parliamentarians, ministers, MEPs and members of the Commission. Will the Convention reach out to European citizens? I am a little unclear on this and would like the Minister to explain it. There are a number of elements, the select committee, the joint Oireachtas committee, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Council of Ministers and the Commission and we can become bogged down. We need to clarify our role in reaching out to members of the public to reassure them that we reflect their views. It is why I am here and what I have to do. I want to give people feedback on how we are doing and how we can shape the future of Europe.This is a small country but it is fantastic. Its geographic location is beautiful because it makes us independent. We want to be part of Europe but we are unique in that we are apart from the mainland and can have our own style. How best can we integrate European thinking and retain our identity as a nation in our culture, language and lifestyle? There is a fear that we will become absorbed in Europe to the extent of being more European than Irish. I want the opposite. I want us to be Irish and participate in Europe. That is the way I want to go forward.I have given the Minster a few thoughts and I look forward to working with him in all the areas I have mentioned. This is the launching pad for the ratification of the treaty. We can now go forward in Europe with a broad brief as to its future and how we can be part of it while retaining our identity. Today we are taking steps to put this in motion. I look forward to the discussion continuing for many months.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I endorse the general approach taken in the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which reflects the approach to treaty changes over the last ten years or so, since the Single European Act. It is right that we should reserve issues that arise under the second and third pillars for debate within the Oireachtas as far as possible, while translating Community issues straight into Irish law. I looked at the treaty to see if I could match them up, but I quickly realised that it is more useful to trust one's legal advice rather than second-guessing it. It is beyond me how the Government decided that one approach was suitable for the treaties and another for second and third pillar issues. The Labour Party certainly endorses the general approach from a political point of view, however.The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have had a much more pleasant time at the recent meeting of the General Affairs Council as a result of the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. I welcome the outcome of the Council's deliberations as it is useful that we have a specific timetable for the accession of the ten countries which are waiting to join the Union. It is right that the states in question should be given adequate time to make a decision on the accession treaties when they are signed.A number of issues that arise in that context should be considered. As I said at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week, I am not sure if we should look to admit Cyprus without a resolution of the issues that remain between the two parts of that divided island. We hope the talks currently under way, brokered by the United Nations, will lead to a resolution of the issue in advance of accession. The decision to admit Cyprus has been taken and it is unlikely that it will be reversed.The more important matter of the admission of Turkey to the European Union is also worthy of consideration. This issue has implications beyond the accession of Turkey as it brings into play an issue touched on by Senator Ormonde – our citizens' sense of ownership of, and confidence in, the Union. Without wishing to endorse specifically the recent remarks of the former President of France, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, I believe there is merit in many of his sentiments. If we are to have a sense of ownership of the European project, as citizens of Ireland and of Europe, we have to have a sense of identity with what we think of as Europe. One cannot go beyond the boundaries of Europe in looking to create that sense of identity as to do so is to risk losing it. People in Ireland, Finland or Portugal do not believe that Europe extends to the Turkish border with Iraq as it is simply not the case.If Turkey is admitted to the EU, it will be the largest member state in terms of population and size, meaning that the Union will be irrevocably changed both in terms of what it already is and what it can aspire to become. Turkey's accession would inevitably mean that the Union would remain a loose association of nation states for the foreseeable future. I do not want to see such a Union as I believe in deepening the nature of the relationship between the member states. It seems that the Government does not share my interest in that regard, an issue to which I will return. There is merit in being candid by saying to our Turkish friends that while we will deal with them in terms of economic agreements and including them in the Single Market regulations, we do not believe that Turkish membership of the EU is possible. The bulk of Turks are not European and do not aspire to being European. The United States of America would not admit Mexico because Mexico is not part of the US and never will be.I read with some concern last week the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and perhaps the Minister of State will clarify one or two matters in that regard. During visits to the accession states last year, the Taoiseach and the President announced that diplomatic representatives are to be based in Slovenia, Estonia and Slovakia. I believe a decision has been taken, in principle, to establish resident embassies in all the accession states. The Estimates indicate that the budget for the Department of Foreign Affairs will decrease by 5% next year. It would be helpful if the Minister of State would clarify whether our intention to establish resident embassies in the accession states has been deferred by virtue of the decisions taken by the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs. I also noted with concern that the specific heading in the Estimates which deals with pre-accession assistance to EU candidate countries has been cut by 8%. I am not sure that this measure sends out the preferred signal in the immediate aftermath of the Nice treaty referendum.The Minister of State touched on some broader EU issues in the latter part of his contribution. Now that the Nice treaty has been passed by the electorate, there is a danger that the interest in the European project will be allowed to wane. I agree with other speakers that the debate we have had on Europe in the last three months has been healthy, generally speaking, and that it would be wrong to allow it to come to a halt. Major decisions are being taken in the context of the Convention on the Future of Europe. As Senator Ormonde said, it is important that both Houses should play a part in determining the outcome of the convention. The Minister of State, for the first time to the best of my knowledge, spelt out the Government's approach when he said he believes that the Government and the Irish people are "broadly comfortable with the current distribution of competence between member states and the Union" and that they are happy with the balance of power between the various elements of the Union. I do not agree with the Minister's remarks, as I believe they betray the Government's complacency and contradict what is said elsewhere.We have to confront a serious problem. There should be greater democracy and accountability in the European Union; we are blue in the face hearing it and articulating it in recent months. When one pursues what people mean by these ideas, however, one quickly runs into a series of contradictions. It appears that when the Government says the EU should be more accountable or democratic, it means that we should emphasise the intergovernmental aspects of the EU. In other words, the Government, through the Council of Ministers, should basically be able to say "Yea" or "Nay" and the other elements of the EU, such as the Commission, the Parliament and the European Court of Justice, should retain the competences they already have, or indeed lose them. I do not share that view of how to make the Union more democratic as such ideas do not help to make the institutions of the Union more democratic.The Government's view is that the national veto and national sovereignty should be supreme. While such mechanisms have worked reasonably well up to now, I do not believe they are sustainable in the context of an enlarged Union which will have almost twice as many member states as the present Union, 27 as opposed to the current 15. In the changed circumstances we will face intergovernmentalism and the predominant position of the Council of Ministers is neither sustainable nor desirable. If we are to look to enhance the powers of the Commission and the Parliament, as I believe we should, we have to ensure they are connected back down to the nation states. Ideas such as those put forward by other countries, such as the election of the President of the Commission by the Parliament or directly, are useful and welcome. It is a shame that the Government is complacently standing back and saying it is quite happy with the division of competence as it stands. I do not believe the current division can be sustained or that we should look to sustain it.As I understand it, the Government's position on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights is that while it finds it interesting as a statement of general principle, it does not intend to give it any effect in law. This is a short sighted approach, although I do not underestimate the difficulties of marrying our Constitution with an international declaration. Our approach to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is over 50 years old, is that it has persuasive force but it does not override our Constitution. Ireland undertakes, generally speaking, to give effect in Irish law to the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. Given that the list of countries subscribing to the European Convention on Human Rights will soon be almost the same as the list of member states, I do not think it would have been difficult to devise a mechanism whereby the convention can be amalgamated with the charter and that, in turn, can be related to the Irish Constitution. I appreciate that there are legal difficulties but we should look to overcome them nevertheless. If Europe is to be more than a Single Market or a businessman's Europe, it has to be grounded in rights which are given to individual European citizens. These rights, in turn, have to be enshrined in a charter or a basic law. I do not think it would be beyond the wit of our legal people to relate that to the Irish Constitution. Instead, I understand the Irish position is that while this is all very interesting and full of good ideas, we do not intend to implement it in a serious way, which I regret.We must reconsider the issue of tax harmonisation. It has been a particular mantra in recent years of the more right wing element of the Government, including the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, that we do not want to go down this road. However, it ignores the fact that we are already well down that road in regard to a number of other taxes such as excise duty and VAT. I believe we must consider providing for a minimum level of corporation tax. The level will shortly be 12.5%, the lowest in the European Union as it currently exists. I would put any money on it that in a few years' time 12.5% will be quite excessive vis-à-vis the level of corporation tax which will then be levied by some of the accession countries. We will very shortly find ourselves whingeing, as others have done to us, that our foreign direct investment into Ireland is being snatched away unfairly by the accession states which are levying a lower rate of corporation tax. We will very quickly find ourselves in a position where we must contemplate cutting public services because we cannot sustain the level of corporation tax. I do not think we need to go down that road but we need a change in thinking. We need those with a little more foresight than the current Minister for Finance or the current Tánaiste to give some thought to this issue. They will quickly conclude that it is in Ireland's national interest, quite apart from the broader issues involved, to ensure, among other things, that we provide for a minimum level of corporation tax throughout the European Union.I am very happy to endorse the approach being taken in the Bill. I am very pleased we are here and that the people endorsed the Nice referendum. As other Members said, there are lessons to be drawn from the way the campaign was run. The one thing we can all say with certainty is that the people can never again be taken for granted on these types of issues. Now is the time to begin debating the greater issues of the convention which will undoubtedly be put to the people by way of referendum in two or three years' time.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend the all-party leadership shown in the recent Nice referendum. I congratulate in particular Deputy John Bruton and our Leader, Deputy Kenny, who had the vision and foresight to realise this was not a political mission. As it was in the interests of the people we decided to leave politics out of it.I would like to refer to the parochial element of Donegal in light of the recent referendum where 64% of the people decided not to vote. I pre-empted this when I spoke to the Minister about the issue prior to the referendum and I also mentioned it to the MEP, Pat Cox. Some 64% of people in Donegal, a regional peripheral location, probably one of the most peripheral regions of the European project, locked in between Northern Ireland and bordering just a seven mile stretch with the Republic, decided that the European project was meaningless. They felt completely disenfranchised as was shown in the democratic deficit in the recent referendum. Lessons must be learned from this. There will be other referenda when the same scaremongering will take place about the democratic deficit. Rather than being critical, we should be constructive. We should consider seriously proposals from the committee of regions and the assembly of European regions where there is serious talk about subsidiarity, regional autonomy and giving more power and responsibility to local authorities and local regions.Perhaps it was an oversight on the part of the Leader of this House but my colleague, Senator Burke, asked for an immediate debate on the Border, midland and western regions. The former Minister and Leader of the House failed to respond to this request, even though I know she did not mean it. However, it is indicative of what is happening in the country whereby a BMW region was set out. This was basically a paper region to apply for Objective One status which had no structures. The European Union still has the power and ability to set up structures, whether at regional or local authority level, particularly nowadays when the Minister for Finance is withdrawing funding from local authorities because of the state of the economy. We must begin to empower local authorities through the European Union.I have tabled a motion for the next Donegal County Council meeting seeking a pilot European Union office, a tangible office where people can come in off the street and get information on Europe. They could find out about their entitlements, what is happening and what will happen in Europe. That is the only way to instil confidence in the democratic process at European level. We have already done this at Donegal County Council level. We have opened two new decentralised offices, one in Millford and one in Carndonagh, where people can come in off the street, find out about the local authority, which was centralised in Lifford, and pay their car tax. If there was a European sub-office in one of the offices, it would help to instil confidence in the European process. This brings me to local government reform in general. This aspect could be tied in to local government reform if we are serious about the issue.I welcome the recent Nice referendum result which sends out a very positive message to the rest of Europe. If one were to survey the 64% of people who did not vote in the referendum, we would find that they did want enlargement. Basically it was a complicated project of which they did not feel part. They felt isolated from the process, which is a challenge we cannot ignore. However, if we ignore it, we will do so at our peril.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The contributions have been most interesting and it is extraordinary how they overlap with the ongoing discussions on the convention. I am pleased to conclude the Second Stage debate and I am grateful for the support of Members. I am gratified that the approach adopted in the Bill has universal approval, particularly the decisions made on those issues which were kept outside the regulation making competence of the European Communities Act, 1972.As I made clear at the outset, the Bill is very technical in character. However, it touches on a huge range of areas. It seeks to amend the European Communities Act, 1972, by adding relevant sections from the Treaty of Nice to the list of European Union treaties set out in the Act. There have been similar amendments in all the other cases where we have ratified treaties. This is a well tried and proven approach. Assuming that we deposit our instrument of ratification in December, the Treaty of Nice will, as a result of the work we are doing here, finally take effect on 1 February 2003.I will refer briefly to the contributions made by Members. Senator Burke made the point that we must address the difficulties and fears of a sizeable proportion of the population who voted "No". This theme was carried through in virtually all the other contributions. Senator McHugh finished on that particular point. The Senator is correct in saying there is a need for us to be involved in an ongoing process of communication with citizens in regard to the European Union. This is very important because we are part of Europe. We contribute to Europe in all sorts of ways.As I mentioned earlier, we have a lack of confidence in our capacity to play a role in Europe. This is completely unwarranted considering what we did in October and the level of debate. When it comes to European affairs we have, if not an unparallelled grasp, a grasp which is unusual in European states. A Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in one of the incoming states told me that during the course of the referendum campaign he arrived in Dublin and was travelling by taxi with a voluble driver who was talking about the Nice treaty. The minister asked the taxi driver how the referendum would go and the driver said, stroking his chin, that he was not terribly certain. He then confounded his passenger by launching into a long, learned diatribe on enhanced co-operation and qualified majority voting. The minister told me that if the degree of expertise of the taxi driver existed in some ministries abroad, he would be quite happy.Senator Burke is right in that there is a need for ongoing debate. Senator McDowell also touched on this in his contribution. Debate is essential on where we are going in Europe and the future of Europe. As I said earlier to the chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, I am anxious that the debate be opened to the public so that it does not merely take place between Departments or Ministers. This is critically important. While we might differ on some of the issues, I agree with both Senators. It is not sufficient for us to dismiss some of the arguments that were made. Senator Burke mentioned people's fears about neutrality. It is not enough for us to say that has been addressed in the declaration or in the new constitutional amendment. We must understand what people are concerned about, listen to their fears and allay them. We must respect their views. One of the most important lessons of the last debate was that we must respect that there are different views on this issue. We will never reach absolute consensus on everything, although we are all aiming in the same direction.Senator Burke mischievously referred to my own interest in public administration and how it relates, in the most general sense, to the citizen. I agree with him. I made this point in the convention debate – if the EU in its many aspects loses contact with its citizens, the cause has been lost. It is important that issues such as proportionality be borne in mind by administrators when they are applying rules which, although they say they originate in Brussels, frequently originate here. The point at which the State or the EU interfaces with the powerless citizen is always important in public administration. The lesson should be learned that the citizen's view should always be borne in mind.The Senators are right when they suggest that some of the antipathy reflected towards Europe is really antipathy towards an administrative process which does not adequately recognise the frailties of human beings and lumps everybody who makes an error on a form together with those who wish to be criminal. Nobody in this House or the other House – nobody I have ever met in public life – would support criminality. We want our administrators to operate with a modicum of humanity. That is one of the facets of the process at the heart of the Convention on the Future of Europe – issues such as simplification are being dealt with and people's views deserve to be taken on board.Senator Ormonde is quite right in saying that this is a technical Bill. The aim, however, is very simple. The Senator did make an interesting point when she referred to the difficulty in coming to grips with the complexity of the different competences within the Community. She spoke, for example, of the competence of the European Court of Justice and how there is a need for work to be done on this. This arises at the Convention on the Future of Europe. There is a rather peculiar working group called Complementary Competencies in which it is being discussed. Another section of the convention, in which legal personality is being discussed, is dealing with the creation of a single, homogeneous, unified European Union with fewer of the complications to which the Senator made reference.Senator Ormonde also dealt with the Convention on the Future of Europe. It is not my place to provide a brief on the Convention on the Future of Europe but if Members of the Seanad were interested in having a debate on that it would be very useful.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	193	We asked for that.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I would be willing to co-operate with the Senators. Senator Ormonde will know this from yet another forum earlier today, but if any Senator is interested in the future of Europe debate and where the convention is going, I will do my best to provide as objective a briefing as possible. It is important that we learn from the past and engage everybody in the community in debate. The debate does not belong only to the Government or to those in political parties but to the whole citizenry.Senator McDowell's contribution was interesting and challenging. I was pleased with his endorsement of the general approach adopted in the Bill. He is correct in saying that it is a good thing to keep issues arising under the second and third pillars, most of which require legislation, for debate in the Oireachtas. We should continue to do this. I suspect that at the back of the Senator's mind when he made his contribution, was the debate during the recent referendum on the fact that there was rubber-stamping of material coming from Europe without primary legislation being put through the House. In the areas to which he made reference, this Bill retains the requirement of primary legislation and will not go down the secondary legislation route.I am not sure that I agree with some of the other views expressed by the Senator. He will hardly be surprised by that. I disagree with him, for example, on his suggestion that saying the Irish people are generally happy with the balance displays a degree of complacency. He must accept my assurance that this is not the case. There has been a fair degree of analysis of where those balances are and what is most appropriate to Ireland as a small nation. He will accept, although I do not suggest that he wanted to go beyond this, that the current balances within the Community, broadly speaking, are very favourable to smaller states. We should be careful not to open a Pandora's box and disturb those balances. By being conservative in that sense, we know what direction is best for our interests. The Senator made a number of interesting contributions on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and whether it should be incorporated into the forthcoming treaty or annexed to it and how and where it will apply. Again, a wider debate is needed here.The Senator also made reference to taxation. All the Members will shortly become aware that I issued a very strong letter to the president of the convention pointing out that we must defend the right of nation states to make the ultimate decision on taxation. I see the Senator's point that there is a reason for debate on this within Europe, but the very strong view we are taking—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	195	We are only happy when we are undercutting everybody else. When they start to undercut us we will have a problem.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We will be undercut, as the Senator knows. In Estonia there is a zero rate of corporation tax. Notwithstanding this, we need to be very careful. I put a marker down at the convention the week before last and made it absolutely clear that we were not prepared to surrender an inch. It is not just the Irish who are concerned. The Swedes take a similar view and are strongly opposed to interference in this area. The issue relates generally to the policies operated by governments in their own states. The British would be of the same view. There are a couple of states lined up on the issue.Senator McDowell made the point that we must learn from the last referendum. We need to look at the reports. He mentioned the Committee of the Regions. An interesting report has been produced by one of the working groups which deals with subsidiarity within the convention. There is a related report by one of the working groups that deals with the role of national parliaments. If the Seanad decided to debate this area, it would be interesting to discuss those issues. Subsidiarity and its meaning are being dealt with. It is interesting how they are being dealt with by the convention. It has recognised that, although the term "subsidiarity" has been broadly used before, it has not been tightly tied down.Before Senator McDowell asks, I am not certain what the dates are for the opening of our embassies in the accession states, but I am sure that they will open as funds allow.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I could only guess at this time.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	201	It is noticeable that accession states are opening resident embassies all over Dublin. The Slovenian Embassy has opened on Dawson Street, but we still have very few residential embassies in the countries concerned bar the two or three biggest ones. It would be detrimental to our economic as well as political interests if the process of opening embassies were to slow down as a result of short-term cuts.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	202	We are about to open embassies in Slovenia and Estonia. I will come back with the details.Senators have been concerned about the quality of EU legislation and its impact on the public. Senator Ormonde mentioned the role the media have to play. I do not want to knock the media, but extraordinary work has been done in the Oireachtas, particularly by the Oireachtas joint committee, dealing with some of the complex issues that have come from Europe and it has not received the time it merits, particularly in the electronic media. The media played a very positive role in the referendum, with the team on "Morning Ireland" making a contribution by defining the key issues in a non-judgmental way. That was absolutely marvellous public service broadcasting. Without being partisan, the programme teased out issues.Complex issues are now arising in the convention and deserve attention. The convention is very open, but Irish citizens will not know it exists unless the electronic media refer to it. Compliments are due to the print media because they have people on the ground while RTÉ has sent a full-time correspondent. They make valuable contributions which are edited out because there are limits to the space available. If we are to engage people in the debate and engagement is to be paid something other than lip service, there is a role to be played by the media as well as by public representatives.It was implicit in Senator Burke's contribution that too often people equate the European Union with unnecessary bureaucratic meddling. It must be pointed out that the meddling and bureaucracy are more domestic than European. There has been a tendency for politicians to blame Europe for issues regarded as unpopular. That is a dishonest approach because nothing comes out of Europe that ultimately does not have the imprimatur of the Governments of member states. We should not lose sight of this.The European Communities (Amendment) Bill concerns the legislative implementation of directives once adopted by the Union. If there are problems in the legislation, we can look for solutions domestically. We will not always win the debates in Europe, but should be willing to play an active role. When something unpopular comes forward, we should accept that it is the consensus view.As usual, I am grateful to Senators for their contributions which have been thought provoking and useful. I hope they get the attention and time they deserve later tonight.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	209	As the subject matter of the two amendments is the same, we can discuss both of them together.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 6, before section 2, to insert the following new section:"2. The European Union (Scrutiny) Act, 2002, is amended in subsection (1) of section 1 by the insertion in paragraph (d) of the definition of ‘measure' after ‘Article 29.4.6º of ‘or 8º'.”This a technical amendment to clarify that issues and measures arising from ratification of the Nice treaty would also fall within the remit of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act, which was passed in this House in recent weeks. That Act deals with measures that arose from our existing treaty obligations and we are simply seeking to ensure it would apply to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, when passed.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank the Senator for indicating that he will withdraw his amendment in favour of the Government amendment. He has correctly pointed out that this arises from recent legislation. The amendment covers an issue separate from the main Bill. It would amend, not only the European Communities Act, 1972, but also the European Union (Scrutiny) Act, 2002. The Government is happy to take on board the substance of the Labour Party's amendment, but, on the advice of the parliamentary counsel, we have proposed a slightly different wording which the Labour Party accepts.The European Union (Scrutiny) Act places new arrangements for Oireachtas scrutiny of EU business on a statutory basis and became law in October. The first section defines the categories of proposed measures which must be subject to scrutiny while the fourth and final category defines measures requiring the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution. I discovered that there are so-called options and discretions under the Amsterdam treaty, including in the area of enhanced co-operation. Since the European Union (Scrutiny) Act became law, the twenty-sixth amendment of the Constitution took effect on 7 November. This was identified by the Labour Party when it tabled the amendment. The House will recall that this amendment, introduced in Article 29.4.8º,required the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas to be exercised by the State on the options and discretions mentioned in the Nice treaty, in this case exclusively relating to the area of enhanced co-operation.It was always the intention and understanding of the Government that any such measures under Article 29.4.8º would be subject to full scrutiny in addition to the constitutional requirement for the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. However, to remove any uncertainty and arising from the prompting of the Labour Party amendment, we are happy to make this explicit. I am grateful to the Senator and his party for agreeing to endorse the approach we have adopted. It is a good compromise.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I seek clarification on one issue. Perhaps there has been a Government announcement, but I am not clear as to the transitional arrangements that will be made arising from the decisions taken at the General Affairs and External Relations Council? For example, what are the specific arrangements in relation to the European Parliament? Will the provisions of the Nice treaty come into play at the next European Parliament elections or the subsequent ones? Has that been decided at this stage?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I can provide the Senator with a fuller note on this issue, if he wishes. Obviously, in the arrangements that are part and parcel of the Nice treaty process, provision has been made for the enlargement of the Parliament up to and including the two states which will not be part of the ten, Bulgaria and Romania. There will, therefore, be a redistribution of seats. The Senator asked if a decision was made at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting earlier in the week—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	214	A decision was taken whereby new member states would participate fully in the next elections in 2004. I presume this will be on the basis of the Nice treaty and that, therefore, there will be a reduction in the representation of Ireland to 12 seats? Has this been agreed?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Yes. The number of seats Ireland would have to contest would be 13. Given that a great deal is happening, if the Senator wishes, I can provide him with a note on the exact position on the most recent decisions. He is right—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I understand there is to be a redistribution. I am simply asking when it will come into play.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The intention is that new member states will participate in the elections in 2004, but this will depend on their ratification processes. A number of them have to hold referenda. Assuming the results are all positive, the intention is that they will participate fully in 2004. That was one of the points we made during the debate on the referendum. It is important that they are not denied their opportunity to do so. As the seats arising in the case of Bulgaria and Romania will not be filled in the elections in 2004, there will be a redistribution, under the terms of which we will have 13 rather than 12 seats.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Will they be allocated among the existing constituencies or is it intended that a decision will be taken on a common form of election?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I do not think there will be a common form of election before 2004. The issue will obviously be decided nationally with regard to the national constituencies for the European Parliament elections in 2004.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I appreciate the Chair's flexibility and the Minister of State's willingness to answer questions. Given what he said in reply to the Second Stage debate, is it possible to amend an EU directive at national level or has it to be dealt with in a European context?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Under the treaties as they are established, the basic differentiation between legal instruments is that a regulation is applicable universally and directly from the time of origin while in regard to a directive, it is the effect that the community wishes to have implemented. It is a matter for each member state to decide on the legal instrument. While there is flexibility with regard to the legal instrument, there is none with regard to the outcome which is required under the terms of the directive. This arrangement was introduced in the original Treaty of Rome, even though the Community of Six was far more homogenous than one of 30. A directive helps to harmonise law in the sense that similar legal statutes come through the various member states, but the choice of instrument to give effect to the wishes of the directive is a matter for the member state concerned. It would be interesting for the Seanad to engage in a debate on this issue.There is an interesting debate on the issue of legal instruments within the Convention on the Future of Europe. There is a debate on the matters under the different pillars and the different approaches which I outlined and to which Senator Ormonde referred. There is also a debate on the numerous different instruments which exist. Part of the ongoing process is to simplify how Europe touches on these issues. It is not as simple as it seems because in trying to move from one process to another significant issues will be raised. In referring to the European Charter Senator McDowell said that while everybody would aspire to its objectives and principles, how it was done was an issue that would have some impact. I hope I have answered his question. It is an issue that arises and if the Seanad is interested in dealing with such issues in the near future, we could, fruitfully, spend some time on them.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thank Senators for the expeditious manner in which they dealt with this technical legislation. I am immensely proud of the work of the people last month in wiping way the last vestiges of the divisions that separated the peoples and countries of Europe for 50 years. It is hard for us to measure the importance of the work we have done and how highly the Irish are regarded. Many of the incoming states and most of our fellow member states recognise the decision made last month by the people as an unique and generous act of solidarity by a small state towards other states with which we have much in common.The expeditious manner in which the Seanad has dealt with the Bill moves the process forward. Once the legislation comes into effect we will move on to full and final ratification. We will have the deposit of the instrument relating to the Treaty of Nice and the way will then be open for enlargement. That will be an historic step and one that would not have been possible without the wisdom and generosity of the people of this nation.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I thank the Minister of State for his generosity in recognising this House as a suitable forum in which to initiate efforts to give the people greater ownership for our participation in Europe. It is important that he recognises, as indicated, some mechanism whereby the views of those who voted "No" for legitimate reasons can be addressed in a forthright way, I hope in this House. In debating the various items the Minister of State has willingly acceded to such a debate for which I hope he will be present in the House.There are practical issues that need to be dealt with. I regret to say that officials in various Departments have an attitudinal problem regarding the transfer of funds from Europe and the acquisition of those funds by people who are legitimately entitled to them. They are labelled, not singularly but globally, in a manner that is damaging to the whole concept of Europe.

He has a good grasp of a subject that is difficult to assimilate in one's mind. The Minister knows where he is going and it is full steam ahead regarding the debate on the future of Europe.I am glad the Minister has noted the points made on all sides of the House about how best we can overcome the remaining problems in this area and how best we can use this Chamber as a means of linking-in with the public on this very important issue.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I am happy to be associated with the expression of thanks to the Minister. I said earlier that we had one major lesson to learn from the most recent referendum campaign and the experience of last year – the people and their support cannot be taken for granted. That is right. It also shows that there is room for idealism. I have always believed, as I have said a number of times in this House and elsewhere, that the major project of our generation is to ensure the war and divisions in equality and poverty which characterised the last century do not characterise this one. When those arguments are powerfully and cogently made, more than enough people are willing to give it a good audience and vote accordingly by endorsing the project.This is another one of those nuts and bolts days where we make our little contribution towards that greater project.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your welcome and thank the House for the invitation to speak on Northern Ireland in what is a interesting time in its development. This is the eve of the commencement of the round table session in the North. On Friday, the British-Irish Council will meet in Scotland and next Tuesday sees the first meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for several years.I welcome this opportunity to address this House on my first visit to the newly elected Seanad. I offer Senators of all parties and of none my best wishes for the life of this Seanad. The Government is very appreciative of the support of the Seanad for the Good Friday Agreement. I recall being in the House, in the days after the Agreement was signed, when the necessary legislation was brought through the House. I will ask the Seanad again next week to pass legislation with regard to the North-South Implementation Bodies so that they can continue to function after 1 December. I am very grateful to Senators for affording me this opportunity to speak about recent developments.The conflict in Northern Ireland over 25 to 30 years claimed over 3,000 lives. Thousands more people were injured and maimed and this has left a terrible legacy of bitterness and distrust. Through the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have the opportunity to go beyond conflict, to overcome that destructive legacy and to embrace the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis for relationships on this island. This is what we have done and will continue to do.While the institutions are currently suspended, the Agreement itself is not. Both Governments are committed during this period of suspension to working the Agreement in areas where it is possible to do so. For example, later this week, I will attend a meeting of the British-Irish Council which is to be held in Scotland and which will go ahead as planned. The council meeting would obviously have benefited greatly from the participation of Northern Ireland Ministers as heretofore. However, it is important that it should continue do its work pending the re-establishment of devolved government.The successful negotiation of the Agreement was achieved because it was an inclusive process and because it addressed all of the key issues of concern. There would not have been an agreement if all of the traditions on this island had not been represented and if the fundamental issues that had given rise to the conflict had not been addressed. The people of Ireland, North and South, ratified the Agreement in referenda. Our authority and our determination to implement the Agreement derive from the clearly expressed vote in favour on referendum day, 96% to 4% against.With the coming into effect of the British-Irish Agreement in December 1999, almost three years ago, the constitutional changes provided for in the Good Friday Agreement came into force and the principle of consent was enshrined in our Constitution. By affirming the consent principle as the basis for constitutional change in the future and by ratifying generous and inclusive reformulated Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the people sent a clear message that they respect all of the traditions on the island and that they want all of the people on the island to live in peace and on the basis of an honourable accommodation. The Government has been a fair and reasonable partner in the process of seeking to implement all aspects of the Agreement and it is our priority to continue to work on this basis with all the parties to achieve this end.The implementation of the Agreement has been incremental and difficult at times. Unionists have found it hard to accept the provisions on prisoner releases and on policing, and many have found it hard to participate in government with Sinn Féin. Nationalists and republicans have embraced the new institutions but have found the approach of Unionists towards those institutions deeply frustrating. However, even if we are now faced with yet another considerable challenge, we have managed the process with some success to date. This is because there is almost universal support for devolved government in Northern Ireland and recognition that the Agreement, despite the misgivings of some Unionists, contains the essential elements for peace and stability in Northern Ireland and represents a fair accommodation between the two communities.Following discussions at Weston Park in the summer of last year, the two Governments published a comprehensive set of proposals in August 2001 designed to address the key outstanding issues at that time – policing, the decommissioning of paramilitary arms, the normalisation of security arrangements and the stability of the institutions being the main points of focus. Since then, considerable progress has been made on policing and significant structural change is in place.The Policing Board has had to deal with a number of complex and sensitive issues and has done so with insight and wisdom, and far better than anyone believed it could. It has dealt successfully with the issues of emblems, the change of the Chief Constable and many other difficult issues. Recruitment from both communities is proceeding successfully. A new Chief Constable has been appointed and has made a positive start, and North-South co-operation on policing is being advanced. Further policing legislation is to be introduced by the British Government in the coming week, which will be closely watched by Unionists and Nationalists alike.Policing has been a touchstone issue. I have said many times that getting policing in communities right has never been more important and is fundamental to getting everything to work. This is particularly evident in the context of the difficulties at interface areas and the problems seen in this and past summers.The participation of representatives of all communities in the new policing arrangements is vital. Participation by Sinn Féin on the Policing Board is important and we would welcome and encourage it. If the police service can be fully accepted and supported by all of the political representatives of both communities, this will make a vital difference and will help greatly in creating confidence that the divisions of the past are being dealt with and healed.While the recent withdrawal by the IRA representative from contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was disappointing, the process of arms decommissioning has been substantially advanced with two acts confirmed by the international commission. Unfortunately, the acts of decommissioning by the IRA were not matched by moves by loyalist paramilitary organisations. Moreover, the response of some Unionists at the time was less than generous and did not take full account of the significance of these historic developments. These events were significant and difficult, and credit must be given where it is due. To move on that issue and to achieve two rounds of decommissioning, described by General John de Chastelain as significant, was a major achievement which should be acknowledged as such.Mr. Gerry Adams said recently that the issue of armed groups needs to be dealt with and that this includes the IRA. While no single issue can resolve the current impasse, there is no doubt that this is a key to overcoming the problem created by the lack of confidence and trust. I believe that Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness are determined to work towards resolving outstanding issues and committed to the democratic path as the only way to achieve political objectives.There has been an enormous improvement in the security situation in Northern Ireland in recent years. We will continue to work with the British Government through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to encourage the greatest levels of demilitarisation possible. In the context of addressing the current impasse, the question of ensuring real progress on demilitarisation will be an obvious priority. People need to see that demilitarisation is taking place and that the process of normalisation is moving forward.In the aftermath of the Agreement coming into effect, it took a considerable time before all the institutional arrangements began to operate effectively. Once the institutions were up and running, however, Ministers in the Executive demonstrated a high degree of commitment to their portfolios, and that has been widely acknowledged. The Assembly and its committees worked well and, with suspension, there was a genuine sense of loss among all members of the Assembly. The experience of devolved Government clearly demonstrated that Northern Ireland is well served by able politicians who can work effectively together for the benefit of all the people. Devolved Government has been good for Northern Ireland. Locally elected, accountable politicians have taken important decisions.The North-South arrangements have worked in a non-threatening way for the benefit of everyone on this island. Ministers from both parts of the island have been meeting regularly with no adverse comment because they have been taking decisions that benefit all the people. The North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council have adopted programmes of work which have brought and will continue to bring benefits to everyone.In the next week the two Governments will take steps to ensure that the necessary public function performed by the various implementation bodies under the North-South Ministerial Council can be continued during the period of suspension. I hope the Seanad will deal with that legislation next week.I acknowledge the positive moves made in recent months by Sinn Féin and the republican movement to address the wrongs of the past and recognise events that are important for unionism. The apology for Bloody Friday was welcome, and the recognition of the importance of Remembrance Day and the sacrifice of Irish soldiers in the British army in the First World War was a gesture of real significance by the republican movement.However, there is no doubt that confidence in the process, especially in recent months, has been undermined. While court proceedings are pending in a number of cases, and I do not want to say anything that might affect those proceedings and the rights of individuals to due process, there is no doubt that a number of issues, including Colombia and allegations about an intelligence-gathering operation in Stormont, have had a debilitating effect. Recent punishment attacks attributed to the IRA have also affected confidence.The activities of loyalist paramilitaries over a long period, but especially over the course of the summer, have also been a cause of deep concern. Interface tensions and violence have been at a heightened level. There is no denying it was a difficult summer. The people of the Short Strand and Larne, and Nationalists living in many other areas throughout Northern Ireland have had to live with terrible, prolonged and consistent sectarian attacks. Recent attacks have been especially appalling. Senators will be well aware of those from the national media.There is a diminishing tolerance of the last vestiges of paramilitarism, especially when it involves the type of internecine feuding and plainly criminal activity we have seen in many respects in recent times. I offer my full support to the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, in his determination to apply the full rigour of the law to those pursuing their own destructive agenda, and I commend the recent successes of the police service in this area which have been brave and useful to the process.Serious issues of trust and confidence remain to be addressed on all sides. We have to be sure that the transition to democratic and peaceful means is being completed. In that context, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has given his commitment to implement the rest of the Agreement, including normalisation in its entirety and not in stages but together. He is also prepared to protect the institutions against arbitrary interruption and interference.It is a major concern of Nationalists that, regardless of what we can achieve in brokering in this round of discussions, if they were to sign up and obtain agreement, would another Saturday morning meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council not bring it all down again because someone's nose was out of joint about some issue not directly part of the process? That continues to concern us.We share the view that now is the time to try to bring finality and certainty. Otherwise the process will be damaged. The prize is great – a completely transformed Northern Ireland with stable, functioning democratic institutions, a system of policing acceptable to all with the participation of all communities, normal security arrangements in communities and an end to paramilitarism. If we succeed in achieving that transformation, and I believe we will, we will then be in a position where all parties will have taken huge steps and huge risks and we will be able to move forward.I pay tribute to the work of the SDLP and Mark Durkan for the vision and leadership they have shown throughout this process. Much of what has been achieved has been due to the remarkable tenacity they have shown in the face of adversity. All parties have benefited from their foresight down the years.Recently I announced that, following consultations with the participating parties and groups, it has been decided to reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation this day week as part of wider efforts directed at building confidence and promoting the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is hoped that the meeting will be useful and will give an opportunity to Members of the Oireachtas and of other parties, North and South, to air their views, some of which are represented in the House and some not. It will be a useful occasion for people to air their views on what has happened during the year.The meeting will conduct a general stocktaking and review of the political situation and developments in Northern Ireland and of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. This will be complementary to other discussions and talks with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties and will provide an opportunity for parties at the forum to air their views.The Government is extremely appreciative of the contribution made to the forum by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, reflecting the views of successive Governments in the past eight years, as well as all the political parties and groups participating in the forum. Her commitment, independence and impartiality were the foundation of the excellent reputation achieved by the forum and its work when it was previously active.I thank Senator Maurice Hayes for agreeing to act as chairman of the forum.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	229	There was unanimous agreement to this in the consultations with the participating parties and groups, reflecting the universal respect for the effectiveness, independence and commitment shown by Senator Hayes in his role as chairman of the National Forum on Europe since October 2001. That forum is ongoing.On 14 October both Governments issued a joint statement expressing our disappointment at the suspension of the Assembly. The Government regrets that the devolved Government had to be suspended. At the same time we made it clear that the exclusion of Sinn Féin from the Executive, as some had sought, was not something we would support.The joint statement was a clear expression of our commitment to the Agreement and to its full implementation. In the period since suspension, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I have been working closely with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the former Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, his successor, Paul Murphy, and the parties to crystallise the issues and chart a way forward. I pay tribute to the work of Dr. Reid and again wish Paul Murphy well in his new role.The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met on 22 October under the joint chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State, Dr. Reid. The conference reviewed political developments and expressed the determination of both Governments to implement the Agreement and to work to achieve the restoration of the devolved institutions.Both I and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, have engaged in bilateral discussions with the parties, and tomorrow the Secretary of State and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will co-chair multi-party talks in Belfast. Both Governments have listened with great care to what the parties have had to say, and there is a clear understanding that we have to work together to overcome the difficult challenges that lie ahead.The issues are clear. They centre on the questions of trust and confidence. As always in Northern Ireland, there is work to be done on all sides. As in the past, the Government will be an active and constructive partner in the process. It would be wrong for all parties who are committed to the Agreement not to dedicate themselves fully to meeting the challenges that lie ahead.A core strength has been the partnership between both Governments. We have demonstrated in recent weeks that we are determined to work closely together as we have always done at all critical stages in the process. This will be very important in the weeks and months ahead.The Agreement is the template. It represents a profound charter for change, embedding equality in all aspects of life in Northern Ireland. Its fundamental principles and values are the only basis for moving forward. There can be no turning back. Four and a half years on, the Agreement has transformed Northern Ireland. Our task is to ensure that the transition to a peaceful, locally accountable, democratic society is complete.I thank the Seanad for its support on matters concerning Northern Ireland at all times over the last five to six years. I have always looked forward to keeping it updated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I will be happy to keep it informed of developments as we move through the present series of discussions before and after Christmas.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	230	On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome the Taoiseach to the Seanad and commend and thank him for his remarks today. It is significant that he chose to make these remarks, particularly at this difficult time for the peace process when we move forward with hope to the new round of talks that will start tomorrow.It is right, as the Taoiseach said, that other parts of the Agreement should continue, specifically the North-South dimension. Next week Fine Gael will facilitate the swift passage of emergency legislation to ensure the North-South Ministerial Council and the Implementation Bodies can continue their work. It is important, too, that the British-Irish Council can continue its work because it would send a positive signal in terms of east-west relations.I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to Senator Maurice Hayes on his appointment as chairman of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. It is an honour for the House that he was chosen for the role. I commend him for his work and look forward to working with him. I also congratulate the Senators newly appointed to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body which will meet in Manchester over the coming weekend and early next week.Both Governments face a difficult task in putting the process back together. They are attempting to use their offices and authority and the mandate or template of the Agreement to ensure it works again. All of us have an obligation to support both Governments in this important work. Fine Gael will continue to support all strands of the process in a beneficial way.It is now decision time for the parties at the centre of the peace process, Nationalists, republicans and Unionists – the pro-Agreement parties. They must decide whether they want to make the Agreement work. Ultimately, the decision is theirs and it does not really matter what persuasion comes from Westminster or Dublin.The two issues that must be addressed for confidence to be restored in Northern Ireland and the Republic are ones that have bedevilled the process since it was initiated. They are the issue of illegally held arms and that of the continuation of paramilitary parties. It is essential these issues are dealt with once and for all. It has been only at part of the process where there has been a dilemma on these issues that progress has been made. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to keep this in mind.A month ago I said in the House that the State entered a kind of political limbo when it first started discussions with republicans ten years ago. As we know, the British started discussions 30 years ago, but those discussions were secret. The State only started discussions in the early 1990s and we expected an outcome. We expected that the same principles that apply to the normal political parties we have grown to know, love and hate in the State would apply in Northern Ireland.These two issues must be addressed. That would give confidence to the process and those who work within it. I ask the Taoiseach to go forward with that message. I want Sinn Féin to play its part in normal democratic politics, but a normal political party is not engaged in the kind of activities in which Sinn Féin is involved. I speak for Members on both sides of the House who know the activities to which I refer. We want to see an end to them forever. The self-determination of the people as expressed in support of the Good Friday Agreement demands that it be the centre of our work over the coming months.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I welcome the Taoiseach. We are honoured. The House appreciates his visit. A month ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, visited the House when we had an excellent debate on Northern Ireland.It is good that the two Governments have tried to fill the vacuum and that despite the suspension they continue to work together. The publicity given to the various meetings that have been held, the continuation of activity, North and South, and the continuation of interest from London have given the message that there is not an impasse. The Good Friday Agreement, as the Taoiseach said, remains intact. The effort now is to see that the hopes and dreams that dawned on that day come to fruition.When we think of the 3,000 people who have died, the maimings, the bitterness and the loss of trust and confidence, we realise how daunting it is for those with responsibility for the various bodies to ensure the continuation of trust and confidence. Three times the Taoiseach gave voice to the need to rebuild that sense of trust and confidence. These two qualities are needed in abundance if we are to pick up the threads and chart the way forward. The Taoiseach has been clear in what he has said. It is amazing how the issues leap out at us, particularly the issue of trust and confidence.It is also evident that there have been changes over the four years. Some have been greater than others. At times it has been a step forwards and at others a step sideways, but the welcome changes have been incremental in nature. There is a determination now to clear the decks and address the outstanding issues. I hope it will come to fruition.I often wonder how the principals in the process keep going and how they can face the next day when they have met an impasse, an upset or a particularly difficult situation. If something does not work out, they just accept it and decide to get together again to see what they can do to bridge the gap. Many gaps have been bridged and great steps forward taken. The huge vote, North and South, which copperfastened the Good Friday Agreement showed that, deep down, everybody wanted peace, stability and democratic progress, the principles people want to see enshrined in the North.Great strides have been made. People have got used to normal government, to having a Minister for Agriculture, Education or the Environment going about his or her duties as part of normal political life. We take this for granted, but it was unheard of in Northern Ireland. Deep down, people now have a strong belief that they can manage matters and can get along. There is no reason this should not continue. The principle outlined by the Taoiseach of taking giant steps forward as distinct from incremental ones is a fine policy. My wish is that this can be done.I join in the praise given by Senator Brian Hayes to Senator Maurice Hayes. We are very proud to have the Senator with us actively participating in the business of the House. It is a great mark of honour for the Seanad. We wish all participants good luck. We ourselves will participate in some of the organisations and bodies. We will be watching closely and, as the Taoiseach has said, we hope that we will be able to take that giant step forward.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	232	With the permission of the House and in order to get in as many speakers as possible, I would like to share my time with Senator Norris. I promise I will sit down as soon as the Chair indicates the two and a half minutes are over. Since it was a few minutes after 5 o'clock when we started, there should be a little tolerance at the other end.I concur with much that has been said. I welcome the Taoiseach and affirm the work of Senator Maurice Hayes. The work being done by all sides has to be acknowledged. I want to make two simple points, one macro and one micro. The micro point derives from our extraordinary and impossible cultural legacy of animosity, hatred and division which seem to be endemic in this island but which other countries have left behind. I look with envy at Europe and see countries whose peoples were killing each other by the thousands half a century ago and can now sit around the table, do business and share political power and authority. We have never managed to do this as a State. This is because of all of us. It is not Unionists, republicans, Nationalists, Catholics or Protestants; it just seems to be endemic. I have the pessimistic view that it will take generations for us to work through that. It is essential that we do.On the micro level, the process could be helped enormously by a vote of confidence in the PSNI. I plead with Sinn Féin to take its place on the Northern Ireland Policing Board to give the board credibility. People working for the PSNI have to go out night after night to try to maintain peace and what is right in the community. They deserve the support of us all.The macro point is this. In support of what Senator Brian Hayes said, the thinking has to stop whereby parties in Northern Ireland feel able to let the thing fall apart in the hope that the Dublin and London Governments will put it all together and they can all get back on track. We are sick and tired of it. I ask the Taoiseach to use his negotiating skills to exert pressure in both directions. He should pressurise one with the threat of direct rule and the other with the threat of Dublin interference. Let them see that is the way it is going to be until they get their act together. The solution has to be among those in the North.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I also welcome the Taoiseach, particularly because he is known as a good and humane negotiator. That is why I am so devastated by his speech and so utterly disappointed in it. I have to say that.I hope the Taoiseach did not write his script. I have some tradition in language. In his speech there is praise for the SDLP. There is praise for Sinn Féin. There is praise for the IRA. I did not say Sinn Féin/IRA – I said praise for both of them separately. It contains legitimate and proper criticism and attack on the bestial attacks by loyalist paramilitaries, but there is not one single crumb of commendation in the entire speech for any strand of unionism. That seems to reflect a narrow tribalism that I deplore. It is regrettable. If I were a Northern Unionist, I would be out that door. It is a great pity and a missed opportunity. I hope this event is not recorded for transmission in the North of Ireland.The Taoiseach referred to the British-Irish Agreement which, if it were proposed now, the Unionists would throw out, because there has been this single-minded attitude towards it. He referred to the difficulties of Unionists participating in government with Sinn Féin/IRA. His own Government said it would not do so until Sinn Féin got rid of its army.I ask the Taoiseach to get some of his officials to look at a recording of the "Spotlight" programme broadcast last night. It looked at the Claudy bombing and was one of the most devastatingly brilliant programmes I have seen. Let us have a commitment to truth and reconciliation, because until we have real truth and real reconciliation, we will not go anywhere. We must bear in mind the sympathies and feelings of those unfortunate people on both sides of the community who were deliberately blown to pieces by the IRA. They have always tried to get away with it. It was noticeable that when Martin McGuinness, who was praised in the Taoiseach's speech, was asked for an interview, he refused. He issued a statement saying he knew nothing about it. We all know what his position was in the North of Ireland at that point.I regret to say I was really disappointed with the Taoiseach's speech. In future can he please let us have something more even handed? Let us have some recognition of the work done by David Trimble in very difficult circumstances. Let us not just play to our own little audience here and let us look at things such as setting up a truth and reconciliation commission.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I too welcome the Taoiseach. I congratulate him and his Government colleagues on their efforts to date in the peace process. I wish him well in the crucial months ahead. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I congratulate Senator Maurice Hayes on his appointment and I wish him well.The Good Friday Agreement was a milestone for this country in the search for peace. There is equally no doubt that if we were to renegotiate such an agreement now we would not get as good an agreement. The creation of a vacuum by the recent breakdown plays into the hands of extremists on both sides. That serves no one, nor does it serve the peace process or the future of Northern Ireland or this country. It does not serve them well if extremists are seen to benefit. We are so tantalisingly close to reaching peace on this island that there is an onus on us all to row in behind the efforts to bring things back on track. The loss of momentum can lead us down the slippery slope and return to atrocities and activities that we do not want to see on this island again.Decommissioning will continue to be an issue until it is embraced. We must stop walking on eggshells around this issue. We must stand up and be counted on it. The events on 11 September 2001 have put terrorism in the world on a new footing. It is not acceptable to have double standards when we allow people to trade in international terror. We cannot say enough about it.We must clearly separate democracy and paramilitary activities. I have no hesitation in condemning paramilitary activities on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland. It is not acceptable. Punishment beatings, racketeering and criminal activities in the name of a so-called cause are not acceptable. For once and for all we must put this to bed. If we want to have credibility as a State and as a people, we must stand up and be counted on this. There is no more room for this type of activity.In this country we have a recognised democratic system that supports the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces. That is what we recognise.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Taoiseach agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé fíorfáilte roimh pé tacaíocht gur féidir linn a thabhairt dó sna cainteanna a bheidh ag tosnú. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Maurice Hayes, whom I am sure will be a distinguished and excellent chairman. As my remarks will, of necessity, be brief, some nuances may be missing. The last time I spoke on Northern Ireland I mentioned the ambiguities that surround Sinn Féin in the South, to which it took great exception. I was approached and told I had been regarded as impartial on these issues and that my speech was a departure from that impartiality. I suspect I will have more approaches after my speech tonight.When I was an independent Senator in the 1980s, I stuck my neck out because I believed that excluding an entire section of a community was not the solution. I, therefore, met people from Sinn Féin both here and in Belfast, Aughnacloy and other places. On each occasion I accepted their position on human rights and prisoners because it was right to do so, but I also told them – in dodgy places like pubs in west Belfast – that even if their catalogue of complaints was the entire sum of what had happened in Northern Ireland, the killing of a human being was not justified by it. That was my position then as now.At this stage Sinn Féin is moving into a different phase of its existence and must convince us it has made up its mind. I am tired of stories which are not explained but kept at arm's length, including one in my constituency where a prominent Sinn Féin activist was convicted having been found in a car with paramilitary clothing and weapons. We are entitled to know what is going on. This is the best organised, most disciplined and best funded political party on the island and that it continues to deny knowledge of any of these stories stretches credulity.I agree with Senator Norris, to a degree, that unionism seems to be struggling, but the single biggest compromise made in the Good Friday Agreement – there were many – was the willingness of the Ulster Unionist Party to share government with the political party which had made no secret of its connection with a paramilitary organisation which had killed large numbers of members of Northern Ireland's security forces. That compromise was made because of the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement which, it was understood, would precipitously lead to the decoupling of the political party in question from paramilitarism. Unionism is entitled to expect that decoupling will happen.I am not talking about silly things like the IRA deciding not to exist – there are many ways of doing this – but in the short term it should explain or end the series of ambiguous activities that have included the shootings of a chip shop operator in south Armagh and a police officer in Derry and many others. We are entitled to this, but we are also entitled to considerable care in the language of unionism. Some of the remarks of the Ulster Unionist leader who, while he deserves great praise for many of the things he has done and his willingness to take political risks, seems to have a capacity to look down on other states – this one in particular – do nothing for his credibility. I do not take them seriously, but he will not win over opinion in this State towards understanding their difficulties by using such language.If we are to have the influence we should have as a state, we must enjoy equivalent credibility with the population in Northern Ireland. If 100 members of the PSNI refused to co-operate with an official body investigating misbehaviour, the Government would be in a state of apoplexy about it. It must establish its own credibility in the areas of human rights, police reform and a belief that, rather than a basket case economy, we have an economy that can maintain the levels of prosperity we have enjoyed. That is what credibility is about and what we need. I suggest these three elements need to be advanced if we are to get the process back on track.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I reiterate the warm welcome to the Taoiseach and the honour he has brought on this House by coming before us. I am sure he will agree that there are few crumbs of comfort as we approach the end of the year in relation to Northern Ireland and North-South relations. The one glowing light is the good and improving relations between Britain and Ireland.I must take issue with my friend and colleague, Senator Norris, who uses the words "leadership" and "Mr. Trimble" in the same sentence. What leadership was displayed by walking away from a working executive in which the devolved institutions were working well with politicians from all sides co-operating? Direct rule has replaced the Executive and the SDLP has set up a monitoring mechanism to ensure people are given their democratic rights.The decision to leave the Executive was made by a party, 25% of which is made up of members of the Orange Order – basically, a sectarian organisation. If we had a similar input into our political fora in the Republic, for example, if the Catholic Church had 200 members on a council with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or the Progressive Democrats, we would never hear the end of it. In the last six months the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has made gratuitous and offensive remarks about this State – most recently in Chicago. We have a justifiable and inalienable right to exist as a nation; we are a mother country, yet a Unionist leader who says he wishes to reach out resorts to these remarks despite his claims that he was quoted out of context. Any reading of what he said, as reported, indicates there is still a deep-seated sectarian attitude within unionism in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach made a point that most Unionists support power-sharing, but I am sorry to have to say this, that, I respectfully suggest, flies in the face of recent surveys which depressingly show that a majority of Protestant opinion in the North does not wish to share power with its Catholic neighbours. That is the level at which we are operating.I reiterate the comments made about the Taoiseach's and the Government's commitment since 1997. I echo the Leader's query as to where the Taoiseach finds the energy and commitment with all the other responsibilities and obligations of a Taoiseach in the Republic. Despite the deep gulf between unionism and nationalism on the island, there is a need for us to get to know one another better. This may be done through better school exchanges, more media coverage, extension of RTÉ radio and television coverage into Northern Ireland or some other initiative in order that the next generation – Protestant, Catholic, Nationalist or Unionist – will have an understanding of each other's cultures, political rights and their right to exist. I hope this can come out of the political process.I wish the Taoiseach and the Government all one can in hoping that, going into the New Year, the Executive will be revived, that we will not face an uncertain future with the two extremes of Sinn Féin and the DUP on opposite sides of the electoral divide and that there will be an encouragement to the middle ground with the result that it holds on both sides.

I also thank him for his interest and thoughtfulness on the subject. I am delighted to learn that we are on the eve of round table talks. There is no alternative to ongoing dialogue between all the parties involved and both Governments. I am delighted our colleague, Senator Maurice Hayes, is to be chairman of the reconvened Forum for Peace and Reconciliation on which I congratulate him.Peace requires the end of all paramilitarism. The present impasse is difficult, but not new; there have been previous suspensions. A political vacuum is not good, it is positively dangerous. The two Governments are the guarantors and must continue to act properly and prudently, as they are doing. The process requires ongoing determination and tenacity, qualities which both Governments are demonstrating. Implementation of all outstanding measures is most important. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments in that regard. We must focus on this objective rather than apportioning blame.The Taoiseach has rightly said we must not roll back the progress made following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The British Government has stated very firmly that it wants to implement the Agreement. In stating unequivocally that he will not renegotiate the Agreement Mr. Blair is very much in line with the position which the Taoiseach has outlined. It is very satisfactory that they can work so well together.We agree with the position of the two Governments. That, after all, is what the people voted for, North and South. Progress on decommissioning and demilitarisation is essential. A south Armagh in which watch towers and British troops proliferate must become a thing of the past. Policing remains a hugely important issue in respect of which we also need full implementation. I was encouraged by the Taoiseach's statement that further policing legislation is to be introduced next week and that recruitment from both communities in the North is proceeding satisfactorily.I hope the leadership on both sides, Unionist and Nationalist, will have steely nerves to ensure the further transition to full democratic engagement and final and total abandonment of all past failed policies. They have already shown that, despite disagreements and reluctance, they are capable of conflict resolution. A degree of inclusiveness has been displayed. It is imperative to get the process back on track as speedily as possible. If it is to be anchored, as it must be, it needs the stability of the Executive and the other bodies.Full participation in all the talks is the best guarantee Unionists have of the outcome they and the rest of us so badly want, namely, permanent peace. We also recognise the difficulties of Sinn Féin, but, since it is in politics and, through its leadership, has demonstrated this in a most committed way, it no longer needs anyone in the background with guns or semtex. Power sharing is vital for confidence and the further nurturing of the process. I fully endorse the Taoiseach's comments and wish him and the British Government well, together with all the parties.

Ní gá domsa a rá go bhfuilimíd thar a bheith mórálach as an obair foighneach, stuama, misniúil atá déanta aige ar ár son le roinnt blian anuas. It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Taoiseach. I have no doubt he will go down as one of the great leaders of this nation on account of the magnanimity he has shown and his endeavours at all times to understand both traditions on the island by working in a very focused way to leave behind us history and all that it entails. Once the Good Friday Agreement was signed, we also left behind us the weighing scales syndrome of blame, to which it would not behove us to return.A few months ago a delegation from the Orange tradition travelled south to have discussions with me. They said they were particularly worried for their own traditions because, during the 30 years of the troubles, young people of the Orange Order and their supporters did not embrace their traditions. On the Nationalist side, however, young people seemed to be much more proactive with regard to their traditions. If it is possible for us at this stage to talk about Orange traditions being decimated or sidelined, we should also be generous in listening and trying to see if we can be magnanimous in that regard.It gives me great hope that the sovereign Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic can trust each other, as is now the case. No wedge should be driven where that trust is concerned. Anybody who provokes a return to where we have come from will not be thanked by any future generation. Reference has been made to people sitting down with Sinn Féin despite that party's background. It is also noteworthy that republicans sat down with those who had worked very closely with the B-Specials, the partisan police force of the RUC and the clandestine operations of the British Army. Any return to apportioning blame would be totally negative and unproductive.I hope the upcoming elections in the North will not result in the different traditions looking over their shoulders at their respective supporters, as I believe Mr. Trimble did in his comments about the Republic. Stepping out of line in that way is not helpful. A letter writer to one of the daily newspapers commented that if Mr. Trimble had referred in similar fashion to Israel, he would have provoked an international outcry. Why should he make such statements about this country, having regard to our very proactive endeavours to achieve a lasting solution on the island?All political parties right across the board deserve credit for the peace process, both in the Republic and the North of Ireland. The greatest contribution we can make is to ensure we do not in any way fragment the cohesive approach we have had and cultivate it at every opportunity. It is my hope that, in 2003, peace will be firmly and totally established on the island and that justice will no longer be tempered by political expediency.

Anybody who has had to go through that experience would be very careful about the words they use and actions they take. This has happened on all sides in the intervening 30 years. With the Agreement, we saw some chance. I noted the Taoiseach's comment that it took some time before all of the institutional arrangements began to operate effectively as they did. Now they have slipped – I hope it is only a slip. Shame on us as a nation, a 32 county island, if we allow what has been achieved to fall apart. Let us be very careful on all sides about the words we use and the actions we take. Let us support those who are working towards peace by giving them our full commitment. The Taoiseach and others leading the process deserve out best support.

Having read the Taoiseach's speech, while I supported a great deal of what he did for many years – his consistency and lack of one-sidedness – I have to say this is the most one-sided speech I have heard in this House from a Taoiseach. It is most disappointing. I do not know who wrote it for him. I do not believe his scriptwriters in the past would have produced anything so one-sided.I want to go through the speech in my two minutes, echo what Senator Norris said and be a bit more specific. There is not a single sentence which holds out the hand of friendship to the Unionists. There is not a single sentence of condemnation of Sinn Féin or the IRA. That is quite extraordinary in the present circumstances, where the Unionist people in Northern Ireland have taken what they believe is kick after kick in the stomach from the IRA. Let there be no doubt that the IRA is active.If his speech is read in Northern Ireland the Taoiseach will cause immense disappointment. He talks about the approaches to Unionists being frustrated. He goes on to say that devolved government, despite the misgivings of Unionists, will work. That is pejorative. He talks about the IRA's withdrawal from the independent commission on arms as being "disappointing" and then praises them. "The IRA's acts of decommissioning unfortunately," he says "were not matched." These great men are responsible for the deaths of 3,000 people – it is more actually – and unfortunately their acts were not matched. Their decommissioning was not matched. Will the Cathaoirleach let me finish?

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I move:That Seanad Éireann condemns the decision of this Government to abolish the first-time buyer's grant, in the light of the crisis in housing affordability and the continuing increase in housing waiting lists, and supports the call by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to restore the grant forthwith.The elimination of the grant is first and foremost a devastating blow to the aspirations, still held dear by so many people, of owning their own house. It means that thousands of people who had thought they were in a position to buy a house will either not be able to do so for the foreseeable future or, in some extreme cases, may not be able to do so at all. In doing what it did, in the way it did it, the Government has sent out a clear and unequivocal message to first-time buyers, particularly young people, that they are on their own and it does not care.The way in which this was defended by the Minister for Finance has particularly stuck in the craw of so many people who were depending on this grant. To say as he did, so casually, that it is only €4,000 anyway, it does not amount to a great deal and was all being pocketed by the builder, demonstrates an insensitivity to the needs of young people which, unfortunately, is typical of him. The fact is that €4,000 is a great deal of money if you do not have a deposit. It is possible that over a period of 20 or 25 years it may add to the price of the house. However, 20 or 25 years is a very long period if your primary concern is with the here and now. It was the here and now which was of primary importance to most people looking to put together the €15,000 or €20,000 that most of them need for a deposit. In that context the €4,000 was extremely important.The Government has argued that because the grant came a few months later it was not actually part of the deposit. That flies in the face of reality. Very many people, not all by any means, trying to put together a deposit borrowed the €4,000 from friends or family or, in some cases, from lending institutions. I am aware of cases where builders agreed to forgo, for a few months, the amount of the grant and took it on assignment when the money came through from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It was a very necessary part of the €20,000, approximately, that people needed to buy the cheapest houses available.The Government has also argued that the grant was introduced as a support for industry and is not needed any longer. To some extent it is right. In the '60s and '70s construction was largely stagnant and the impetus behind the grant, which was introduced by members of Fianna Fáil at the time was to support the building industry and their friends in the construction sector, as they tended to do. It was effective in this. However, over time the grant has become a support for individual purchasers, not for the industry. We must acknowledge this central fact in any debate about the issue.It has also been argued that the grant discriminates between different types of first-time buyers because it only applied to first-time buyers of new houses. I have been making that point, as have others in Opposition, for some years. It has been clear for some time that the industry itself did not need support and the people who did were particular types of purchasers, specifically first-time buyers. I have always argued that first-time buyers of second-hand houses were equally entitled to the grant and that the exemption from stamp duty, which applies to first-time buyers of new houses, should also be applied in respect of second-hand houses. It is the purchaser we should seek to support, not the industry.For a number of years the industry has clearly not needed our support – at least, it should not have needed it. When I did leaving certificate economics, back in the 1970s, I was taught that these matters depended upon supply and demand; if the demand was there for something the industry would supply it. However, for the past three, four or five years there has been a huge demand for houses in every sector and the industry has been incapable of or unwilling to supply it. This is the core of the issue. My party and I believe that the industry and the sector have been manipulated deliberately by builders to ensure that supply does not meet demand. That in turn feeds, deliberately and directly, into the super-normal profits which many in the industry have enjoyed in recent years.The question arises of what the Government's response to this. The Government commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon some years ago. He suggested that it was necessary, in the first instance and at least as a temporary measure, to take investors out of the market, or at least to reverse some of the advantages which they enjoyed. In recent years, the Labour Party supported various measures recommended by Dr. Bacon, such as the abolition of interest relief on borrowings, which was subsequently reversed by the Government. We were in favour of Dr. Bacon's suggestions in relation to capital gains tax and development land, which were ignored by the Government.I have no problem with people who invest in property, for example those who buy houses as an investment for their retirement, as long as they behave as good landlords. The regulations and standards that have been put in place must be upheld. We need a healthy and vibrant rental sector, but the Irish sector is very small by comparison with European norms.We must ensure that first-time buyers are not priced out of the market. The first-time buyer's grant was a paltry but important measure which attempted to redress the balance. The Government's decision to abolish the grant has ensured that the balance we were trying to strike has been undone. Investors, who were already enjoying significant benefits, are now enjoying greater benefits still. In the past, houses in new estates in counties Meath and Kildare were bought off the plans by investors, meaning that young couples with hard-earned deposits found that 80% or 90% of the houses had been sold when they tried to purchase one. I do not doubt that we will soon return to such a situation.Few issues demonstrate the failures of this Government and its immediate predecessor more than housing. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, knows as well as I do that it is simply not possible for young people in the part of Dublin we come from to buy houses there when they leave the family home. If two young people are not earning in excess of €50,000 between them, they will not be able to afford the vast majority of houses in the north-east of the city, including the constituency I used to represent in the other House. In such circumstances, young people are obliged to go to counties Meath, Kildare or Westmeath, or further afield, for a few years at least.What is the Government's policy on housing? The measures recommended by Dr. Bacon were ignored or overturned. The tax on speculation was overturned before it came into existence. Journalists have speculated that part 5 may be revisited. What is the Government's policy in relation to this area? I recall that the Minister of State is on record as supporting part 5, yet we read reports, which have not been contradicted, that the part 5 provisions are to be revisited and may be overturned.What is the Government's policy in relation to development land? Does the Government acknowledge that something needs to be done about development land? The only known Government policy in this area was when, contrary to all recommendations, it reduced the level of capital gains tax on development land from 40% to 20% to encourage speculation rather than do the opposite.The Labour Party has put down this motion to voice its view, as well as to give Government Senators, whether they are members of Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, an opportunity to express their thoughts on this matter. Anybody who has listened to the radio during the last week will have heard many backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies saying that the proposal to abolish the first-time buyer's grant is appalling and awful. Five minutes after they said they were personally opposed to the idea, they made clear that they will vote with the Government nevertheless. I have personal experience of voting against a Government as a Government backbencher and Fianna Fáil Deputies have done likewise in the past. It is possible not to support the Government when one is a representative of a Government party; there is life after doing so, just about. It is possible to hold a conviction strongly enough to give it due expression by opposing it in the lobbies of the Oireachtas. I hope some Government Senators will have sufficient strength of conviction to vote with the Opposition tonight, rather than simply voicing their hostility to the measure in front of the electorate. Government backbenchers have to put up or shut up as regards the first-time buyer's grant.The abolition of the grant will directly affect thousands of people. Many similarly damaging measures are contained in the fine print of the Estimates, as published last week, and we will have opportunities to discuss such matters in the coming months. The question for this evening in this House and the other House is whether Government Senators and Deputies are willing to stand over the measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the way in which they were introduced.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	256	It is with great pleasure that I second this motion on behalf of the Labour Party. As Senator McDowell has outlined, this motion has been put down tonight because the decision, announced less than a week ago, that the first-time buyer's grant is to be abolished has proven to be one of the more controversial and contentious of this Government's proposals. The decision is one of a long list of despicable actions, including the cut in medical card eligibility and the capping of rent allowances, which will affect social welfare recipients and those on low wages, and the reintroduction of fees for third level education. I imagine that some of the hidden elements of the Estimates and the proposals to be announced in the forthcoming budget will lead to similar despair. I appeal to the Government to reverse its decision to abolish the first-time buyer's grant, as it is not too late to do so. Perhaps the Government will start to listen to its backbenchers.One of the reasons this proposal has been met with such an outcry is that those affected by it are people who had such high expectations of a share in the economic boom. On this side of the House, we believe the State has a fundamental duty to ensure the basic right to housing of all its citizens is met. This means that housing should be both available and affordable.When the history of the period of economic success is written, it will show that the Government failed to perform its duties in the housing sector. In recent years, we have seen that benefits have been consistently loaded in favour of investors and away from those who need them most – first-time buyers and those struggling to enter the housing market.The price of housing has been allowed to escalate and social housing has not been provided, as evidenced by the increasing numbers of people on local authority housing lists. The increase in the number of homeless people is a sad indictment of a Government that has allowed people who do not need housing, such as investors and their friends, to squeeze out of the market those attempting to put a roof over their heads.The notion that the investor in the market should receive benefits raises all sorts of ideological questions. Those who are investing in property invariably have a home already. The person who does not have a home is forced to compete with the person who does. Where should the priority lie? Where is the greater need? As a society, we should ask these questions and answer them in a particular way. Clearly people who need to purchase a home should be the priority.The first-time buyer's grant was a very clear signal of the Government's policy to assist those attempting to enter the market and to get on to the property ladder in the first instance. Once one gets on to the property ladder, it is easier to move upwards. It is becoming increasingly difficult to do so, a factor which the grant was all about. In discontinuing the grant the Government is taking away the only support available to first-time buyers. However, this is not matched by any lessening of the supports available to investors in the market for whom the current tax reliefs are much greater than the supports available to first-time buyers. It is a very mean-minded gesture which gives a greater benefit to investors and takes it from first-time buyers. It sends a very negative signal in terms of social policy, where our priorities as a society lie and where the Government's priorities lie.Those of us who travel through Kildare to the Oireachtas cannot help noticing the rapid growth of housing estates outside Dublin, as far as Portlaoise and Carlow. Even without a spatial strategy being published by the Government, people have been exercising their choice in the only way they can by buying houses very far away from where they work. The number of people commuting from Carlow, Portlaoise, Mullingar and Tullamore, for example, is increasing at a huge rate. The reason is simple. The crisis in affordability has forced people further away from Dublin and their place of work. This has put increasing pressure on other infrastructure such as roads because increasing numbers of people are forced to travel longer distances every day to work. Lack of housing policy is having a severe effect on other policy elements and how the Government does its work.I appeal to Senators on the Government side of the House to exercise some power in this regard to put pressure on Government Ministers so that they will realise this is a major issue. It is also a major question of social policy. We are all aware that housing has become one of the most difficult issues with which people must deal. We must at an early stage in the lifetime of this Administration send a very clear signal that this simply is not good enough. We can do so by restoring the grant forthwith.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:"recognises the Government's decision in regard to the first-time buyer's new house grant as one of the measures necessary in order to ensure a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure and supports the continued action and commitment by the Government to focus housing expenditure on responding to the needs of low income households and those with special needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives."I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I realise the difficult decisions he and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, had to make in the context of the Estimates, particularly in ensuring a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure. The new house grant was introduced in its current form in 1977 when just 17,000 new private houses were being built each year. I recall it in particular because it was an issue in the general election of that year. Some 25 years later, private housing output exceeds 47,000 units.I welcome the Minister's commitment to social housing, affordable housing and the disabled person's housing grant. However, some clarification is needed in regard to families who have moved into estates or perhaps families who are waiting to move into affordable housing schemes. I refer in particular to families who have not yet signed contracts but whose local authority, in this instance Galway County Council, has contracts signed with the builders. The Minister of State might clarify if people in estates such as Mount Bellew, Tuam, Abbey, Loughrey, including families who are about to move into a scheme in Loughrey, are eligible for the new house grant. I believe they will qualify as the local authority has signed contracts.The main purpose of the new house grant scheme was to encourage new house building. For this reason, as Senator McDowell said, first-time purchasers who bought an existing house did not secure any grant assistance. In order to boost new house building, the grant was set at a high level. Some £1,000 was a high level in 1977. When the grant was first introduced it represented approximately 7% of the average new house price. However, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, the Government is considering carefully every expenditure programme and scheme. The new house grant is obviously of benefit to those who qualify but its economic impact has long since been absorbed in house prices. Its value is now exceeded considerably by the value of the stamp duty exemption for new houses. The Government is proposing to retain this exemption which would amount to €5,900 on the average new house price.In recent years there have been a range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs. Between 1998 and 2001, the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by 35% to 11,385 units. A further increase to almost 13,000 units is forecast for this year.

#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The focus of housing expenditure is, therefore, to respond to the needs of these groups with special housing needs through a range of targeted initiatives. The provision was €38 million for this year.In regard to the grant scheme the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated:Grants have been a contributing factor in pushing up both house and land prices. It is clear now that the construction industry must reflect on today's developments when formulating house prices. Experience has shown that grants for house buyers has returned little benefit to consumers. They have simply been absorbed in the increased profits of builders.The Department of the Environment and Local Government has increased its spending over the past five years. However, it is slightly down in the 2003 Estimate.The Minister stressed that the new house grant scheme was not improving affordability. Many experts such as Colm McCarthy of DKM, Economic Consultants, the NESC and Peter Bacon in the Bacon report commented on this issue. As far back as 1993 the NESC expressed the view that grants are an inefficient and inequitable instrument to tackle housing needs.I welcome in particular what the Minister said on the responsibility of builders. Many of us heard people speak on Marian Finucane's radio programme about the lack of information on the different housing estates. People could not even get information on the dimensions of the rooms in the houses or apartments for sale. This morning I heard the Minister talking about how builders could help if they, for example, furnished or partly furnished new developments.The new house grant scheme goes back to 1977. House prices were low at the time, interest rates were high and tax rates were up to 60%. These factors certainly made grant-aid more meaningful. However, the housing market has changed dramatically since then.The first-time buyer has been pushed out of the market in recent times because of escalating prices. However, Government measures have resulted in increased supply and even house price increases have been stabilised. We must be prudent in these measures. The Government has examined ways of helping people through the affordable housing scheme, but I would like to see those who have paid deposits but not signed a contract being helped. I hope the Minister of State will address this in his reply.I am glad that we have examined ways of helping people. I hope a way will also be found in the forthcoming budget to target help through increased mortgage relief or subsidy. I am confident that the Minister will provide funding for the disabled person's housing grants scheme, which is an excellent scheme, although it urgently needs funding. Schemes for the elderly such as the essential repairs grants scheme and health board schemes should also be funded. This debate should address the exorbitant price of land and I hope we can have a debate on planning at a later stage. It is disgraceful that more land is not released for housing development. I know, as a Senator who represents a rural area, that it would be helpful if young people could build on their parents' land as they would have free sites on which to build homes for themselves.I welcome the total housing expenditure of €1.787 billion for 2003. This is an increase on the 2002 Estimate for housing and shows that the Minister fought his case very well in Cabinet. I compliment him and his Minister of State on the work they are doing and hope they will be able to build on it in the future.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I support the motion and welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern. In the light of the Government's decision to abolish the first-time buyer's grant, I ask the Minister what he is going to do for the many thousands of young people who will lose out on their €3,810 grant despite pre-election promises from the Government that there would be no cutbacks in any area. Lies buy votes, but they certainly do not buy houses. Purchasing a home is a large financial commitment for any person, let alone couples with young families. Many have budgeted for the grant on which they have depended and they have now been left high and dry by this uncaring Government, which has placed extra financial hardship on potential first-time purchasers.Due to the slashing of the grant by the Government, many more young people will be forced to look to their local authorities for housing. Given the numbers – more than 100,000 – on waiting lists at present, the increase in the number of applicants will push an already over-stretched system to the limits, giving the people concerned very little prospect of being housed. Banks limit the amount young people can borrow. They will be forced to look to their hard-pressed parents for support with regard to building homes of their own. For many, the only alternative will be to remain with their families or look to the expensive private rented sector.It is unbelievable and unacceptable that the Minister for Finance should penalise those struggling to acquire their first home, yet retain considerably higher allowances for members of the Government on salaries and other allowances that ordinary people can only dream about. Being privileged politicians, Ministers can claim 100% tax relief on mortgages for their second homes in Dublin and also standard tax relief on their constituency houses. A suggestion which has emerged and which should be implemented by the Minister is that mortgage interest relief be doubled for first-time buyers for the first five years. This is an issue in which the Taoiseach has a moral obligation to intervene, given the many serious and social repercussions attached to it.The Government has put forward a cheap argument that the new house grant was simply absorbed by builders and went as far as to say that the grants contributed to increasing house prices. Rather, retaining housing grants ensures houses are built to a high standard, especially for new owners who may not be up to date with the building regulation standards. I was told this morning that the Department's inspector sent a builder back three times to rectify faults on a certain house before the grants were paid. Will the cowboy builders we had be allowed to creep back into the system?

The sick, the disabled, the less well-off, young people, those on community employment schemes, students, farmers, PAYE workers and the unemployed are all suffering the consequences. In addition, the Minister for Finance is putting a cap on the health board rent allowance, which is payable to the least well-off tenants. This is another deliberate attack on the marginalised in society. Potential home buyers who attended my clinics over the week were in a state of shock. They were sickened by the Government and the guillotine method by which the Minister axed the first-time buyer's grant. The deliberate targeting of the most vulnerable in our society is an indictment of the Government which vowed in May of this year that there would be no cutbacks.Last Thursday was a very wet day, but it was also a dark day for first-time buyers and for the people. We were told that less than €38 million would be gained from this initiative. We are now paying for the cock-ups of the last three budgets. The Minister miscalculated the tax returns of the State, recklessly squandered the taxes and gains of the good years, and is now grabbing at every straw to survive. He shamefully mismanaged our taxes and is now recouping his losses from the weakest sections of the society. The Government must be toppled before it is too late. It went back to the electorate on the Nice treaty referendum. I call on it to go back to the people with the truth. The people have lost confidence and trust in it. We now even have Government backbenchers accusing the Government of pursuing Thatcherite policies and they are probably right. I understand plans to introduce a local poll tax are just around the corner.If allowed to remain in government, Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats will destroy the economy and our country's future. Our standing in Europe and the rest of the world will be greatly undermined and confidence will be lost in our supposedly strong economy. I ask the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Members of the House not to be hypocrites. They should support the motion.

It must be a unique event for two brothers to sit in the ministerial chair in succession. While the economy is not in crisis, as some commentators would have us believe – the figures bear this out – it is the case that prudent management of spending is an absolute necessity. Unfortunately, corrective measures must be taken by the Government and endured by the people.One such measure is the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant scheme as part of the 2003 Estimates. It was a difficult decision for the Government to remove it but it should be supported for taking that decision. Tough decisions are needed in Government. If we want to keep the public finances on an even keel and maintain the confidence and stability that are the very foundation of our economic success, that is what must be done. It is in that context that the decision to end the first-time buyer's grant was taken. This Government does not need to take any lessons about how to destroy an economy. A Fine Gael-Labour coalition could teach any Government a thing or two on that score.

There has been a major fall off in tax revenue since the middle of the year. In this, Ireland is not unique; the same thing is happening in other European countries. The German Government is increasing taxation to recover revenue. We must protect the gains that have been made here. The Government will not be raising direct taxation. We have made great progress in reducing the burden of taxation on enterprise and employment and we recognise that this has been central to our economic success over the last five years. Progressive Democrat policies have helped cut the basic income tax rate from 26% to 20% and the higher rate from 48% to 42%. Capital taxation was halved from 40% to 20% and the standard rate of corporation tax was reduced from 36% to 16%.These policies produced success over the last five years and it is worthwhile recounting those successes. There are 370,000 more people at work, the rate of unemployment is down from 10% to 4%, the number of people in long-term unemployment has fallen from 90,000 to 20,000 and emigration has been ended. If people want to leave the country they do so voluntarily rather than compulsorily as was the case.

We were roundly condemned for our stance but the opposite has happened. When taxes were reduced, revenue increased and better services could be provided. The experience of the last five years clearly disproves the assertions made in 1985.

The challenge is to ensure that we never again return to the scourge of mass unemployment, emigration and the prospect of the International Monetary Fund taking over the management of the economy.The best way to meet that challenge is to ensure prudent management of the public finances. The Government could have taken the soft option in the book of Estimates and Government parties could have ignored the problems on the international front. The way some people are talking, one would think that 11 September, BSE, foot and mouth and the slow down in the international economy did not happen. They are realities and we must deal with them.The Government could have ignored the slow down in tax revenue and could have courted cheap popularity by letting public spending run way ahead of our economic growth, growth that is still good by international standards.

This grant was effectively from the Government to house builders and it was adding to house prices. All experience has shown, and experts agree, that builders rather than first-time buyers were reaping the rewards of the scheme. Peter Bacon is one such expert. The National Economic and Social Council argued as far back as 1993 that such grants were an inefficient and inequitable instrument to tackle housing needs. More importantly, such grants have served to push up house prices and land prices and have done more damage to those struggling to get a foot on the property ladder.Direct hand outs never benefit those to whom they are targeted. There is plenty of evidence of that in agriculture. People get headage payments, go to the marts and give the money to the dealer.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	288	It was Senator Bannon who mentioned manners earlier.The first-time buyer's grant dates back to 1977 when the economy was completely different, with low house prices, crippling interest rates and tax rates as high as 60%. It was introduced at a time when only 18,000 new private houses were being built each year because we did not need them when so many were forced to take the boats. Last year, private housing output amounted to 47,000 units. The economy in the housing market has changed fundamentally and this must be reflected. The onus must now be on the construction industry, consumers and the Government to ensure sensible house prices and affordability.Over time the real impact of the removal of the grant will be seen in the moderation of prices for starter homes. Builders must take account of the removal of the grant and will have to set their prices accordingly, taking cognisance of the market, as they always do. It is what they are doing in the case of the grant.The first-time buyer's grant has outlived any usefulness it had as an economic incentive. Designed to benefit those who qualify, its economic impact has long since been absorbed in house prices. Its value is now considerably exceeded by the value of stamp duty exemption for new houses which the Government proposes to retain. That amounts to €5,900 on the average new house price. In recent years a range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs has been put in place. Between 1998 and 2001 the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by 35% to 11,385 units and a further increase to almost 13,000 is forecast in 2002. This provision will deliver more real and lasting benefit to young couples struggling to buy their own homes than any outdated and ineffectual first-time buyer's grant.If it is the policy of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to reverse this measure, they should tell us how they would fund it. In the case of Fine Gael, it should indicate how it intends to fund some of its other fiscal initiatives, how it would provide hundreds of millions in compensation for taxi plate owners and Eircom shareholders.

Governments can choose between fiscal responsibility and irresponsibility and this Administration and the Minister for Finance have clearly chosen the former. The Government has made hard choices about how and where to spend money when resources are tight and, for me, the top priority in public spending for any Government must be to look after the needs of poorer people, those dependent on social welfare. By tradition social welfare increases are not provided for in the Book of Estimates but in the budget. I am confident that on 4 December the Minister for Finance will be generous to all those on social welfare and will ensure their living standards are maintained.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	295	There are issues to look at here. We could all make speeches about the direct contribution and how inefficient it might be as a means of supporting somebody. There are many on this side, including Senator McDowell, who have never been enthusiastic about the first-time buyer's grant. That is a given. However, it is utterly unacceptable that the way to deal with that is to abolish the grant and not replace it with anything else. I say that specifically in welcoming the Minister of State to the House. If there was a proposal to replace the first-time buyer's grant with something more efficient I would be the first to support it. It is dispiriting, demoralising and undermining the ambitions of young people toabolish it without putting something in its place. The same would apply were it in agriculture. I have referred many times to beef prices.There is also the question of the economy and supply and demand. I agree that on many occasions interference with the market can cause a difficulty. I have always said that the market needs regulation. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will agree there is no normal uninterrupted and uninhibited market in housing. In the Dublin area it is disgraceful that those referred to as the big seven developers have either a lien on or ownership of almost all the development land.Given that we are the legislators, why can we not stop it? We should do it. I live in north County Dublin and I know farmers beside me who have owned their land but have done deals with potential developers who have first call on the land and are paying them for it. No matter which way the council goes the land goes back to them. In the 1930s this matter was dealt with in an efficient way because the legislation provided that where there was a compulsory purchase order on development land, it was bought at agricultural prices and the owners got a premium as it was for development.One of the problems about the first-time buyer's grant is that suddenly it appears the builders are the good guys who are trying to do us a favour. I agree they trousered most of the money but that is of no help to first-time buyers. We have given them, their parents, their immediate and extended families, friends and others who want to be in the same position a focus point at last and I welcome it. Until now I could not get young people to take an interest in the way development land in this county was collared. Neither would they take in interest in profits on housing; they were simply focused on the price. The one good thing about this is that the young population are angry. I am delighted about that because an angry population will question and challenge and eventually the Minister of State will have to respond. He cannot and will not be impervious to that anger.I wish to make a point about the Bacon report. Of the 50,000 houses sold last year, this year and that will be sold next year we know from the figures that 20% will go to first-time buyers. Approximately 10,000 got the €3,000 grant in 2001, according to the Minister's figures. It is simple enough to divide the €38 million by the first-time buyer's grant and one gets 10,000 which is one-fifth of the houses. More than one-fifth goes to those investing to create a rental market. It is about one in four and the rest goes to those changing up and down and so on.In reversing the Bacon report it was done on a one size fits all basis. I listened to the Minister of State on the radio at the weekend and I do not disagree with many of the points he made. I simply disagree with the way the problem has been addressed on this occasion. Will the Minister of State look again at the Bacon report and the problems it appeared to create until we decide our rental market? It is not difficult to make changes to the Bacon report in such a way that the first-time buyer is not in conflict with the investor. Bacon can be put back in place for certain areas, certain types of accommodation or certain types of building. One can choose areas of the city where Bacon will be implemented and the investors will keep out of the area. It can be assigned to certain types of apartments or certain other categories. Time does not permit me to go into this but it can be done. In that way both would be kept apart.What was done at the weekend is something for which all politicians are blamed. I welcome the Labour Party's position on it. We have taken the balance away from the first-time buyer. The article in The Irish Times yesterday by Frank MacDonald was the truth and we all know it. Not only are we bringing investors into the market in terms of the Bacon report but the taxpayer, by forgoing tax revenue, is paying for many of the properties investors are buying to create a rental market. I have no objection to a rental market because it is needed, but the balance is wrong when one is buying against the other. When the investor gets a bigger break than the home owner the balance is wrong. It is wrong and unacceptable. Not only have we failed to give support to first-time buyers but we have failed to give a balance to the market, which is weighted in favour of the investor. It goes against the spirit of the Constitution and against the views of every person in this House including, I have no doubt, the Minister of State. There is a need for a hard look at this issue.I appeal to the Minister of State to reinstate the first-time buyer's grant until such time as he puts something in its place which is more efficient. I would support such a move. This is the only support at present and it is used by young people to put a deposit together in many cases or to furnish their houses.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	296	In launching the 2003 Estimates, the Government acknowledged that difficult decisions had to be made in terms of spending priorities. To do anything less would be irresponsible at a time when the worldwide economic slowdown in growth is impacting seriously on Ireland and our public expenditure is running ahead of tax yields. The abolition of the first-time buyer's new house grant was one of these difficult decisions which the Government had to make in order to ensure a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure.The Government, nonetheless, remains determined to respond effectively to the broad range of housing needs, particularly the needs of lower income groups. We have also continued, in this term in office, with the measures initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing and bring moderation to the rate of house price increases, including increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities.It is clear that these measures have been effective in dealing with the impacts of the unprecedented demand for housing in recent years. In 2001, 52,500 housing units were constructed, of which just under 48,000 were built by the private sector. At 13 houses per 1,000 population, this was the highest rate of house construction in the EU in proportion to population and about four times the UK rate. By contrast, when the first-time buyer's grant was introduced in its present form in 1977 – essentially to encourage new house building – about 17,000 to 18,000 new private houses were built each year. At that time £1,000 was about 7% or 8% of the price of a new house and it had added enormous stimulus to the market.Housing output continues to increase this year with marked increases in the greater Dublin area. The increase in the supply of houses, together with other Government interventions, have brought greater stability to the housing market and moderation to the rate of average house price increases which peaked approximately four years ago when they were rising at about 40% per annum. In addition to specific housing measures, the general improvement in employment and increases in disposable income resulting from economic growth, lower interest rates and tax reductions assisted many individuals in purchasing their homes.While I appreciate that the first-time buyer's grant is obviously of benefit to those who qualify, it has outlived any usefulness it had as an economic incentive. When introduced in 1977 to boost the supply of housing, it represented 7% of the average new house price. At €3,810, it could not be considered to be of critical importance in an individual's decision to purchase a house and its economic impact has long since been absorbed in house prices. Furthermore, its value is now considerably exceeded by the value of the stamp duty exemption, which amounts to some €5,900 on the average new house price.Senator McDowell said – I thought this was most unfair – that we were sending out the message that first-time buyers were on their own. The State assists them through the stamp duty exemption, worth €5,900 on the average new house price and mortgage relief which is a very significant factor at €1,200 per couple in each of the first five years and slightly less thereafter, representing approximately €12,000 to €15,000 of the total purchase price.Senator O'Toole referred to the need to introduce new measures. New measures such as the affordable housing scheme – the scheme of the future – have been introduced. A site subsidy of up to €38,000 per site is now available in Dublin. The figure is approximately €31,000 outside Dublin. This represents an enormous subsidy for those in that bracket. The shared ownership and affordable housing schemes provide subsidies to assist with repayments in the form of a rental subsidy in the first instance and a mortgage subsidy in the latter instance. The subsidy, which is income related, can be as much as €2,550 per annum.I have outlined several forms of assistance being provided by the State for first-time buyers. Many of the schemes mentioned, which have only been introduced in the last couple of years, are targeted more at low income families than is the case with the first-time buyer's grant. To say we are sending out a message to first-time buyers that they are on their own is totally untrue and unfair.Having listened to Opposition speakers, I fail to get their drift. Some criticised Government support for the investor who provides much needed and valued rental accommodation. Senators Bannon and O'Meara spoke about the recent circular issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and stated the Minister was trying to cap rent allowances. If the Minister was to announce an increase in rent allowances, the same individuals would say the Government was giving more money to its friends, the investors. The Government recognises that rents have stabilised or dropped in some instances as a result of the reintroduction of the investor to the market. The Minister is putting a cap on rent allowances which is right and proper. It is not the job of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to make or determine the market. It is reacting to the fact that rents have stabilised and dropped in some cases.Senators Bannon and O'Meara are, on the one hand, complaining about the Government's support for the investor and, on the other, rebuking it for retaining the rent allowance figure. What is important is that rents are holding.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I will speak about housing figures, if the Senator so wishes. In making this difficult decision on the first-time buyer's grant we sought to ensure fair treatment by ensuring all approved and yet to be approved applications in the Department would, subject to the normal conditions of the scheme, qualify for the grant payment. In addition, those who have already made commitments in the form of signed contracts to purchase or build, or where they were building house themselves on which they had already poured the foundations by 14 November 2002 have been given an opportunity to apply for the grant. We did not include those who had paid booking deposits because they did not constitute a contract. In essence, booking deposits are specifically paid "subject to contract" and before a formal written contract is signed either party, vendor or buyer, is free legally to back out and the deposit should be returned. In providing for a grace period up to 4 December for those who had signed contracts or poured foundations before 14 November 2002 we were ensuring those first-time buyers at the most advanced stage of purchase would not be unfairly disadvantaged. It would be almost impossible to manage or control this if we had included those who paid booking deposits.Similarly, we are also ensuring those on the lowest incomes, that is, households qualifying under the affordable housing scheme, are not disadvantaged by the abolition of grants. Again, the Department will honour any contracts entered into by local authorities prior to 14 November 2002 where the applicant has provided for a power of attorney in respect of the new house grant. This point was raised by Senator Kitt. The same applies where a local authority has issued a certificate of final approval in relation to a shared ownership application.In addition, local authorities have been informed that the deposit under the scheme may be reduced from 5% of the house price to 3%, where appropriate, for all applicants who do not qualify for a first-time buyer's grant. The practise had developed in Dublin whereby the first-time buyer's grant was being treated by local authorities as part of the deposit. To compensate, the deposit is being reduced to 3% of the house price.The Government has a strong commitment to respond to those in need of social housing and those with special needs. However, we have to target our resources wisely to meet this demand. In recent years a range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs have been put in place. Between 1998 and 2001 the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by some 35% to 11,385 units and a further increase to almost 13,000 units is forecast in 2002. I accept that, although one houses 13,000 people, sadly, as many more join the waiting list.The figures I published last week regarding needs assessment showed that the number on the waiting list had increased by 23%, although many groups were issuing figures in trying to create the impression that the figures were higher. Yes, the figures have increased over the last three years, but one has to recognise that 32% of those on local authority waiting lists are single while 29% are lone parents with one child. Ten years ago those single people would not have got on a local authority waiting list unless they were over 60 years of age, which accounts for only 4% of the 32%. Like is not compared with like when we compare the current figures with those from some years ago. A huge new wave of single people has been allowed to apply for local authority housing and 32% of those on local authority lists are single or separated.I anticipate that local authority housing output this year will be the highest for 16 years, at 5,500 units, and the output of the voluntary and co-operative sector is likely to reach an all time high at 1,500 units. Activity is also increasing significantly under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. In the first six months of this year, over 350 homes were completed under the affordable housing scheme and a further 1,800-odd units were in progress at the end of June last. Local authorities assisted 710 households with shared ownership homes in the first six months of this year. The prospects are good for substantial growth in activity next year also.It is clear that, apart from these schemes, the house building industry is also responding to the need for more affordable housing with an increased supply coming on stream, particularly in the greater Dublin area. There have recently been some innovative schemes developed between local authorities, particularly in the greater Dublin area, and private builders. Fingal County Council has schemes in Mulhuddart and the surrounding area – one has over 700 units and the mix is about 400 affordable, 100 social and up to 200 private homes. That mix, which is far better than what could have been achieved under Part V, is the way forward. It is a pity that builders did not work at this before the big stick of Part V came into force. The scheme in Mulhuddart also has a community centre and child care facility.Many units and developments are coming into being and that shows that affordable housing will be the big area for future development. Local authorities can claim from the Department a site subsidy of up to £38,000 on affordable homes, which is of enormous significance in being able to provide cheaper starter homes. These are high quality homes and they are "cheap" in the sense that the site is cheaper or subsidised by the Department. That is a marvellous move and, over the next couple of years, the number of affordable units will rocket. They will cater for an existing demand.I accept, when one looks at the housing statistics published last week, there are people in a certain income bracket on housing lists who would not have applied for local authority housing in the past and who do not wish to be on the lists. If these people are assisted, they will be able to get their own homes. Measures such as the rental subsidy scheme and the site subsidy scheme are more focused and targeted at the right people than the first-time buyer's grant was.We must consolidate the substantial progress made in increasing housing output and responding to those most in need. Next year total capital funding for housing – Exchequer and non-Exchequer – at €1.7 billion will be up 7% on the amount provided this year, almost double the spending of two years ago. Our priority is to respond to those most in need. The provisions available for social rented accommodation are likely to allow for some increased starts under the local authority programme and for the voluntary and co-operative sector to continue its increased contribution to social housing as envisaged under the NDP.

While I appreciate that abolition of a scheme inevitably causes disappointment, particularly for those who hoped to benefit from the scheme, our focus must now be on the more targeted schemes and particularly the housing needs of lower income groups. The range of schemes and supports which I mentioned are more targeted. It is the philosophy of the Government that we assist those in the lower income brackets who wish to buy their own homes. The housing market is complex and it is amusing when people criticise the Government and say it has changed policy a couple of times over the past five years. The Government has changed policy. Normally, the complaint would be that the Government is locked into its policies and will not move to the left, right or centre. The housing market is like a see-saw.

If you, a Chathaoirligh, ever read a book of quotes from Oscar Wilde, you will not be as entertained by those quotes as you would be by the quotes of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, throughout the general election campaign which saw them returned to govern for another five years on a tissue of lies. We were told there would be no cutbacks by several Ministers who have been rewarded for telling lies by being appointed to those Ministries. The bright eyed boy from Cork South-Central, Deputy Micheál Martin, told Cathal Mac Coille that there would not be cutbacks.

I thought he was just the bright eyed boy. He is a Minister and also the bright eyed boy.A part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1997 stated explicitly that "we will improve the first-time home buyer grant to £5,000 where the house is being bought in the joint names of a couple". The rhetoric and hypocrisy that successive Ministers have been piking out of the stables of Government over the past week lead me to believe that they had no meas for this grant. This begs the question why it was included in their election manifesto of 1997. Votes were won and the Cabinet table was filled by the star performers who had ensured in one fell swoop that the first-time buyer's grant would be eradicated almost as mysteriously as the Marie Celeste. They have done it with a speed that would do justice to an Olympic sprinter.I do not know which annoys me most about the abolition of this scheme – the willy-nilly fashion of its abolition or that the Government has spent the last week trying to defend it. That insults the intelligence of the people, especially young people. Those young people have made provision for that grant. They are pushed into banks to try to come to some sort of agreement whereby they can own their homes. That is their right. Ireland has the highest concentration of home ownership in the European Union. That is a very healthy thing about this economy and our young people. However, the Government has slashed the grant that pushed people from local authority waiting lists into a position where they are sufficiently equipped to buy their own homes.This is another act of butchery and savagery by this arch conservative Government – arch conservative by the accusation of a former Minister of State from the constituency of Cork East, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who was lined up with about another dozen rebels from the other House and, I suspect, a few from this House who attended the parliamentary party meeting this afternoon. Those Fianna Fáil members who have played to the media, the press and young people in the past week should put their vote where their mouth is. This is a motion which not only condemns the action of the Minister but calls for the immediate reintroduction of the first-time buyer's grant. We put it to them to vote with us and show an act of faith for the many thousands of young people who availed of the scheme through the years and who will need, especially in the current economic climate, to avail of it in future.Many decisions in the Estimates were, and I suspect many in the budget will be, hard hitting but none is as cruel and barbaric as the elimination of the first-time buyer's grant. The Minister for Finance had the further gall to say on national television last week when interviewed by a reputable journalist that the grant of €3,800 was little or nothing.

The display of arrogance and ill manners by some Members of the House while other Members attempted to make fine and eloquent contributions on the debate is almost as galling as the fact that we must have the debate in the first place.Why for once can this arch conservative Government not pursue the rich boys? Why not chase the developers and the multi-millionaire builders who pack the Fianna Fáil hospitality tent at the Galway races every year? Why chase the people at the other end of the market and add insult to injury by capping the rent allowance from health boards? It is disgraceful and appalling and sends out a stark and sinister message to young people who can no longer avail of the first-time buyer's grant that they will be forced onto local authority waiting lists. These have grown in County Cork by 75% in the last three years.We have listened to assertions that the grant was never what it was supposed to be and that the Bacon reports were used to guide housing policy. In fact they were used to rush to the defence of a housing policy that would make the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in her day look like a baby with a bag of Jelly Tots.It is essential that young people in any democratic state should be encouraged when they set out to make a life for themselves. While times were good in recent years, the Government gave all it could to the golden circle, no matter of whom it was comprised. If one is not in that circle and earning hundreds of thousands per annum, one has no rights according to this morally bankrupt Administration which views people, especially young people, with contempt, as displayed last week by the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant.Around the time of the launch of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, a document which, when presented on television, produced as much entertainment as the Punch and Judy show, and also around the time when the money was thrown around like confetti, Champagne Charlie, the Minister for Finance, wrote to an honourable and decent politician in the other House, Deputy Noonan, and assured him: "I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise". One does not need a degree in politics or economics to know that such plain and simple English tells us that the Minister was either taking us for a massive ride or he was telling lies. It is simply one or the other.The Minister of State should urge the Taoiseach, who also beats Banagher when it comes to debates such as this, to reintroduce the scheme immediately. He need only look at the people benefiting from it. I am a young person and understand full well the financial constraints on young people who must leave for work early in the morning and do not get home until late in the evening and who depend on the grant to buy a house. No matter how miserly or ineffectual some think it to be, it has been worth a great deal to the tens of thousands of young people who have availed of it in recent years.

When house price increases peaked at 40% in 1998, there was a clamour, mostly from the Opposition parties, for the Government to examine ways to stop the dramatic rise. Everyone argued that something must be done.Through a series of measures, housing supply was increased to try to meet demand while at the same time maintaining and improving affordability. The results are evident. The number of units built last year was 52,600, which was the seventh year of record output, interest rates are at their lowest for a long time and price increases have now been reduced to 5.7%. There are a number of contributory factors to these achievements. Some have been outside our control, but most have been the result of strong, prudent economic management of the economy. The so-called Celtic tiger, a media generated term I detest, dramatically increased disposable incomes and employment. These joined with lower tax levels and high levels of economic growth contributed to an increased supply of properties.It is agreed that more needs to be done to maintain this progress. As someone who benefited from the first-time buyer's grant when I took advantage of a subsidised mortgage from a housing financing agency when I started off, I found the abolition of the grant surprising but understandable. Times have changed. When it was introduced in 1987 the market and economic climate were different. Perhaps we have been victims of our own success. The result of the improvements over which my party has presided is that the focus and effectiveness of the grant has been lost. It was originally conceived as an assistance for people to enter the housing market. Most new buyers today do not benefit directly from it but builders do. Some lending institutions include the grant in the calculation of their eligibility criteria for a loan. The purchaser never sees the grant. Some people buying property for investment purposes also avail of it.I welcome the Minister of State's announcements about the affordable and social housing schemes. The enhancement of more targeted and effective schemes, such as the shared ownership and social and affordable housing schemes, benefit those who otherwise could not aspire to home ownership. Co-operative housing initiatives contribute greatly to tackling local authority housing lists.The redirection of resources in favour of these areas can only benefit those most in need of assistance. In the current economic climate, hard decisions must be made but I am convinced that the Government will continue to manage matters fairly and firmly and will continue to make the difficult decisions to prevent us returning to the horrendous conditions in which we found ourselves in the 1980s when the grant was first introduced.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I thank Senator Brady for sharing his time. I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State. It is good that he is in a position to listen to the diverse views we have heard.It will disappoint some Opposition Members to learn that I support the amendment. I believe in the measure taken, although it was a difficult one. The abolition of the scheme was a difficult decision the Government was required to take to ensure a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure. Difficult decisions had to be taken in the context of the current economic performance. We have been elected to take those decisions. Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting when decisions are needed to ensure prudent management of the economy. Analysis has shown that this scheme was no longer the best way to target the disadvantaged. The Minister of State alluded to this.The new house grants scheme was introduced in its present form in 1977 when only 17,000 or 18,000 new private houses were being built each year. Last year private housing output amounted to 37,487 units. The main purpose of the grant was to encourage new house building. Although no longer the case, when first introduced it was a support for the construction industry. For this reason first-time purchasers who bought existing houses did not receive grant assistance. At the time the grant was set at the high level of £1,000 in order to boost new house building. That sum represented about 7% of the average new house price. Today, at €3,800, it represents only 2% of the average new house price and is no longer such a major element in the calculation for the purchase of a house.The grant was, effectively, inequitable as it did not provide assistance for the purchase of a second-hand house. Unlike my colleague, Senator Brady, I was not fortunate enough to take advantage of the measure as I could not afford a new house and had to buy a second-hand house. Those who bought new homes were able to use the grant to buy the furnishings and trappings that I had to wait about 18 months to afford.In considering the 2003 Estimates the Government was obliged to look carefully at every expenditure programme and scheme. The new house grant has outlived its usefulness as an economic incentive. While obviously of benefit to those who qualified for it, its economic impact has long been absorbed into the house price. Its value has now been considerably exceeded by the value of the stamp duty exemption for new houses. The Government proposes to retain this exemption which amounts to about €5,900.In recent years a range of better targeted schemes, to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs, have been put in place. I am delighted the Minister of State has defended this and outlined clearly that this is a better way forward. Between 1998 and 2001 the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by 35% to 11,385 units and a further increase of almost 13,000 units is forecast for 2002. It is clear there was an overlap in the system. On the one hand, we still had the first-time buyer's grant while, on the other, the real area of disadvantage was being catered for. As the Minister of State indicated, the money that will now be saved in this regard will be available to assist in the provision of social and affordable housing. This will assist those mentioned by Senator O'Meara to get on the ladder for the first time.A number of Opposition speakers mentioned the so-called friends of Fianna Fáil – the people who own vast amounts of rental property. Not too long ago the Opposition accused the Government of being in cahoots with the same people in the sense that the Revenue take was increased by their numbers. The Government has made prudent decisions based on the Bacon report and others. If we were to remove investors from the market, as was done in the past, the rental market would be stymied and the people hit would be those who could never dream of being involved in the purchase of a house. At the minute we are talking about those on the margins of being able or unable to afford to buy a house. Those who have to rent cannot even contemplate purchasing. If we removed the investors from the market, we would disenfranchise the people concerned.

I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his interest in housing despite the fact that things seem to be going backwards. People are angry and will not let the Government away with this. It is up to us to express their anger. No matter what way the Minister of State colours it the measure is draconian and we are calling for its reversal. If we did not, we would be failing in our duty.I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the grant having outlived its usefulness as an economic incentive, but that history lesson coming without any advance warning is unfair. I would almost go so far as to say it is a bit of a con. The measure has killed the hopes and aspirations of first-time buyers. What is more serious is that, not only does it affect people on a personal level, but it also puts more pressure on local authority housing lists which are increasing all the time.The Government must swallow its pride and back down on this farcical measure, otherwise the economy will reap the consequences for a long time to come. Not alone has the Minister for Finance dashed the hopes of thousands of young people, but the Government will become known as a Government of dream wreckers. The dream of most young people is to own their own house. The first-time buyer's grant may not matter much to the Minister for Finance, but it is of critical importance to young couples. The Government deserves condemnation for its callous action. It is unfair, was announced without notice and leaves many couples who have booked new homes high and dry.I appreciate what the Minister of State said about those who have signed contracts. Unfortunately, many new homes are being sold off the plans. This is a disastrous measure, unless the Minister for Finance intends to introduce mortgage interest relief in the budget to cover for it.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I appeal to the Minister to restore the €3,800 first-time buyer's grant. Young people in the west are trying to purchase their own homes. They want pride, esteem and self-confidence and do not want to rely on hand-outs or council housing. Now they are being put under added pressure and councils will have to provide for them with depleted resources. People were relying on the first-time buyer's grant to afford their dream. I welcomed the CLÁR project which created opportunities through installing sewerage schemes, roads, footpaths, lighting and water etc. I also welcomed the establishment of the Western Development Commission.The Minister has removed the budgets for all of these. The Government has cut the budget for the Western Development Commission by over 70% and that for the CLÁR project by over €3 million. The Minister for Finance is saying, as Cromwell did, to hell or to Connacht. This is an attack on the people of the west and the few young people left there. We have all had aspirations of a united Ireland, but my belief is that there will be a new six counties in the future – the six counties of Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Leitrim and Galway which are being left out of the equation of a 32-county Ireland.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I thank Senators Coghlan and Feighan for sharing time. I echo their sentiments on behalf of my county council as well as talking on behalf of the rest of the people who have spent the past two to three years pre-planning the building of a house. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, may have no expertise in pre-planning, budgeting and putting money aside for a rainy day or a project. From 14 November, people who had not paid a deposit to a builder will not get the €3,810 grant. I am looking forward to an election in a year's time when people on the Government side will be canvassing houses in their areas where there might be no kitchen or fireplace or wooden floors because this €3,810 was part of their budget set aside to pay for a part of their house. These people have been betrayed by the Government because they were not consulted on this change. It is a disgrace. I speak on behalf of many young people and I call for the immediate reinstatement of the first-time buyer's grant.
#MichaelBrennan2	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I wish to share my time with Senator Morrissey. In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House, I support the amendment. The Government's first priority is to get the country back to a sustainable rate of spending in order to avoid a long-term crisis. To do this, tough measures have had to be taken in different areas. The Government's decision on the first-time buyer's grant was taken to ensure a sustainable rate of spending and prevent a long-term crisis in public spending.As many speakers have said, the first-time buyer's grant was introduced in 1977. We all remember the state the construction industry was in at the time and how few houses were being built. It was an initiative to support the less well off in our society to build a house of less than 1,346 sq. ft. An average of 10,000 grants per year have been given in the past five years. The grant was introduced at a time when only 17,000 to 18,000 houses were being built in the private sector. The scheme was initiated to encourage the building of more new houses as demand had exceeded supply. Last year there were 47,000 private housing units so the need to encourage new housing development has greatly changed.As the Minister, Deputy Noel Ahern, has rightly said, the Government should now focus on responding to the needs of low income households and those with special housing needs through a broad range of targeted initiatives. I ask the Minister for Finance to give consideration to these people who would have qualified for housing grants. He should consider giving tax credits amounting to €10,000 over a five year period to people who would have qualified for grants in the past. Some 27% to 34% of the cost of building those houses now goes back to the Government in taxes.Fianna Fáil has always helped those less well off in our society in areas such as housing and social welfare. I ask the Minister for Finance to continue to do so in the forthcoming budget. A balance needs to be struck in Government housing policy in the budget. It must aim to target scarce financial resources and to build social and affordable housing. The Government, local authorities and the building industry need to come together to tackle this problem and work for the common good in both the public and private sectors. I welcome the public private partnership that has taken place in Fingal. Local authorities have ample scope to meet the housing needs through the serviced sites initiative. I am delighted the Minister has seen fit to increase the funding available for that next year.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I am delighted to welcome the Minister. While I know thousands of people have benefited from this scheme, I received the first-time buyer's grant, but I was not a beneficiary. After I paid my booking deposit, the house price increased by the corresponding amount. This has been the practice since 1981. I purchased my first house on the weekend the first-time buyer's grant was increased by £1,000 to £3,000 at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis. The following week builders increased prices by the same amount.About 10,000 people benefit from this scheme each year, but there are 33,600 first-time buyers every year. About 70% of the first-time buyers do not buy new houses; they buy second-hand houses. They do not get grant relief. Some could argue that is a distortion of the market. At present the average house price is about €190,000. This grant represents a mere 2% of that price, which would not affect the decision whether to buy. In the early 1980s it represented 10% of the value of the house and it certainly made a difference in deciding whether to buy. There are many other initiatives the Government has for first-time buyers but this scheme does nothing to increase the supply of land, which is the greatest impediment to solving the housing crisis.Over the weekend, Colm McCarthy, an economist, said:There can be no control without clean decisions, including the use of the word "no". One such was the decision to scrap grants for first-time home buyers. There is always a suspicion that cash grants, which stimulate demand in housing but which have no effect on supply, end up in the price and really benefit landowners rather than the intended beneficiaries. The decision to scrap the scheme is long overdue.I agree with that.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	329	It is a pleasure to welcome the Minister to the House because, of the two brothers, I have nice things to say to him; I had to be a little firm with his one of his brothers today. It is a pleasure because of the reasonable and balanced nature of what he had to say. Although I sit on this side of the House, he and the other contributors on the Government side convinced me of their argument even though it is a very difficult one indeed and I shall be voting with the Government tonight.I remember meeting the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the corridor after the last general election. I told him he had been a good Minister for Finance and he had a capacity to be a great one provided he broke every single promise he made during the election campaign. I am glad to see he has started on that, because it is necessary. There is considerable hypocrisy in this place because the last general election was guided by auctioneering principles. I remember when certain parties, which will be nameless, were offering to recoup losses on the Stock Exchange in an effort to buy votes. It is perfectly obvious that cuts have to be made. With wise economic tactics we can get back on track within 18 months. In that circumstance, it is extremely foolish to advocate cuts, but not here or there. In that case where?It is very difficult and I have great sympathy for young people who want to get into the housing market and one's heart goes out to them. However, this is one among a large number of areas that will be cut. When rents were frozen during the First World War it led to the destruction of the inner city of Dublin because it was not possible to get economic rents. It is one thing to freeze rents during wartime; it is another thing to unfreeze them. No Government had the courage to do it until Mr. Madigan took a constitutional action.This grant is already discriminatory because it discriminates against buyers of second-hand houses. Why do only new houses qualify? The Government has said this was to act as an incentive to the building industry. The former Senator, Deputy Jim Glennon, got it right – and was backed up by Government Senators – when he said the building industry trousered the grant. Perhaps, in a time of excess, that is acceptable but the building industry must now be faced down. It treats its customers with contempt, allowing them to be gazumped and refusing point blank to tell them the square footage of rooms in properties and so on. It is about time the arrogance of the building industry was taken into consideration and it was taken down a peg or two.The principle of spending cuts should be to cut flab. I am not suggesting this is the case for all first-time buyers but I have heard some harrowing stories – and I am sure the Minister and his advisers will be able to target resources towards these people – from people who said they would not have a carpet before Christmas if they did not get the grant. That would break my heart but it is the way married life always was – and I do not speak as any great authority on marriage. In my first co-habitation in Jerusalem we did not have a carpet, nor did we even have a pair of curtains but I was damn glad to be in that house with the person I cared about.I am prepared to take the cuts. If the Minister wants to cut the SSIAs, where I was advised to shove my money, he can do so. The Government can have the money back as far as I am concerned. We must all experience a bit of the pain. We must cut the flab, continue developing infrastructure and make painful decisions. I will stick by the Minister because I think he is doing the right thing.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I am sorry to part company with my right-wing friend but occasionally these things happen. With a great deal of soul searching, I will support this motion. There is an obligation on those who are not part of the Government not to oppose all cuts but rather to make serious suggestions about where they should be made because everyone acknowledges they are necessary. The Labour Party may also propose, with honesty and integrity, that the budget should be balanced through taxation but it is not enough simply to oppose this measure. If I have time tomorrow, I will suggest where cuts can be made which would be more palatable, fair, appropriate and timely.There is a real problem in this nation with private sector housing. I am not a free marketeer to the same extent as Senator Norris. I do not believe the market should never be interfered with under any circumstances. However, as a general principle the Government is right that the housing grant was fundamentally flawed when it was introduced. It was designed to give the construction industry a boost but its effect was to distort the market and give an illusory benefit to those who got the grant.The housing market has taken off and become a terrible social problem. The free market has gone mad in that sector and the Government, despite several attempts and a succession of reports by Peter Bacon, has been unable to solve the problem. It is untrue to say that this is a mechanism and that builders have raised the price of houses by €3,800 because, as the Minister of State and other Members will know, the cheque is issued after the purchase is completed. It is not a totally illusory benefit. People make their calculations, they borrow a certain amount of money from parents and so on and work out that they will get €3,800 to furnish the house. That is the reality. There may be a degree of circular movement but people who are in this extraordinarily penal market are being punished for being there.If the Government were to come forward with budget proposals to cut the grant because it is distorting the market but if it also introduced measures to ameliorate the circumstances of people who have suffered greatly in this market, I would support this measure. However, we have heard nothing to that effect. If there were reasonable balancing measures, it would be acceptable. We are talking about €38 million or €40 million, which is peanuts. As a public relations exercise, this is something about which the Government should have been advised. Once again, it has picked some unfortunate victims and they need protection because they are in the market – a jungle they do not understand.I will vote for this motion but I have a difficulty bowing a knee to the Irish Congress of Trades Unions in motions of this sort. I see no reason why the Labour Party needs to give reassurance to these people that it is their party and will support them at all costs.

I support the social and affordable housing programme, even those parts that are not particularly popular with builders and I hope the Government will adhere to it. The first-time buyer's grant was of value and importance to some people but in many cases it was absorbed into the builder's price. The Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, fully understands the limitations of the value of the first-time buyer's grant.The real problem is that young people are unable to get into the market. A massive inter-generational redistribution of wealth to older people who own houses is taking place and that is regrettable. I was appalled by the recent commment of an estate agent that the property market is growing ever onwards and upwards. That is the psychology of the South Sea Bubble. I do not believe it but it is pernicious.The Government must, in a budgetary context, look at the imbalance that has been created by removing the first-time buyer's grant. I do not like when professional people who have more money than they know what to do with put their money into the housing market, crowding it and making it impossible for younger people to buy into. It is not the Government's job to sustain the housing market at an unrealistic price level. Apart from the social and affordable housing which deals with one segment of the population, we need to look at measures to dampen the market. Having been a member of the tax strategy group for the last five years, I know this is not an easy thing to get right but that should be the priority rather than the health of the building industry.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	336	This has been a night of revelations for me. The first is that Fianna Fáil seems to have discovered that the building industry has been ripping off the nation for 20 years when in fact it is the number one conspirator in allowing it to happen. The party allowed those who fund it – and keep members in the style to which they are accustomed – to rip off the nation and it has done so consistently for 20 years. Fianna Fáil has taken their donations and encouraged builders and speculators with grants. It has left them alone and is still doing so.The Government will not introduce proper regulation of the private rented sector because its friends do not want it. It reduced capital gains tax because its friends wanted it. As Senator McDowell said, it has refused to implement the full provisions of the Bacon report to tax speculative land because its friends do not want it. However, we have now had successive speakers on the Government side wringing their hands about cruel builders ripping people off. We know what has been happening for the last 20 years, but apparently it only dawned on Fianna Fáil tonight, which is welcome. At least, it has forced Fianna Fáil members to concede that their friends in the building industry have given this country an abysmal service in terms of price, quality, customer relations and follow-up to faults in new buildings. Now that Fianna Fáil has discovered the problem and admitted to it, perhaps the Government will do something about it by giving young couples some guarantee of quality and some rights, rather than being expected to buy from plans which give very little information about the property in question. Now that Fianna Fáil has admitted what its friends are like, will it stop taking their money to fund the party? Perhaps something has been learned.The second revelation is the realisation that €4,000 is an insignificant sum. When Frank Dunlop was giving money to members of Dublin County Council, £1,000 was enough to buy votes for rezoning. To most people in the State €4,000 is a lot of money. It is only those in Fianna Fáil who have lost contact with reality who consider it a small sum.The third revelation is that capping rent allowances is supposed to push down rents. What it will actually do is push poor people out on the street. This has been a desired objective of the Department of Finance for many years. The Department did not like an open-ended guarantee to anybody in need of housing that their rent would be covered if they could find accommodation. It has been trying to get rid of this socially correct measure for the past 20 years and has now got it from the Government under a smokescreen about rent stabilisation. There is no point in telling young people in this city that rents have stabilised. During the week The Irish Times published a letter from a young man with a good job who could not afford a single room in this city, yet the Government claims that rents have gone down while poor people are being pushed out of private rented accommodation. Nobody believes the Government on the issue.The fourth revelation is that there is no housing crisis. Any Member of this or the other House will confirm that housing is the single biggest issue being raised at their clinics, yet, according to the Minister of State, there is no crisis, the problem has been solved, plenty of houses are being built and most people on the housing lists are not in the same category as were formerly on them. The people my colleagues, Senators on the other side of the House and I meet are victims of the crisis on which the Government sat for five years. I will move on to revelation No. 6.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The supply of building land presents a problem, but, yet again, it is the supporters of Fianna Fáil who are sitting on it. They hope to get rid of the present appalling provision, as they see it, for social and affordable housing in order that they can maximise their returns from land they will not now sell to provide housing for those who desperately need it. There is a solution to which Senator O'Toole referred. The landowners concerned should be given the choice of selling the land or having it acquired at current use value. This could be done, but Fianna Fáil will not do it because its friends own the land.The final revelation, after a week of hot air and smoke, is that Fianna Fáil backbenchers have absolutely no influence. They exist only for the purpose of doing what they are told. They lined up and did just that, despite all the hot air at constituency level, saying the very opposite of what they said last week. If that is the extent of their influence, what is their purpose in being here? I do not care whether they vote with or against us.

Such a viable infrastructure would contribute to the balanced development of the wide area served by the cross-radial railway, often referred to as the western rail corridor. We are very fortunate to have a former Member of this House, Martin J. O'Toole, as chairman and Fr. Micheál MacGréil as secretary. I welcome Fr. MacGréil to the House this evening.There is great support for this development in the west from the statutory voluntary bodies and county councillors, people who are interested in the quality and balanced development of the west. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, intervened in the past to stop the railway being lifted north of Tuam, for which I thank him. The Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, was very supportive of this line and put it on a study programme. I hope we will get positive action on this issue. We are very disappointed at the unilateral action of Iarnród Éireann in severing the north-south link line at Athenry. It has annoyed and disappointed members of the committee and community in County Galway.The promise to reopen the Athenry turnout to Tuam in the event of a positive Government decision does not satisfy the committee. It is difficult for our committee to fathom the pre-emptive strike by Iarnród Éireann against the northern half of the western corridor. It is another blow against the proper development of the west and north west. We must never forget that the railway belongs to the people. In fact, we are not looking for a lot of money. Fr. MacGréil has often referred to it as "crumbs from the table". I hope the Minister will be able to help us in this regard.As well as the action in Athenry, the railway committee is totally opposed to the phasing out of freight traffic on the railway. There are many plans to transport timber from the forests to the west and north west. It has been reported that private freight companies would be interested in developing the western rail corridor as a major route should the infrastructure be made available. It is the policy of our committee to promote cross-radial inter-city passenger and commuter traffic between rural towns in Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Clare and in and out of the three major cities of Limerick, Galway and Sligo. There is a huge amount of traffic and congestion on the N17 between Tuam and Galway. A railway line which is in existence can bring commuters right into Eyre Square. In fact, part of the film, "The Quiet Man" was filmed on this particular line at Ballyglunin.The western rail corridor is in the Border, midland and western region, known as the BMW region. Objective One status was achieved because of the disadvantage of the region. If Objective One status means anything, it should mean extra resources for infrastructures such as railways, for example, the western rail corridor. I hope the Minister will be able to help us as other Ministers have done in the past.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The issue of Irish Rail's removal of the crossover at Athenry was raised in the House on 14 November last when the Minister dealt with it in some detail. The situation is essentially unchanged since that debate.As the Minister explained, Irish Rail advised him that Athenry is being resignalled as part of a project to modernise the signalling system on the Dublin to Galway line. Design work has been completed for some time and installation work is under way at various stations on the line and is scheduled to be completed in mid-2003. On completion, passengers on the Galway to Dublin line can expect a significant improvement in terms of comfort, safety and speed on the route. When lines are resignalled the opportunity is taken to simplify the track layout of the line based on present services and traffic. The Minister is informed by Irish Rail that there have been no services on the Athenry-Claremorris line for some considerable time. He is assured by the company that should a demand for services on this line arise, the connection can be restored quickly and easily. It stated that no other track work will be lifted on the Athenry-Claremorris line.For Irish Rail to replace the crossover now would require a revision of the design and planning work that has gone into the project to date. The work would then need to be programmed into the existing work schedule. The Minister has no doubt that this will lead to slippage in both the financial targets and the delivery dates of the project. This project is being part funded by the EU. Senators may well recall that an earlier version of it was the subject of an inquiry. As a result, this current project is being very carefully monitored by the EU Commission.The strategic rail review, which is nearing completion, is examining the future options for this and other railway lines throughout the State. The review will examine the long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole in light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The purpose of the review is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework and direction for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland for the next 20 years.The Minister understands that the submissions included proposals for the development of the western rail corridor which would link Sligo with Cork via Claremorris, Athenry and Limerick. This proposal, together with all the other rail proposals received is currently being assessed by the review consultants who, in finalising the review, will make recommendations in regard to them.The Minister expects to be in a position to publish the strategic rail review in late January 2003.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House to give his views on the stress caused to many local residents and businesses in the Clonee, Dunboyne and Mulhuddart areas last weekend, together with its impact on the residents of Drumcondra. The Minister of State will be aware that Dunboyne-Clonee is a fast growing area. Some 7,000 houses will be granted planning permission in the Clonee general area, together with the huge development taking place in Dunboyne. In addition, the proposed county development plan will increase development along the N3.We have no expert advice on this yet, but the general consensus is that because of all the houses built in the area, there is now an immediate run-off to the Tolka and lands do not have time to drain. Underground drainage systems may have been disturbed as well as various tributaries. I call on the Minister to instigate a programme of action. Three council areas, Meath, Fingal and the city council, are affected by this problem and there is no point in having each council do its own thing. I understand works done by Meath County Council on the Tolka in Clonee village might have contributed to the problem. The basin of the river was essentially corralled into a pipe which led to some of the flooding.At the weekend many houses in the areas concerned were flooded, distress was caused to families and young children and losses were incurred by local businesses and the local and national economy, as could be seen by looking at the radial routes coming into Dublin, which had been completely blocked by people not able to get to work. Goods and services were not being delivered to businesses. Clonee is an old village, but many new premises have now been established. Approximately 300 people work in the village. I welcome the humanitarian aid being directed to the victims through the Red Cross and ask that it be extended or that some consideration be given to businesses in the area because the heart has been torn out of the village. If there is not a vibrant village, there will be no services for the communities concerned. I ask the Minister to examine this as well as the damage caused to houses and consider an integrated action plan through the three councils.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	349	On my own behalf and that of the Government, I express sympathy to everyone affected by flooding in recent days. It has been a very traumatic time, as the Senator said, for those whose homes have been flooded. We all saw what happened on television and the newspapers and I had an opportunity of seeing some of the devastation. Serious flooding occurred in many parts of the country. The cause was exceptionally heavy rainfall during a two day period on 9 and 10 November, which led to flooding of homes in Athlone, and again on 14 and 15 November, which primarily affected the east of the country, particularly Dublin city, Meath and Kildare. On its own, this concentrated heavy rainfall would not have been expected to have such disastrous consequences, but when combined with two and a half times the average rainfall in the month of October and the first two weeks in November, it led to the disastrous consequences we have witnessed.The immediate concern is to respond quickly to those affected by the flooding. Emergency plans were put into action by several local authorities. I commend the local authority staff, the Civil Defence, the Army, the Garda, the fire brigade, health authority staff and my own staff in the Office of Public Works, who were on the spot straight away helping those whose homes were flooded and some whose travel arrangements had been disrupted. The commitment of public service and voluntary staff in this type of situation is exceptional and deserves recognition. Unfortunately, it is only when we have a disaster on our hands that it comes to the fore.As soon as the seriousness of the situation and the numbers of homes affected by the flooding became apparent, I asked my officials in the Office of Public Works to begin preparations for initiating a humanitarian aid scheme. The House will be aware that the Government has approved such schemes in similar situations in the past – most recently following the devastating flooding in Dublin city in February this year. The House will be aware also that at its meeting yesterday the Government approved my proposal to initiate a similar scheme which will be administered by the Red Cross on behalf of the Office of Public Works. Applications forms for the scheme are available from the Red Cross at a freefone number, 1800 923 424, and at the Red Cross website, www.redcross.ie. The eligibility criteria are extreme hardship, homelessness, damage to homes and serious injury. The scheme does not provide for compensation for losses – it provides for assistance where extreme hardship has been suffered.The closing date for receipt of applications by the Red Cross is 6 December. Following this, the Red Cross will commence the process of evaluating applications and visiting all applicants to assess need. Payments will commence a number of weeks later. The scheme will be funded from within existing financial allocations to the Office of Public Works. The extent of funding required will become apparent in the next few days as applications are received and more information is collated on the extent of damage caused. Recent comments in the media suggest that approval of funding for the scheme somehow represents a reversal of Government decisions on the Estimates. This is not the case. These schemes are, of their nature, entirely unpredictable and it is not the practice to provide for them in advance in the Estimates.The flooding in Dublin city and Meath arose from the River Tolka and its tributaries. The Tolka has had a history of carrying significant run-off flows within its watercourse and has flooded frequently, most recently in November 2000. The catchment area of the river falls within the functional area of three local authorities, Meath and Fingal county councils and Dublin City Council. As the lower and middle catchments of the river, and certain concentrated areas within the upper catchment, have witnessed significant increases in land development, the risk of flood damage to property and infrastructure has also increased. There has never been a fully inclusive analysis of the river's behaviour under a full range of potential floods and certainly no investigation of the catchment's response to severe rainfall as it is currently developed and planned to be developed.In June 2001 Dublin City Council commissioned the greater Dublin strategic drainage study, GDSDS, a multi-million euro engineering study of the strategic drainage requirements of the greater Dublin area. Given the history of flooding in the Tolka and on the initiative of the Office of Public Works, the city council agreed to include a study of the Tolka in the GDSDS. The flooding element of the study is funded by the Office of Public Works at a cost of €870,000. The study is expected to be completed in May 2003. Surveying is now completed and the consultants are commencing work on the hydraulic model of the catchment. Meath and Fingal county councils are also participating in the study.The aim of the study is to produce a comprehensive report that will include the development of a robust model representing the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of the River Tolka catchment. Such a model will have the ability to map flood risk. Using model output the technical and economic merit of various options for flood management, taking account of current and future land developments, will be presented within the report. I have asked my officials in the Office of Public Works to ensure the report is completed on time in order that early consideration can be given to its findings. In terms of immediate action I can confirm that the consultants have been asked to produce a report within seven days setting out immediate works that could be carried out without prejudice to the findings of the full report. These immediate measures could include raising walls, relocating footbridges and the use of demountable defences and early warning systems.Pending this report, the Office of Public Works is also assisting the city council in dealing with damage to walls and river banks. Office of Public Works staff were mobilised at the weekend at the request of the city engineer to deal with the collapse of the river bank at Tolka Road. The city council is rightfully taking the lead in dealing with these matters and the Office of Public Works will assist in whatever way it can.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this item and the Minister of State for his presence at this debate. When we look at the Estimates for the coming year, we see that the Minister of State has reduced the forestry allocation by 22%. In the short period he has been in the job he has effectively wrecked the ten year plan that was in place for growing for the future, implemented, oddly enough, by a fellow countyman of the Minister of State, former Minister Ivan Yates. Mr. Yates was followed very successfully by another countyman of the Minister of State, the previous Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, during the lifetime of the last Government. I call on the Minister of State to reverse this decision.The irony is that I cannot see where any saving will be made. Half of the €11 million allocation would be directly returned from Europe to the Government. In addition, many people employed in the industry face the loss of their jobs. Around 17,000 people cannot be guaranteed the contractual work they are accustomed to from February and many others who service the industry will lose out. On the border between County Clare and County Galway, between 50 and 60 people will lose their jobs in February. Coillte, now a minor player in forestry, and the seven private companies also face serious job losses. The nurseries will see their three year plan destroyed by this decision unless the Minister reverses this cut.This is economics gone wrong. The figures are plain to see. There will be a loss of premia coming from Europe. Farmers in marginal areas will have to reassess their work practices. Many of them had taken the land they intended to plant out of the REPS and extensification schemes and will find it difficult to re-enter it. In the five months since taking office, the Minister has ruined a ten year plan. He must make the decision if he is to safeguard jobs in areas where alternative employment is almost impossible to find. The experience of those who will be made redundant cannot be replaced once it is lost. Once they are displaced they will find it difficult to return to work in the future and they will be replaced by younger, less experienced workers. If the Minister fails to give an undertaking to reverse the decision, he is taking a serious step towards the dismantling of any strategy for forestry.Only 10% of the country is covered by forest and the ratio of private planting to State forestry is 3:1. Many land owners who have planned for forestry have lost out. I ask the Minister to return the 22% in the interests of the people who have shown commitment to the land, resources and the personnel involved.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I assure this House that this Government is fully committed, as articulated in repeated programmes for Government, to the long-term development of the forestry sector in Ireland. I am aware that there is concern in the industry following the publication of the Book of Estimates last week but the House will be aware that the Government is facing very difficult choices in the area of public finances and is not in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as it would wish. I am satisfied, however, that there will be no major job losses in the industry, as is being predicted.Under the national development plan expenditure of over €900 million has been designated for the forestry sector. This demonstrates the commitment the Government has to both the medium and long-term development of the forestry sector in Ireland.Over the last six years alone expenditure has exceeded €540 million, an average annual spend of €90 million, which is not far removed from the allocation of €82.5 million for next year. This allocation, therefore, has to be seen not only in the context of the general budgetary situation but also of the very considerable expenditure over recent years and the forestry commitment in the national development plan.Under this Government expenditure in forestry has geared up significantly with a projected outturn this year above of almost €107 million. The Government is committed also to the sustainable development of our forests. As the House is aware, the national climate changes strategy identifies the key role to be played under the Kyoto Protocol. The strategy calls for an intensification of the afforestation programme in view of the ongoing importance of enhancing sinks capacity towards reducing overall greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The strategy has set a target for forests to contribute 6% to the proposed reductions in emissions and a viable afforestation programme over a sustained period is essential if the target is to be met.The impact of forestry has to be looked at also in terms not only of creating the conditions necessary to increase sustainable development but also of contributing to the maintenance of the maximum number of viable farm households and of the wider rural economy. Forestry has the potential to create employment, often in remote rural areas where opportunities are limited. The main message is that forestry, particularly farm forestry, has a future and can contribute in a real way to our economic, social and environmental well being as a nation.I want to reassure the House that there is absolutely no question of any cuts in grant and premium levels. These remain unchanged. Indeed, the House will be aware that this Government secured increases of over 30% in the 2000 grant and premium levels. The Government also secured a commitment that the level of grants and premiums will be looked at as part of the mid-term review of the rural development plan and Commission approval can be sought for further increases in financial incentives for afforestation to take effect from 2004.I am confident that, on the basis of the allocation provided, we will achieve a viable planting programme in 2003 and to that end I met today with representatives of the forestry sector and the IFA to work out how best we can together achieve this objective.I again reassure the House that the Government remains fully convinced of the long-term value of the forestry programme in terms of rural development, strong and sustainable employment, import substitution and the environment. The Government's performance and delivery over the past five years is a matter of record and with the support of the forestry sector I am confident that we will achieve a viable planting programme in 2003.The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 November 2002.
