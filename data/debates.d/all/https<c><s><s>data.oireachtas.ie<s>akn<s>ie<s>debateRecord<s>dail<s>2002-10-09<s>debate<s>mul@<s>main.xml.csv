#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.My Department has three Bills awaiting Second Stage. These are the Interpretation Bill, 2000, the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill, 2002, and the Statute Law Restatement Bill, 2000. I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I notice that the legislative programme includes a national tourism development authority Bill. In view of the looming crisis in the Northern Ireland peace process and the possible suspension of the institutions, how will that impact in the context of this Bill?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	That matter does not arise now.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It does, Sir, in that it is a cross-Border activity. It is a national tourism development authority Bill.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Sorry, Deputy, the question to the Taoiseach is specifically about his  Department's legislative programme for the remainder of 2002.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Yes, and the Taoiseach will have a direct input into this.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	6	That may well be but it does not arise under the question to the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	7	With respect, Sir, when the Taoiseach travels to London tonight—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I suggest the Deputy submit a question on that specific issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I beg to differ with you, Sir, because the national tourism Bill is one that has the support of both Governments and there are implications for this in other areas.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Chair has ruled on the matter. The Deputy will have to find another way of raising it. I call Deputy Howlin.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	11	May I ask another question?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Yes, if it is appropriate to the question on the Order Paper.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The disabilities Bill had to be withdrawn on a previous occasion because rights for the disabled were not recognised in that legislation. Will the Bill which is to be published be a rights based Bill? Will the short-sighted proposals contained in the previous Bill be removed from the Bill which is to be published?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That question does not arise either. However, on the Order of Business I will allow the Deputy to ask a specific question on the Disabilities Bill when the time comes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In view of your admonition of my colleague I will confine myself to legislation that pertains to the Department of the Taoiseach. The Interpretation Bill and the Statute Law Restatement Bill were published two years ago. On the legislative priority list published for this session, neither of them features in a prioritised way. The National Economic and Social Development Office Bill, 2002, which one would imagine should have some urgency, is published and is awaiting Second Stage. I ask the Taoiseach why Bills that have been published for two years remain unmoved in this House. Has the Taoiseach plans to prioritise the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill, 2002, in particular so that it can be debated in this session?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	16	If time permits I would like to see all three Bills addressed but there is an enormous amount of legislation to be processed. However, this is not holding things up, work is going ahead anyway. The purpose of the Statute Law Restatement Bill, 2000, is to confer upon the  Attorney General power to make more readable versions of statutes available in printed or electronic form. As the House is aware, work is going ahead on that and the CD Roms have been put together, but legislative effect must be given to this.The practical objective of the legislation, and the whole system, is to relieve the user of the Statute Book of the necessity to consult a number of volumes of statutes. Users will not have to go through all the old volumes and will be able to deal just with the current state of law in a particular area. This work is going on but it would be helpful to get the legislation passed because it underpins this effort.The Interpretation Bill is related and its purpose is to simplify the reading of statute law by deleting large amounts of standard principles in interpretation. It eliminates the need for standard interpretation provisions and definitions, as set out extensively in every new Act. It would make life easier not only for people in this House but for anybody required to examine legislation. Again, the work is going ahead.The third Bill, as Deputy Howlin correctly points out, relates to the social partnership area. I would like to get this passed at an early date. All the work is going on anyway without legislation. The Bill is designed to bring together the NESC, the NESF and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. They have been working together since 22 October last – almost a year – on a non-statutory basis, but as we lead into a framework for a new national agreement it would be helpful to pass this Bill. It is not essential right now but I would like to see it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	17	In view of the imminence of a new social partnership, certainly in discussion terms, the pressures that are on social partnership and the value of social partnership, will the Taoiseach acknowledge his commitment to the concept of social partnership and that bringing the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill to the House would give the House an opportunity to discuss the success of social partnership to date and make the changes required to ensure social partnership exists into the future?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The answer is yes to both questions. I readily take the invitation to lend my ongoing support to the whole concept of social partnership. Its value is evident. I know not everybody agrees on its value – I am aware of at least one Deputy in the House who does not agree –  but it is carrying out its role as set out. Its functions have been changed with each new national programme but it certainly has fulfilled its objective and, I hope, will continue to do so as we move on into the next round. The proposed legislation emerged from the PPF. The Government and the social partners agreed that a new framework was required for further improvement of enterprise partnership, organising capability  and performance, and that the three organisations would continue to be separate but would work together in the same offices, share facilities and services where necessary and use their staff resources from each section. Working in the one area and one centre would prevent duplication of effort and the legislation is worthy of support.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Will the Taoiseach's Department have an input into the National Finance Agency Bill in view of his direct and personal interest in the provision of a national stadium?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In drawing up legislation each Department is consulted and offers its comments and observations on it, even though it may not be directly involved. This is a Finance Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.The bodies under the aegis of my Department are: the National Statistics Board, the National Economic and Social Council – NESC, the National Economic and Social Forum – NESF, the Information Society Commission, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance – NCPP, and the Law Reform Commission.In addition, the National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) Bill provides for the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office, amalgamating NESC, NESF and NCPP. There have been no appointments made to these bodies by me since 17 April 2002.Regarding committees, the new chairman of the Financial Services Ireland, Mr. William Slattery, has joined the IFSC Clearing House Group and Mr. Ian Clancy, chairman of the Dublin International Insurance and Managers Association, has joined the IFSC Insurance Working Group.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I am aware a tradition existed over many Governments whereby appointments were made in the interregnum period between a Government leaving office and a new Government taking up office. My understanding is that the previous Government appointed up to 60 people in its final days. Is it not the case that members of the public become very cynical about appointments made under these circumstances? First, will the Taoiseach consider the setting up  of an appointments commission to deal with such appointments or does he intend to introduce a regulation whereby no appointments would take place in the interregnum periods between Governments leaving and taking up office? Second, if any tribunal finds that a person appointed to a State position is guilty of improper conduct—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That does not arise.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	—will that person be removed from any such board?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	25	On the first part of the question, I reiterate that I followed good practice because it did not arise. I have not appointed anybody since 17 April. It is not a good idea to appoint people in the interregnum period between Governments – I have answered that question previously in the House – and I declined to do so when I was in the Department of Finance some years ago. It has its own difficulties, unless it is not an overly important committee or an area of major necessity. I agree with the Deputy that the idea which has developed over the years – and I will not put on the record who scored best in that regard because there were some very high scores – is not a good one.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Taoiseach's former special adviser has been appointed as a trustee of the Abbey Theatre in recent weeks. Did the Taoiseach have any influence or involvement in that or did he know about it before the appointment was made?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I have to plead ignorance on this one. Which former trusted adviser?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Mr. Paddy Duffy. I understand he was a former special adviser to the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	He was, along with some other eminent people. No, I had no part in the appointment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I did not hear the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	31	No. The Deputy has told me something I did not know.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Notwithstanding that the Taoiseach had nothing to report to us today on the nomination to State bodies under his aegis, will he agree that the process of establishing the composition of the boards of State and semi-State companies and other State agencies should be democratised?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	33	That matter does not arise under Questions Nos. 4 or 5.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	34	It does in the sense that many ordinary people believe that a strong element of cronyism is involved.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Deputy must find a way of raising the matter. It does not arise on Questions Nos. 4 and 5 which deal with appointments since 17 April.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I am asking the Taoiseach if he has ended the system of cronyism in regard to appointments to boards and democratised the process?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising these questions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.The number of staff in my Department allocated to deal with requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act, in addition to their normal duties, is 14 key decision makers across the divisions in my Department, who are mainly at assistant principal level; one higher executive officer who is the freedom of information liaison officer and who is responsible for receiving and monitoring requests and co-ordination generally of requirements under the Act as they relate to my Department; and two assistant secretaries and four principal officers who are responsible for the internal review process.A total of 32 requests under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, were received in my Department from 1 June to 4 October 2002. Of these, a decision was taken to grant the request in two cases and to part grant in two cases. In the remaining cases, no records were held in respect of seven cases, four cases were refused, three cases were transferred to other Departments, two cases were withdrawn and there are 12 cases ongoing.Requests received in the Department are processed in accordance with the Act. The implementation of the Act in my Department is kept under review on an ongoing basis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Prior to the last election the Government confirmed in writing that there were no plans to introduce any cutbacks – public, secret or any other kind. The public finances subsequently became derailed and a leaked document found its way into the public domain which indicated a requirement for cutbacks of €900 million. As we approach the decision on the Nice treaty on 19 October, it is perfectly obvious—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Does the Deputy have a question relevant to Question No. 6 or 7?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I am coming to the question. It is perfectly obvious that the attitude of the public at large has changed due to confusion about the public finances.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The question refers specifically to the Freedom of Information Act. Does the Deputy have an appropriate question?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have. On 24 September each member of the Fine Gael Front Bench wrote to his or her opposite number requesting, under the Freedom of Information Act, that the spending profiles of each Department from January 2001 be made available so that spending projections and indications of where Exchequer spending went off the rails would come to light. Only acknowledgements have been received to date. Two weeks after the request was made, and less than ten days before the decision on Nice, may I suggest to the Taoiseach that this information be made available so that the public may know the truth.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The question that the Deputy asked refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	45	If people are seeking information under freedom of information rules it will be there, but in order to be helpful to the Deputy I refer his Front Bench spokesperson on finance to the documents announced by officials at the press conference last week on the nine month returns. The profiles of each month's expenditure can be seen and it will be quite clear that nobody misled anyone. All of the efforts were directed towards bringing public expenditure back to the 14% outlined to this House on the first Wednesday of last December. This has been fulfilled totally and completely in the Revised Estimates published last February. If anybody was to examine those documents he or she would see that this information was totally in the public domain.I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that his finance spokesperson should also look at the full document pertaining to the growth and stability pact which was also put before the House on the first Wednesday of last December. That document showed the figures for this year, last year and next year and was used extensively by members of his party during Question Time this spring. They have clearly forgotten that they used those figures.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The point at issue is that the public mind is certainly confused about the state of the public finances and this has been exacerbated by a leaked document that found its way into the public domain. I would have expected the Taoiseach, as Head of Government and leader of the country, and in the public interest, to instruct all  Ministers to issue to the Deputies the information requested under the Freedom of Information Act. I am disappointed in that reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Since I last reported to the House on 26 June regarding the work of the reconstituted cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, the team has met on three occasions. As the revised title suggests, the remit has been expanded to include housing, which was previously dealt with by a separate Cabinet committee and team. The cross-departmental team has been giving consideration to the housing issue as well as continuing to focus on the key infrastructure priorities of roads and public transport, especially in the greater Dublin region. The national development plan is now nearing the end of its third year of implementation. Excellent progress has been made so far, especially in regard to the scale and nature of accumulated infrastructural deficits the plan was designed to tackle. The emphasis now must be on maintaining an appropriate momentum on the NDP infrastructure objectives over the remaining lifetime of the plan. That momentum will need to be aligned with the many other national development objectives the Government is pursuing.Over the coming months the team will continue to consider the issues involved, particularly in light of a number of studies at or near completion, most notably, in regard to roads, public transport and housing. Funding issues are receiving attention and will continue to receive attention in the context of the ongoing process of framing options and proposals for Budget 2003.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I know this is an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Taoiseach's Department. In that context is there any intention of using funds from the National Pension Reserve Fund for key infrastructural projects? Second, will the Taoiseach indicate whether it will be capable of completing the national development plan and why there is such public disquiet about certain projects being shelved and certain projects being dropped? Third, has the committee examined and made progress on the question of public private partnerships for major projects? In view of the failure of the public private partnership scheme to operate effectively in the past five years, why is it now being promoted so strongly?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	49	On the first question, the National Pension Reserve Fund has statutory independence. It would be desirable if it invested some of its resources—
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	50	It lost half a billion euro so far this year.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	51	—in the infrastructural programme. However, it must be based on its assessment and the return for the fund. Perhaps the National Development Finance Agency will help to stimulate interest in this regard. It is a matter for the fund to make its own judgments. It is completely independent of the Minister for Finance, the Government and this House in making commercial decisions because it must protect its money and the people's money.I have been saying for approximately the past year and a half that it will be difficult to fulfil all the projects within the national development plan. However, reflecting the importance the Government attaches to infrastructure investment, particularly from a competitive perspective and coming from the current base, the provision for the national roads network over the period 2000-02, for example, has exceeded the forecasts of the national development plan by more than 10%. In real terms this represents a very high level. However, we have not got the same in capacity terms because of construction price inflation about which we have spoken on many occasions, planning delays, the land difficulties which took months to resolve, capacity constraints and Exchequer funding shortfalls. For these reasons as many projects as we would have liked have not been delivered. While there has been a diminished unit of output per euro of investment relative to the original planned output we hope that will improve. This year there is a considerable easing of capacity constraints and a significant moderation of construction price inflation which will give a good opportunity to achieve better value for money compared to last year and the previous year.On the third question, the NRA is looking at many options to see how it can best use public private partnerships to move forward some of the existing projects. Given the efforts of the Minister for Transport, I hope new projects and ideas will be found. However, I do not think it is feasible that all the projects will be fulfilled within the timescale.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Is it not a fact that the national development plan has been grossly underestimated in terms of cost? Is it not a fact that the National Roads Authority has already said openly that a long list of projects that were due to be completed, or certainly commenced, in the next five years will not now commence? What is the position, in so far as the Minister for Transport's statement is concerned, on the bringing in of major international contractors to build large sections of roadway? Do the costs envisaged in the national development plan take that into account? This is being opposed strongly by business in Ireland.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	53	There are many projects in the pipeline. That is good because one of the functions of the committee and the Ministers and officials who serve on it is to gear up the State agencies and statutory bodies and to be in a position to have the planning, land acquisition and technical work done so that, as resources become available, projects can be commenced. That has proven to be very beneficial. It would be nice if there were considerable resources so we could start on projects as soon as they are finished the preparatory work. That is less realistic than it was a few years ago.The NRA is still spending more than €1 billion per year on road construction and there are 28 major to significant projects under construction. That is an enormous amount of money. This year, large amounts of money are available for planning and design. That is helping the work that is taking place. As I said, the NRA has said it will find it difficult to complete all the projects. I accept that, but taking account of public private partnerships on some of the roads, perhaps we will be able to use the National Development Finance Agency to finance more projects in the future.The difficulties that were encountered from 2000 to 2002, which was the first period of the plan, were not due to the inadequate release of funds but to a diminished unit of output per euro of investment relative to the original planned output. Deputy Kenny is correct in saying the figures were higher than we envisaged. They were higher because of construction price inflation. As Deputy Howlin well remembers, he pressurised me continually, and rightly so, to come to a conclusion on the land issue. We did, but at an excessive price, which put a fair hole in the budget. We are lucky it took only a year given the kind of money that people were seeking for their lands. Other capacity constraints and non-Exchequer funding shortfall comprised the reasons. We all know the tender prices for the past few years were exorbitant and that they were higher than we expected. That has moderated dramatically, which allows us to obtain better value for money.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Arising from the Taoiseach's responses, and trying to cut through all the jargon and verbiage we have heard, I have a number of related and direct questions. In respect of the National Pension Reserve Fund, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that we are now borrowing €1.5 billion and paying top dollar to borrow money to invest in the stock markets in a period of collapse and that we have lost half a billion euro in the process this year?Is it not a fact that the roads programme is now €6.8 billion greater than the target required to build the roads proposed in the national development plan? Is the Taoiseach aware that in its report to Government the expert high level com mittee which monitors the plan expressed shock at how wrong the budget projections were?My next point concerns the 14 roads projects. The Minister for Transport has said it cannot be funded from the moneys available to him. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that these projects will be funded and, if so, will he indicate how?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The board established under the national pensions legislation is independent and I cannot answer for its decisions.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The board will make its investment decisions in line with the provisions of the legislation and it will undertake its functions as prudently as possible. We cannot interfere with the board.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	58	That is bizarre.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It is not bizarre. We passed the legislation and I recall the Deputy agreed with it. At present a sum of €2.488 billion is being spent. This compares with the NDP forecast of €2.224 billion. It is a very high level of expenditure and it means that more than €1 billion is being spent on roads. More than 200 kilometres of top quality roads are under construction.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	60	What about the shortfall of €6.8 billion?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	61	That would arise if all the projects were to be completed at the same time. That is not realistic.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	62	That is the shortfall.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It would be impossible to commence every road plan in the NDP at the same time. At present, expenditure on roads is at historically high levels. During the past three years of the NDP, perhaps for an even longer period, construction price inflation, planning delays, capacity constraints and non-Exchequer funding shortfalls meant the road programme was not providing the envisaged value for money. At present there is a significant easing of capacity constraints and a moderation in construction activity. In view of this, while I do not anticipate that all projects will be completed within the time period envisaged under the NDP, we will secure better value for money. That is what the committee, the NRA and other bodies involved in implementing the plan are doing.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	64	What about the 14 projects to which I have referred?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Taoiseach has indicated that not all the projects envisaged under the NDP  will be completed and that there will be over-runs as a result of construction inflation. Will he agree that many projects are over-running in terms of budget because the figures used in the NDP are inadequate? For example, when it was planned initially, the Dublin port tunnel was to have been a single bore tunnel with single carriageway whereas it will be completed as a double bore tunnel with a dual carriageway. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the cross-departmental team has obtained revised figures for the projects involving roads, public transport and housing and, if so, will he provide them to the House? Will he indicate if anyone in the cross-departmental team has met the pension fund board and asked it to consider the feasibility of it funding the projects under the NDP?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I did not indicate that project delays under the NDP were solely the result of construction price inflation, I outlined a number of other reasons. An additional 10% of the total moneys envisaged under the NDP will be spent on new projects in addition to those that have already been outlined. When the national pensions fund legislation was debated the hope was expressed that it would invest in projects that would provide a commercial return, in keeping with its remit. Many financial articles and journals expressed the same wish. The board will not invest its funding in what it considers to be loss leaders. Stock market fluctuations will always occur and it is for the board to seek to reverse losses sustained there.As I chair this committee I do not wish to go into the details of individual projects. However, with regard to the port tunnel, design changes were necessary because a decade and a half elapsed from the time the project was first mooted to when it actually began. Planning and development, design issues, traffic flow and all the other aspects add to the cost over such a prolonged period.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	68	That happens in many of these projects. Without talking about any particular project, it is one of the issues addressed in the national development plan. Many of the projects fulfilled through the national development plan are ones first mooted back in the 1950s or 1960s where land was held for development and they could not be undertaken at the time. We have been able to address many of them only in the past three years. The sites required for many of the current projects, as well as those which have been completed, were bought a quarter of a century ago or more. It is to the credit of the work of those involved in the national development plan and to the resources they have used that we have been able to move on these projects that were on hold for over a generation or more.

It has absolutely shocked people, not only in this Chamber but throughout the State. What methodology will be used to determine the works which will be deferred in the event of consideration being given to a contraction of works to be undertaken in the coming year? Does the Taoiseach recognise that there is great concern, particularly in the provinces, that committed essential works along key arteries such as the N2 and N3 might suffer in any reconfiguration of the works committed? I refer specifically to bypasses of key towns such as Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan as well as Virginia, Cavan and Belturbet in County Cavan.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The intention is that all the projects in the national development plan will be completed. The NRA will have to prioritise and complete them as resources allow. We are spending three times more money now than we did a few years ago on road construction. As resources become available the NRA will roll out the contracts and look at imaginative ways for public private partnerships.The Minister for Transport is involved in this and I hope the new National Development Finance Agency will also assist. It will take over responsibility for the public private partnership unit of the Department of Finance.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Has the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnership taken on board the serious concern of many taxpayers that they will fund the major portion of the bill for these joint infrastructural developments and take the major risk while the private capitalists will take the cream with none of the risk in many cases? I believe that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will become known as the Minister for privatisation for however long the Government will be in office.Does the Taoiseach agree that the major example of a public private partnership, the West-Link toll bridge, is an absolute disaster? It  is highly profitable for the private company that runs it but hugely expensive for working people on their way to work.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	77	A brief question, please, Deputy Higgins.

Is the extension of road tolling on a public private partnership basis fundamental to Government policy for all new key roads?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The last part of the supplementary question does not arise from the original question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	80	It does.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It does not.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	82	It is relevant in so far as the 14 new road projects come under public private partnership and how that concept will be implemented in terms of policy.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It is not a question of the taxpayer or the State carrying the risk in public private partnership because the concept is that the risk is transferred to and borne by the private sector whatever the terms negotiated. Perhaps those terms may not always be as good as one would like, but it is not the case that the arrangement is for all the risk to be borne by the State and none by the private sector.Tolling is one of the options the National Roads Authority will examine for some roads. While I accept there are design problems with the West Link toll bridge on the M50 over the Liffey Valley, with which the Deputy is familiar, a fair presentation must be made. That was built by the private sector as was the East Link toll bridge. It cannot be said, as the Deputy did, that without the tolls people could drive across without hindrance. If the tolls did not exist, they could not drive across because there would not be a road. That is the way it must be presented.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	84	County councils could have built such roads.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	85	They did not.

The fact remains they did not. We are endeavouring to avoid proceeding as we did previously and, instead, to find imaginative ways of building roads.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	88	While I accept the Taoiseach's point that many of these projects were designed in the 1950s, does he not agree that we should have examined raising the height of the Dublin  Port Tunnel from that which would accommodate lorries from the 1950s? Is it not the case that the Government is providing the funding committed under the national development plan but that projects are not being delivered because the figures have not been revised? Have the figures for the implementation of the NDP been revised and will the Taoiseach furnish them to the House? Is it the case that no one from the Government has approached the board of the National Pension Reserve Fund to see if it will involve itself in public private partnerships? Is it not also the case that the NRA has shelved all but 13 of its road projects due to inadequate funding?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Regarding the updating of the figures for costs, if the Deputy tables a question to the relevant Minister, he will receive the relevant information. The NRA would certainly be revising its figures.I accept what the Deputy said about design issues and changes. I have heard the arguments about trucks in the context of the port tunnel. I have had to live with heavy goods traffic every day, as has Deputy Richard Bruton, who lives in the same area. Trucks should be reduced in size, not the tunnel increased in height. The argument has been made that trucks are increasing in size because they are becoming more efficient. As far as I am concerned, if they are reduced in size they can use the port tunnel. Already 98% can use the tunnel; the other 2% will have to conform. The height of the tunnel should not be used as an excuse for that 2% to continue to use the public roads as if it were their right to do so.The pension fund is a matter for the board of the fund. It is aware of this matter and is anxious to invest in projects of a significant size. However, the decision is a matter for the board.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Nally report contained two recommendations specifically relating to the re-organisation of the Chief State Solicitor's Office. One recommended that, subject to agreement on adequate staffing levels and appropriate staff structures, the criminal division of the CSSO should be transferred to the Office of the Direc tor of Public Prosecutions to form a unit headed by a solicitor to the DPP, with statutory clarification that its professional staff would be professional staff of the DPP within the meaning of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.The second recommended that responsibility for the local State solicitors should be transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP, with legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate to them.Following intensive negotiations with staff interests, agreement was reached on the transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The formal transfer took place on 3 December 2001 and in January of this year the staff involved moved into new premises at Upper Abbey Street, Dublin 1.The transfer of responsibility for the State solicitor service will require legislation and my Department is in discussions with the Department of Finance with a view to advancing this.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	96	There is an overall staff of several hundred. During the negotiations an increase of 75 was agreed, including 66 in the professional and technical staffing complement in both solicitors' offices. The recruitment campaign has commenced and some, if not most, of the staff are already employed. There were confined competitions for serving contract staff who were already working in the area. Some 52 additional professional members of staff were appointed in both offices. That represented a 56% increase on the existing staffing level. Some 14 additional technical members of staff were appointed. That represented a 31% increase on the existing staffing level. There were nine senior technical posts and there were other changes in grades. On the clerical side, there were changes in the number of staff officer and executive officer posts. A large increase in staff was agreed as part of the transfer of the section to the DPP along with the physical movement of the office to its new location.In answer to Deputy Howlin's question, I understand discussions on that matter have commenced. I do not think it can happen without legislation.

The provision of such services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation.I recognise there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for private investment. Accordingly, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to rectify this. In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. In July 1999, the Government entered into a contract with Global Crossing to greatly increase the levels of international connectivity between Ireland and the United States and 40 European centres. The cost of international connections from Ireland is now among the most competitive in Europe.Over €200 million has been allocated to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources under the communications and e-commerce measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services.The Government signed nine contracts with telecommunications operators in 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband infrastructure leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million.We have also made a second call for proposals and this will be incorporated in the national broadband strategy which envisages the construction of metropolitan fibre and duct networks and co-location space in a number of towns around the country. The Government is also exploring the potential of satellite and wireless-based technologies.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	101	This is my first opportunity in the House to wish the Minister well in his portfolio and I do so now.Is the Minister aware that a European Commission study ranked Ireland last out of all 15 member states in the provision of broadband infrastructure across the country? Is he aware that the ODTR recently confirmed that Eircom now has 1,714 customers for its DSL broadband service? Figures from the British body, Oftel, confirm that there are more than one million customers using the British broadband service. Does the Minister accept we are now an uncompetitive country when it comes to the provision of communications infrastructure to attract inward investment?When does the Minister intend to set up the new commission for communications regulation provided for in the Communications Regulation Act, 2002? When will he appoint up to three commissioners to that body? Does he intend to make Etain Doyle, director of the ODTR, chairperson of that commission and will that commission have enforcement powers in addition to those of the ODTR?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I accept we are starting from a fairly low base when it comes to broadband but within the general Dublin area we have very good coverage and connectivity in comparison to other European countries. It was for that reason the Government decided more than two years ago to embark on a strategy whereby broadband would be pushed out into the regions and that it would not be left up to private operators, particularly as it was suggested there might not necessarily be an economic case for pushing broadband into the regions. The Government therefore made a strategic decision somewhat similar to the broad strategy in Government policy to have balanced regional development. Quite apart from putting roads and other infrastructure into the regions, broadband connectivity is a key component that is nearly more important than roads or motorways and that is why the Government, in the national development plan, dedicated €200 million to this over the next few years. The Deputy is probably aware that one of the first contracts to be signed and on which work is to start is in Cork. It is probably one of the major contracts and involves approximately 20 initial projects under this, the second call for proposals. From that point of view this is rolling out as quickly as possible.Regarding the three-person commission, the Deputy may have seen advertisements recently in the newspapers and there has been great interest in the positions of the two additional members. No decision has been made on this. Assessment of the applications will be made by the Local Appointments Commission and when that comes forward we will make a decision.

The level of the licence fee is set from time to time by Government. Any decision on the future level of the television licence fee will be made having regard to the services that RTE will provide going forward, the cost of those services and the commercial revenues available to RTE.Since my appointment as Minister my Department has had regular meetings with RTE management in relation to the company's financial performance and outlook.

In this context my Department has made it clear to RTE that it is open to it to raise any concern it has relating to commercial and other operational constraints in the context of the application it is preparing. RTE management has welcomed this offer and has agreed to revert to the Department if necessary on this issue in the  context of a licence fee application to be submitted later this year.The existence of a strong and developing independent radio and television sector has been a positive feature of the Irish broadcasting environment in the past decade or so. Decisions on the funding of RTE cannot be taken in isolation from the wider broadcasting landscape in Ireland and this point is fully acknowledged in the report of the Broadcasting Forum. How RTE is funded and regulated will impact on the independent sector. My concern is to get the balance right and to provide for both public service and commercial broadcasting in a market environment where the rights of each party are fully respected.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I asked the Minister for the Government's response to the report of the Flood tribunal regarding the corrupt actions of former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, in relation to RTE and broadcasting and in particular regarding the direct finding of the tribunal that Mr. Burke acted to advance the private interests of the promoters of a private broadcasting company to the disadvantage of RTE. As the Minister studiously avoided answering any part of that question I will ask the question again. Does the Government accept the findings of the Flood tribunal that the former Minister, Mr. Burke, acted corruptly in relation to his responsibilities in broadcasting? Does the Government accept the findings of the Flood tribunal that Mr. Burke acted to advance the interests of a private company rather than the public interest and has the Government made an assessment of the impact of those decisions on the finances and commercial viability of RTE? Has the Government considered the possibility that those affected by the corrupt actions of Mr. Burke, employees who lost jobs or companies which lost contracts, may take legal action against the State arising from the findings of that tribunal?

Since publication of the tribunal report my officials have requested RTE to make a submission in relation to any issues flowing from that report.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	117	We have asked RTE, since the publication of the Flood tribunal report, to indicate any areas of concern it has in that regard in connection with any future licence fee application.Century Radio was up and running for two years. The Deputy's question implies a financial loss but it is up to RTE to indicate to me whether it incurred a financial loss as a result of decisions made.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	118	The dogs in the street know there was a financial loss.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	119	It is a fact that the decision made at that time has led to an independent broadcasting sector which is very vibrant, particularly in the radio sector. Regarding any adverse effect the Flood tribunal report findings had on RTE, I have asked RTE to bring forward its views in the context of a licence fee application to be made in the near future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I am not asking the Minister about RTE's response. I am asking for his response to the finding by a tribunal established by this House that a predecessor of his acted corruptly and acted to promote the interests of a private company to the disadvantage of, and against, the public interest. As the Minister responsible for this issue, I again ask Deputy Ahern to outline his response to that finding of the tribunal. Do the Minister and the Government accept the finding of the tribunal?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The time is concluded.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It goes without saying that the Government and I accept the findings of the Flood tribunal report. If there was a financial loss to RTE over the period in which Century was in operation, we asked RTE to indicate to us the nature of that loss.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The Minister's officials indicated that at the time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	125	No. It is up to RTE to indicate to us whether it suffered a financial loss and that issue will then be examined.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Deputy will be aware that the Forum on Broadcasting established in March of this year submitted its report to me in mid August. The forum was asked to consider the future of broadcasting in Ireland. The forum recommended that RTE's role as the designated public service broadcaster should be re-affirmed.I sought comments on the report from interested parties by the end of September. I am  considering the recommendations of the forum along with the submissions I have received. Later this year I will outline how I intend to proceed regarding the forum's recommendations. At this point I can say that I am of the view that the people of Ireland are likely to be best served by a broadcasting sector that includes RTE as a strong national public service broadcaster with a broad remit that is clearly defined.As regards how RTE should be funded in the future, I agree with the forum's recommendation that it should continue to be dual funded, receiving moneys from the proceeds of the television licence fee along with commercial revenue. As to the actual level of the licence fee, any application from RTE for an increase in the licence fee will be considered on its merits when received. Clearly, however, RTE must account in an open and transparent fashion regarding its use of the significant public moneys made available to it.The forum's report also included a number of significant recommendations that impact directly or indirectly on the question of the funding of RTE. These include the recommendation that RTE should operate on the basis of a charter and the recommendation that there should be a single content regulator. I intend to take decisions on how to proceed regarding these recommendations before taking a decision on the actual level of the television licence fee.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	127	In light of Deputy Gilmore's question on the funding of RTE, why did the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, decide to limit RTE's radio advertising time to 7.5 minutes per hour while allowing commercial radio stations to use nine minutes per hour, a limit which still applies? Does the Minister plan to reverse this decision and allow RTE to be competitive in its ability to raise advertising revenue? Does he intend to implement in full the recommendations of the Forum on Broadcasting? Will he set up a national broadcasting authority as recommended by the forum? For many people the most significant broadcasting issue at present is that of free-to-view television coverage of key events. Will the Minister outline in detail the current state of his discussions regarding this issue with the FAI, BSkyB, RTE and other sporting bodies?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I will be answering a subsequent question on this subject. One of the measures taken by the then Minister, Mr. Burke, still remains in place. This issue involves the amount of time during which RTE, as opposed to the independent broadcasting sector, can broadcast advertising in any one period. This issue is being discussed regarding the licence fee application. We have invited RTE to indicate its position to us, particularly in view of the findings of the Flood tribunal report.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Does the Minister have a view as to why the decision was taken?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	130	It was an effort to develop the independent radio and television sector and it has worked. The independent sector would have a view about any tampering with that at present, particularly in view of the fact that RTE is the recipient of substantial funds from the taxpayer, whereas the independent sector is not.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	131	What is the Minister's view on the television licence fee? Has he any plans to ensure that the collection of that fee can be done in a more efficient manner? Will he tell the House what percentage of television users do not pay the television licence fee? Is the Minister sympathetic to the submission made by the Irish Hard of Hearing Association which rightly demands that realistic, but ambitious, targets be set for the use of subtitling in public service broadcasting?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The latter issue is very much to the fore in the discussions we undertake with RTE. I did not answer the Deputy's earlier question about whether the Government accepts the recommendations of the forum report. As I indicated earlier, we had planned to allow for a short period of consultation up to the end of September. We have received most of the submissions and we will be making decisions on the recommendations of the forum over the next few months. It will all be linked into any possible application by RTE regarding the licence fee.There have been detailed discussions between my Department, An Post and RTE regarding the collection of the licence fee. I do not have information on the percentage level of non-payment but it is relatively high – in fact it is very high.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	133	It is 40%.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	134	RTE and An Post may disagree on the figure. We are examining this issue to see if there is a better method of collection of the fee if slippage is occurring.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Before we proceed to the next question, I note that a Deputy was offering to speak. I wish to remind the House that, during Priority Questions, supplementary questions are confined to the Members in whose names they are submitted.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I concluded the consultation process last week. Having regard to the criteria set out in the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999, and the submissions made, I brought a memorandum to Government on the issue.Having regard to ongoing negotiations with the FAI and the meeting scheduled for tomorrow between the Government and representatives of the FAI, it was decided today to defer a final decision on that memorandum. This will allow negotiations between the Government and the FAI to proceed with a view to a swift resolution to this matter.From the outset I have endeavoured to ensure that the home qualifying matches for the European Championships and the World Cup will continue to be available on free television services. Since the Government decision in late July to commence the listing process, I have met personally with the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA. My officials have held further meetings with these sports bodies and with the International Rugby Board and the Association of Irish Racecourses. I have received written comments from the public and via an on-line forum on the Department's website on the preliminary designated events list. I have sought the views of sports bodies and broadcasters on the preliminary list. I hosted a public meeting in Dublin and concluded the process by once again meeting with the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and the Irish Sports Council. Let me reiterate that the Government and I are determined to ensure that key sporting events are available on free television services.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Will the Minister confirm that the Irish people will not be able to see Ireland's home game against Switzerland on live television next Wednesday unless they have paid a subscription to Sky Sports? Will he accept that this is the case because of the Government's failure to designate sporting events since the legislation was enacted in 1999? Will he tell the House when the designation of the events will take place? Can the Minister confirm that the designation will require the approval of this House? When will he bring the required motion before the House? Can he confirm that the World Cup qualifying series will be included in the designation?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I think the Deputy is referring to the European Championships and not the World Cup.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Yes.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The issue of designation came to the fore very soon after I became Minister and we moved very quickly to bring forward a preliminary list. As I said, we had very detailed discussions with the organisations and they have a  particular on it. I brought forward a memorandum to Government today. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, will meet the FAI tomorrow with a view to discussing this and other issues. A decision will be made shortly thereafter in relation to the memorandum.Whether the first home game on 16 October will be transmitted on free-to-air television is not within the remit of the Government but I assure the Deputy that over recent months we have made significant contact with all the interested parties with a view to ensuring that the first game would be televised on free-to-air television. Unfortunately, as of this moment those discussions, despite our exhortations, have not proved fruitful. We thought that perhaps as a gesture it would be free-to-air.On the question of subsequent games, the next home game is in June of next year. I hope that the issue of designation is resolved long before that date. Once I have made a decision, I will get Government approval to bring forward an order to be tabled in the House, which is the next step. Subsequently, we must go to the EU Commission. A committee of the European Commission will decide on approval of the list proposed by this country. That has happened in the case of other countries which have already designated.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I would like to get absolute clarification on this matter. Is the Minister stating that the indication he gave publicly that the first game – Ireland v. Switzerland – this day week would be broadcast possibly on Sky One is no longer the case and that the game will not be free-to-air? Assuming the designations are made – I understand from what the Minister said it is his intention to have the designations made in time for the subsequent games – will the Minister assure the House that subsequent games in the European Championships qualifying campaign are broadcast free-to-air? 
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I did not indicate that the first game would be on free-to-air television or on Sky One. There was a report in the newspapers on that but no indication was given to us in our discussions that would be the case. I understand Sky has confirmed that in recent times which is a great pity. Be that as it may, I have a job to do and I am going to proceed along the route we indicated in July. The reason I did not bring forward the memorandum earlier was that discussions were ongoing with the various groups involved to see if an amicable solution could be found because there is a balance to be struck in all this. I said publicly that I was reluctantly becoming involved in this process because the sporting organisations have a strong view that designation will, in effect, hamstring them in relation to rights which they believe they have.On games after designation, it is our strong view that once we designate, these games will be caught and will be part of the designation. We will take whatever action is required to ensure those games are caught within the designation.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	143	My Department has an ongoing safety programme involving an appropriate combination of statutory regulation, enforcement and safety awareness promotion with the aim of achieving the highest level of safety at sea and on inland waters.In February of this year, my Department's maritime safety directorate was established. The objective was to create an efficient, effective and fully co-ordinated service ensuring that safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment receive top priority. The directorate also includes the realignment of safety functions for the marine leisure sector so that they are discharged as an integral element of maritime safety policy. Furthermore, the newly appointed director general also has overall responsibility for the Irish Coastguard service to ensure that the planning and delivery of all safety services is undertaken in a fully integrated manner.The directorate has an ongoing legislative programme involving the transposition into Irish law of EU and international safety standards for international seagoing passenger and cargo vessels and the introduction of national safety standards for domestic vessels. Among the legislation the directorate is currently working on is a comprehensive regulatory framework for fishing vessels.My Department has for a long time played a proactive role in raising awareness on safety issues. Each year a safety awareness programme is undertaken in conjunction with a number of State agencies and other bodies such as the RNLI. The marine safety working group, which comprises members of these agencies and bodies, meets regularly throughout the year to co-ordinate efforts in this regard. The maritime safety directorate will build on these activities over the next year to develop a comprehensive safety awareness programme.I have asked the maritime safety directorate to review current safety measures for small water craft focusing on the requirements to wear lifejackets, licensing requirements, enforcement and increased public awareness of safety issues. It is my intention to publish a consultation paper in the near future.I also announced recently my decision, in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to bring forward the date of commencement of the new passenger boat regulations from 6 June 2002 to 1 January 2003. All passenger boats will be required to have a licence to operate from that date. Any person found operating illegally after this date will be subject to the full rigours of the law. The overall result will be a safer regime where the public have a right to know that the boat they are on complies with safety standards. The directorate is organising a series of seminars this month to publicise the new regulations.I assure the Deputy that safety is a key priority for me and the Minister and our Department and we will continue to develop and progress initiatives aimed at protecting life at sea and on inland waters.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I welcome the last part of the reply, in particular that safety will be a priority for this Administration. Will the Minister of State confirm that the average number of deaths per year in Ireland, approximately 84, over the last 30 years is twice as high as that in the UK or Germany per capita? Will he confirm a significant increase in the number of accidental drownings in 2001 compared to 2000?I welcome the introduction of the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, 2001, making it law that all fishermen on Irish registered vessels wear lifejackets on deck. Will the Minister of State indicate whether an inspection or prosecution has taken place as a result of these regulations? Who is responsible for enforcing them, are they doing so and do they have the resources to do so?On the Merchant Shipping (Mechanically Propelled Pleasure Craft) (Safety) Regulations, 2001, with which I have some difficulty but which have, nevertheless, been put in place to prevent careless and dangerous operation of jet skis and power boats, how many prosecutions have taken place in enforcing them, who is responsible for enforcing them and do they have the necessary capacity to do so?I welcome the Minister of State's decision to insist on angling boats complying with regulations laid out under the Licensing of Passenger Boats Regulations, 2001, having previously exempted them which, with the benefit of hindsight, was an error of judgment which may have contributed to a tragedy which occurred over the summer months with which the Minister of State will be very familiar.On pleasure craft and the need to improve the standards of safety equipment, while not over- regulating this important leisure activity and industry, has the Minister of State considered using the model of the RNLI voluntary safety inspection system, referred to as the Sea Check system, and developing a structure where the  Irish Coastguard could provide such a service to Irish private boat owners who request it?
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I will get the number of prosecutions, if any have taken place. The Deputy knows the sea better than I do, but the voluntary method has not been that effective. Having witnessed at first hand the tragedy in Fethard – and I again extend sympathy to the families involved –  it was important to bring forward the legislation to January. It may be said that this was a mistake, but it was decided to give boat operators time to reach the required standards.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	146	It was a mistake by both sides of the House. We were all guilty.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	147	As soon as the Fethard tragedy occurred we acted to bring forward the regulations, which the Deputy suggested at the time should be done. Through increasing awareness and the maritime safety directive, we are working to promote as much safety as possible. Any death at sea is one too many. On foot of the new legislation, we will hold seminars around the country in places such as Galway, Killarney, Rosslare, Dublin Castle and the Mount Errigal Hotel, which I and the Minister will attend. As the Opposition spokesperson, the Deputy will be more than welcome to attend also. Legislation is important but so too is education and awareness about safety at sea.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	148	What about enforcement also?

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The provision of telecommunications services including internet services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. However, recognising that there are areas that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and  services, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland. In 1999, under the 1994-99 national development plan and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was invested to support the roll-out of broadband to the border, midlands and west region and the south and east region. In addition, a contract was entered with Global Crossing in 1999 to provide international bandwidth. Under the 2000-06 national development plan, as I indicated in replying to an earlier question, the indicative allocation for communications initiatives to leverage and accelerate investment in regional broadband was approximately €200 million.A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million.In late 2001, a second call for proposals was held and the ensuing broadband programme involves an indicative 20 projects which will lead to the construction of metropolitan area fibre optic networks in cities and towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The metro fibre network programme involves the local and regional authorities and the relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing and appropriate approvals, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the coming months and that the projects will be completed by the end of next year.Following on the Government's identification of the need for the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to the regions, the Department of Public Enterprise, as it was then, held a call for proposals for pilot projects utilising VSAT satellite technologies in diverse user communities, to assess its suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions to promote the deployment of broadband access in remote areas. My Department recently invited applications to conduct trials of wireless LAN technologies to demonstrate the feasibility of wireless broadband technology and to identify how and where it can be utilised and what constraints exists. I will announce the results later in the year.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient cabling is already in the ground to provide a DSL infrastructure for many areas? What leadership will he give to ensure that there is genuine unbundling of the local loop to ensure that there is competition in the market? Where he is not satisfied that there is sufficient cable, will he give a policy directive, as allowed by communications regulations legislation, to local authorities to set out fair conditions in a standardised way to allow companies to install cable from one region to another? Does he accept that at present the biggest obstacle for many telecommunications companies is the difficulty and cost of being granted way-leave from local authorities as there is no uniformity of approach because of a lack of direction from the Minister?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I do not accept the last assertion about a lack of direction. My Department has been working daily with local authorities. Local authorities were chosen because they were the bodies able to give access to companies in order to lay the network.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	154	It is different in every county.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	155	We are using a model that was successfully deployed in other countries, particularly Sweden, and it is working well despite teething problems. My Department has been working with the local authorities and the companies to ensure that easy access is maintained. I compliment these authorities for the way in which they have taken this project on board.As the Deputy knows, local loop unbundling is now law and the ODTR has responsibility for the implementation of that. Deputies and the public will already see the benefits of this as there is now a more fluid environment in accessing the network. Regarding the cable in the ground and connectivity, we have the Eircom network and the ESB is producing one with Government assistance, while there are other initiatives. Given that we entered the Global Crossing contract for international connectivity, Ireland will be well served in future.UTV has already offered flat rate internet access at off-peak times.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The purpose of Directive 95/21/EC on port State control is to reduce drastically and ultimately eliminate the number of substandard ships in Union waters. To this end, the directive agrees common criteria for inspecting ships which use a port of the Union. One of its key provisions lays down that each member state is to carry out an annual total number of inspections corresponding to at least 25% of the number of foreign ships entering its ports.On 26 June 2002 the Commission decided to bring an action in the European Court of Justice against France and Ireland for their failure to comply with its directive.Ireland's inspection rate has increased greatly over the past few years. Some 7.5% of foreign ships entering our ports were inspected in 1999, 14.6% in 2000 and a total of 21% of ships were inspected in 2001.A number of steps are being taken to ensure that the recently established Maritime Safety Directorate within my Department has the resources to carry out the number of inspections required under Ireland's port state control obligations. In particular, an additional ten vessel surveyors have recently been appointed to the Directorate and are currently undergoing training. The Directorate is also developing a management information system to enhance the collection of data required for improved management of our port State control operations.Port state control is a very effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and I have asked the Maritime Safety Directorate to give this work a priority. I am hopeful that we will meet the target of 25% in 2002.

Ultimately we hope the inspection rate will be up on 25%. Action is also being taken against France. The increase in Ireland from 7% in 1999 to 21% in 2001 is dramatic compared with the  improvement in France which was only 9.6% in those two years. The main source of complaint by the Commission was in regard to France, not Ireland. I do not have a note in the file to suggest as far back as September 2001 that action would be taken by the Commission but there was an indication in May 2002 where a formal notice was granted. I am not certain but there may have been a notice in December 2001 also. There may be a mistake in the briefing. During the past two years there has been a significant increase in inspections. An additional ten surveyors have been recruited and are being trained for inspections so that there will be a dramatic improvement. I hope that at the end of the year we will be able to indicate to the Commission that we have fully complied with our obligations.

I would have thought that if he is responding to the Commission, which is taking us to the European Court of Justice for our failure to comply with its directive, our performance this year would be a central part of our defence. If, as stated, it is his intention to reach the target of 25% by the end of this year will he state whether in the first nine months of the year the inspection rate is up to the target of 25% already or down on the 21% for last year? In general, how have we performed and how much more needs to be done before the end of the year to comply with the 25% target?

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Following a Government decision in July 2000, the marine tourism and leisure division was set up in my Department with the aim of promoting the sustainable and safe development of the marine tourism and leisure sector in Ireland. Since that time, the division has covered the safety regulation of the marine leisure sector and managed the Department's grant funding to a number of special marine tourism and heritage projects, most notably those involving the Dunbrody and Jeanie Johnston replica vessels. The division is also responsible for the ongoing management of a special allocation of €5.715 million, which was provided by the Government in the 2000 budget for specific flagship marine leisure projects.On a broader scale, my Department has recognised the importance of the marine tourism and leisure sector by introducing a €25.4 million marine tourism grant scheme, which is aimed at improving marine access infrastructure such as marinas, berths and slipways. The implementation of this grant scheme, which is a sub-measure of the overall NDP tourism measure 2000-06, is a very significant development as it will be the first time that my Department has taken a direct role in operating an investment programme for the marine tourism and leisure sector.The marine tourism grant scheme was formally launched by my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey, on 4 February 2002, and a number of eligible projects have been identified from the first call for applications which closed on 28 March 2002. It is intended that these projects will shortly undergo a more detailed examination by a project assessment committee, which has been established by my Department to assess all eligible projects with a view to forwarding recommendations to the Tourism Product Selection Board. This selection board has been set up by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation as the final arbiter as to which projects should receive funding through the various grant schemes implemented under the overall tourism measure. It is my intention that this assessment phase will be completed in time to allow the selection board to be in a position to approve expenditure commitments under the scheme early in 2003, when the position regarding the availability of longer term funding under the NDP will be clarified.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I am aware that at the Local Authorities Members Association Conference in Tralee in April a call was made for the establishment of a national action plan to combat coastal erosion. There are growing concerns about coastal erosion and other changes to the coast as a result of climate change and other factors and there are calls for appropriate new national strategies.I would like to explain that primary responsibility for coastal protection works rest with the property owner, be that a private individual or a local authority. However, substantial Exchequer funding has been made available for public safety, heritage and public infrastructure protection measures. Some €18.9 million has been provided by the Exchequer in the past five years and €4 million of Exchequer funds has been allocated for priority coastal protection works in 2002, the balance of 25% to be funded by the local authorities in question in accordance with standing arrangements.Recently my Department wrote to all coastal local authorities requesting proposals in order of priority for consideration in the period 2003-06. The programme of works for the period 2003-06 will depend on the Exchequer funding allocated for these years and overall national priorities. Priority will be given to projects that protect public safety, public property or infrastructure; protect areas of socio-economic, tourism or recreational importance; support the economic development or increase the economic potential of coastal regions; provide essential protection for areas or features of environmental or heritage significance; and avert the need for costly remedial works at a later stage.To inform a long-term strategy in relation to coastal erosion so as to take account of climate change and other adverse factors affecting key areas of the coast, my Department is now commencing a comprehensive coastal protection strategy study. The study will review the national coastline and its vulnerability to erosion or other change and the nature of the hinterland in social, economic and environmental terms. This will provide a firm basis for establishing national policies and coast protection priorities for a number of years ahead.

It depends on the outcome of the survey but I think it is important, given that a lot of coastal erosion relates to particular areas and not all local authorities are affected, that we have a broad view in relation to what areas are worst affected. As we unfortunately saw in recent times, it can happen in areas that perhaps have not had flooding for many a long year. From that point of view, it is high time we looked again at the overall strategy around the coast, and that is why we have asked local authorities to indicate their priorities because they know the coastline probably better than most.

What proportion of the moneys allocated has already been taken up by the local authorities concerned?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	175	In relation to the take-up, if there are moneys that have not been allocated we would obviously then move on to additional projects that had not been indicated in the first tranche. The arrangement is that there is matching funding of 25% from the local authority. In 2001 there was an unprecedented level of spending –€7.7 million – which is larger than any previous year. In the past five years, somewhere in the region of €19 million has been made available.Proposals to date for 2003 are estimated to cost €28 million. This is not to say this sum will be available, given that €7.7 million was made available in 2001. It is also necessary to prioritise.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I would like to pay tribute to the life and work of the late David Moloney, who died on 4 September aged 52 years. David served as a representative for Tipperary North from 1977 until 1981 as a Member of Seanad Éireann and until 1987 as a Member of the Dáil, before retiring from national politics to run his family business in his native Thurles. He was also a member of the local authority.David Moloney was an outspoken and imaginative speaker, a creative mind and a courageous legislator. His pursuit of issues of interest to him was both relentless and fearless. He was widely respected both inside and outside this House. Regrettably he did not have the opportunity to serve at ministerial level, having not been appointed by either of the Fitzgerald Governments in the early 1980s.He was one of eight children reared in a family where the social work of his father, the late Dr. Paddy Moloney, was quite legendary. He was involved as an innovator in the setting up of the free legal aid centres which did so much in terms of legal work for so many people. He served as director of elections for Tipperary North in 1977 and was selected at a convention in autumn 1980  to contest a by-election which resulted from the appointment of Michael O'Kennedy as Commissioner. In that convention he defeated another then member of Fine Gael, Michael Lowry.He won the 1981 election, the by-election not having been held, and served with distinction on the New Ireland Forum in 1984. He was a personal friend of mine and I regret his passing. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and all his constituents, I would like to tender our sincere sympathy and the regrets of this House to his wife Eve, his two sons Patrick and Conor, his brothers Pierce, Paddy and Martin and his sisters Eleanor, Mary and Patricia.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	178	On behalf of both myself and the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of David Moloney in early September. Born in Thurles in August 1950, he was educated in Thurles Christian Brothers' School, Coláiste na Rinne in Waterford, Copeswood College in Limerick, University College Dublin and the Law School of the Incorporated Law Society.In the early 1970s he clearly demonstrated what was a life-long interest in defending the rights of the less privileged in society with his involvement in the development of the voluntary group FLAC. He subsequently became its chairman and worked very actively in building it into a major organisation of centres. In 1973 he formed the legal firm Butler, Cunningham and Moloney and worked in the development of the family business.Elected to the Seanad in 1977, he was party spokesman on law reform, human rights and consumer affairs. He was elected to the Dáil for Tipperary North in 1981 and served as a Deputy until 1987. In 1987, as I think those of us who were here all remember, he retired from national politics and returned to his legal practice. In the recent general election, however, he was still active and working for his party as director of elections for one of the candidates and was still deeply involved. I knew David Moloney in the House at that time but did not have many dealings with him later on, though I know many people in this House continued to enjoy his friendship.He had a passionate concern for social issues which he demonstrated all his life as a Legislator, in his spare time and in his professional capacity as a lawyer. He was possessed of an easy manner which made people comfortable with him and was known to be a great listener. He never talked down to anyone, regardless of their background. He has been described as a people's lawyer, such was his concern for the rights of the small man, and he was never less than forthright about injustice. As a Member of the Oireachtas, he shone among his peers and was considered one of the most able performers in the Oireachtas at that time. He was never afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom or to put his head above the  parapet if he had a strong conviction about something. To him, principle was his guiding light.Having stood down from the Dáil, he cut short a political career to pursue his family business and to work in his legal practice. He dedicated his time more fully to his thriving legal career. Thurles, his native place, was dear to him and he had a noted love and interest in the people and its history.I join with Deputy Kenny and Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife, Eve, his sons, Patrick and Conor, and to his wider family. I extend the sympathies of the Fianna Fáil Party to them all. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

I knew David in the latter part of his political career which overlapped the start of my tenure in this House as a Senator, and I remember his performances in this House. He would have been regarded as among a new generation of able, gifted politicians earmarked to go to the top of the political system. That would have been the view from all sections of this House. It came as a surprise to many that he chose to do something quite unusual, that is, in his prime, with enormous potential politically, opt out of politics and return to his legal practice in Tipperary although he continued to be active in community and political affairs. It is important for us to have stalwarts like that who not only have political experience, but also a passion for our democratic processes.All of us were stunned to hear of David's untimely death during the recess. It underscores for all of us our own mortality. It must be a horrendous blow for his wife and his sons to endure. On behalf of Labour, I send my sympathies to them and to all his colleagues in Fine Gael, both in this House and in his constituency of Tipperary North.

When a political contemporary and a friend dies at such a young age, it deeply affects us all. I had the pleasure of knowing David Molony well. We both came into this House in 1977. In the Seanad at that time he displayed the skills of a quality politician. He was passionate and he was a conviction politician. Although he came from a rural constituency, he was very outspoken on the burning social issues of the day where he clearly would have defined himself as a liberal.When he was elected to the Dáil in 1981, he displayed the forensic skills for which he became renowned, namely, hounding the Government of  the day or proclaiming the virtues of his own party, Fine Gael, when it was in Government. Had he been in this House for a longer period, I have no doubt he would have been a very fine Minister, perhaps even a party leader and a Taoiseach. He opted out of politics but he stayed closely in touch with politics and, as Deputy Kenny said, he remained very involved with the Fine Gael Party. I met David in June of this year and it was hard to believe he was suffering from a serious illness, which I understood he had for the past number of years but which he did not discuss with anybody.On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend my sympathy to somebody who came into politics for all the right reasons. It was his great sense of public service which led him to be one of the founders of the free legal aid centres, something which is commonplace now but which was mould-breaking in its day. I am sure that encouraged him to get involved in political activity. He will be sadly missed by his wife and family, his friends, his community in north Tipperary and by the Fine Gael Party.

David Molony's untimely death was met with shock, disbelief and widespread sadness throughout Tipperary and Ireland. David had earned a reputation as one of  the leading solicitors in the country. His expertise was much sought after. Those who availed of his legal advice understand and appreciate the reason his legal practice is so successful. David had a sharp intellect and an extraordinary ability to quickly come to terms with technical detail. When he presented a legal or political point of view, it was always delivered with authority, conviction and impact.When David entered the Dáil in 1981, he was immediately recognised as someone who had exceptional ability and talent. His political awareness, innovative ideas on policy issues and parliamentary skills gained him instant recognition and huge admiration and respect across the political divide. David was very professional in his approach to everything he did. He was highly focused, motivated and organised. Ability and confidence were his hallmarks. David was also a man of great compassion who assisted countless numbers of people who found themselves in difficult circumstances. Above all, he enjoyed a very happy family life with Eve, Patrick and Conor and his loss to his family is immeasurable. David Molony was a real professional and a true gentleman.

Question Time tomorrow shall be at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the Order shall not resume thereafter.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I object to the Order of Business. This House gathers today for the first session of the autumn to discuss a report from Mr. Justice Flood which has been six years in preparation. I find it absolutely astonishing that neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste intends to answer questions at the end of this debate. The Taoiseach says he is not party to this report and that he is hardly mentioned in it, but he is absolutely central to the entire Flood report because there are questions about his judgment and leadership, the acid test of which was the appointment of Mr. Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I propose that we have a two-hour question and answer session at the end of this debate so that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste may answer questions—

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	192	A Cheann Comhairle, 100,000 people have acquired this report. They want  answers and I need to know that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will answer their questions.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I move amendment No. 1:In proposal No. 1, to delete "10.30 p.m." and substitute "12 midnight".This is a shabby proposal. Most of us in the House are astonished that the second interim report of the Flood tribunal, which has shocked the country and become a best-seller, such is the interest in it—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Deputy Howlin, proposal No. 2 deals with the arrangements for discussing the Flood tribunal report.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I have an amendment to the first item which deals with the inadequacy of the time provided. We sought, and understood that we were to get, two days of debate on this issue. We will in fact get something under six hours and, as it turns out, the Labour Party, with 21 Deputies, will get approximately two slots. That is wholly inadequate. I will keep my comments on the questioning that is required until we deal with the second item.In terms of item No. 1, I have already given notice in the name of the Labour Party Whip that we seek to amend this proposal so that we may begin the process of accountability by giving at least an extra one and a half hours tonight, up to 12 midnight. I ask that the amendment submitted by the Labour Party be accepted by the Taoiseach so that more Deputies may participate in this critical debate. The people are watching and will reconsider the relevance of this House if we cannot at least debate issues such as this and get meaningful answers from the Government. We will make ourselves irrelevant. At the end of the debate tomorrow I will seek to ensure that this other time be made up in proper questions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I add my voice to the fears that have been expressed and agree that this Order of Business is completely unacceptable and not worthy of our Parliament or the job we are here to do.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	198	We are discussing the late sitting.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Late sitting or not, this will be about as meaningful as expressions of sympathy for the Flood report. It is totally unbecoming of all the work done over the years by Mr. Justice Flood and his team for us to wring our hands at what is in that report, without looking ahead—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	200	That does not arise.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	201	It does arise when people are looking for time.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	202	We are discussing the hours of the sitting. The Deputy will have an opportunity to discuss this during proposal No. 2.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	203	We need more time and we also need the Taoiseach to answer questions to make this process meaningful.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I have had to accept your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, in relation to my request under Standing Order 31 earlier, but given the importance of the issue I wanted us to address, I would like clarification from the Taoiseach on whether he and the Government will provide time to address the very serious crisis in the peace process. I and my colleagues have a proposal, No. 48, on the Order Paper today which seeks to reaffirm support for the Good Friday Agreement and strongly opposes any suggestion of a suspension of the institutions by the British Government. I want the Taoiseach to clarify whether he will allow for discussion to take place here either on the basis of that proposal or a Government motion. The issue of the day demands it.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	205	On the question of the late sitting, we are seeing the greatest scandal since the Arms Trial, when this House sat throughout the night and on Saturdays. To suggest that we should put a time limit on this debate and have no questions and answers at the end is unacceptable and does not meet the requirements of the public. Around 100,000 people bought this report. The reason we are having tribunals at all is that questions were not answered in this House. It is imperative that the points made by Deputy Kenny be accommodated by the Taoiseach and the Government, and we will not accept anything less.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I will answer the questions.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	207	He will answer a question now.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I will answer the two questions together as it will save me repeating myself later. The reports of all previous tribunals presented to the Dáil were dealt with in a similar way. As no individual Minister is responsible for the establishment of the tribunals, no question and answer session has ever been taken. That is the precedent in the House.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	209	On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, you are allowing the Taoiseach to answer a question you would not allow.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Deputy Howlin, I ask you to resume your seat and hear the Taoiseach and then I will take your point of order.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	211	He is answering a question that you would not allow to be put. I tabled an amendment about this.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	212	This is about the late sitting.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	214	There is a question on a time motion and it is as easy for me to answer the two together, but I could just—
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	215	It is not as easy for us to ask.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Would Deputies like me to be helpful on the time motion, or do they just want to make noise generally?
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Questions and answers.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Taoiseach should come on and answer the question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	219	At least Deputy Timmins is honest. The Deputies do not really care about the tribunal and they do not really care about the time and they want answers to questions I answered before, so they can forget about it.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I ask the Deputies to resume their seats until the Taoiseach responds on the time motion.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I have noted what the Opposition has said and that the Deputies are not really interested in the time motion and they are less interested in the Flood tribunal. They want to ask questions about things that were answered already. If it helps, if there are people that want to speak, the Government has no problem sitting until 12 o'clock.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	222	We have asked a question of the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I am not allowed to answer that.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	224	We will now move on to proposal No. 2. Is the proposal for dealing with the Flood tribunal agreed to? I call Deputy Kenny.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I thank the Taoiseach for his agreement to allocate extra time. We are discussing the Flood tribunal without a question and answer session where questions will be answered by both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste about the central issue of this tribunal report which is not just about Mr. Ray Burke but about the Taoiseach's  judgment, leadership and action in appointing him in the first instance. That was the acid test of his leadership. The public wish to know why that appointment was made in the light of information given to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste which were contradictory.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Deputy should comment briefly on the arrangements that are being made.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The issues that flow from that central point have denigrated politics, lessened our integrity and weakened the credibility of democratic politics in this country. We will not agree to business until there is consent to a question and answer session with the two principal personalities involved, namely, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Hear, hear.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am trying to remain in order in presenting these cases which is why I have tabled two separate amendments. It is unconscionable that we would go through this debate and not have an opportunity to pose questions to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, all of whom have questions to answer, questions that will be posed legitimately during the course of the debate. I hope the Taoiseach will accept this amendment as he accepted the last amendment.I move amendment No. 2:On the proposal for dealing with No. 17, after "the following arrangements shall apply" to insert "the final 90 minutes prior to 1.30 p.m. shall be set aside for questions to be taken by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform".Any suggestion that Ministers or the Taoiseach will not make themselves available to answer straightforward questions in this House would constitute an act of political cowardice.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	230	It is important to point out that the inadequacy of the debate is compounded by the fact that beyond what is written here, there is no further provision for time for any member of my party. For that reason, there is a greater case that the order be amended and that the question and answer session gives facility to speak to any Member, as happened when Ray Burke was a Deputy and Minister and had to answer questions. This is no more than the accountability which the Taoiseach talks about so often being shown to actually work, the facility to ask questions and have them answered. That is what we are asking for, no more and no less and I ask that it be facilitated.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	231	While I understand and appreciate the importance of the focus of other colleagues in addressing the Taoiseach at this point on the Order of Business in regard to the interim report of the Flood tribunal, I still wish to have a response from him in regard to what is in my opinion the most pressing matter of the day, that is, the ongoing crisis in the peace process and my request of the Taoiseach to provide an opportunity for this issue to be addressed comprehensively in this House and at this time. I have offered a vehicle in terms of motion No. 48 or any other such that the Taoiseach would choose. To ignore this issue is a very worrying position for him to adopt.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Before hearing any other Deputies I am going to hear the Taoiseach. Standing Order No. 26 (2) is quite specific. It states:The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the order in which it shall be taken each day; and may propose, on motion made without notice at the commencement of public business, arrangements for sittings and for the taking of such business until such business has been disposed of; save [this is the important part in the current context] where any such proposal is opposed, the Ceann Comhairle shall permit a brief statement from a representative from each party in opposition and the Taoiseach before he or she puts the question thereon.Having heard a representative of each of the parties I now call on the Taoiseach.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	233	On a point of order, before proceeding in that fashion and in the interest of good relations between the parties in Government and the Opposition parties, I appeal to the Ceann Comhairle to allow the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond to the valid questions raised by the Opposition in anticipation of a positive reply.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Deputy, that is not a point of order.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It is not reasonable that the Taoiseach should reply under Standing Orders. Members should have a right—

If the Deputy is not happy with the Standing Order, he knows how to change it. The Standing Order is quite specific.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	248	No wonder the tribunals—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I will be brief but I will also try to be helpful. I apologise if I was taking two questions together when I should not have.When presented to the Dáil, the reports of all previous tribunals were dealt with in a similar way. This is a long established practice and precedent in the House. As no individual Minister is responsible for the establishment of tribunals – the Houses of the Oireachtas are – no question and answer session has ever taken place.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The Taoiseach without interruption.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I have listened carefully to what a number of Deputies said. This was the case in regard to the Kerry babies, Stardust, beef, building and McCracken tribunals, all of which were very serious. The legal issue is extremely important. Many people named in this report are now the subject of criminal investigation. In view of the comment of Mr. Justice Haugh and other justices, it is essential nothing is said which might prejudice a fair trial.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The Taoiseach without interruption.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	259	While I know Deputies will disagree with me, they should listen to me for a moment. This issue is relevant in two respects. In a debate which is not structured, comments may be made which may affect pre-trial publicity. This happened here recently and it has happened in the past. This has been pointed out by at least two eminent members of the Judiciary. Any questions about corruption of a wider nature than that referred to in the report would also be prejudicial. That is quite clear. Mr. Justice Haugh specifically referred to publicity given to proceedings in Dáil Éireann regarding the Haughey trial.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I will answer that point. There is no criticism of me in this report and I have no questions to answer in regard to issues in the report. In regard to questions raised in recent days the reply is the same as it was in September 1997 and in May 1998. A few issues have been raised repeatedly in the past few days and I will do my utmost to address these tomorrow in my contribution. If other questions are raised in regard to me, I will also try to deal with these in my contribution. The debate today is on the interim report of the Flood tribunal. I have no questions to answer about the contents of that report. The other questions—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	272	In respect of what is before the House, which is the completion of one interim report, maybe more, of Mr. Justice Flood, I cannot answer those questions. I am not party to those proceedings. I am not involved in those proceedings. I was not there for those proceedings. It would be impossible for me or any other Member of the Government to answer questions regarding five years' work by a tribunal. That is the factual position.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The European Union (Scrutiny) Bill is not as Deputy Ó Snodaigh said. Some very good amendments have been made to the Bill and it is worthwhile legislation. My difficulty is not with the Bill, on which we had a good debate. It deals with scrutiny and closing the democratic deficit between here and the European Union. We want to close the democratic deficit between the Government and the people by getting answers to the questions we demand as parliamentarians to have answered on the floor of the House. Some 100,000 people bought the interim report last week and we, as an Opposition, cannot allow ourselves to be swept aside in this way. There are questions for the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	389	In all my years in this House I have never been as outraged as I was by what happened today. The Taoiseach has said it is not for him to answer questions on the Flood report, but I can suggest a few reasons he should. First, the Taoiseach has collective responsibility for decisions taken by various Cabinets and Governments in which he served; second, he has been a major influence in shaping Fianna Fáil over the past decade; third, he lives and works in north Dublin; and, fourth, he knew all the players very well. Regarding the questions the Taoiseach will answer tomorrow—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	390	A question, please, Deputy.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	392	According to the record of the House for 7 October 1997, the Taoiseach described Raphael Burke as proud, honourable, loyal, true, persevering, principled, caring and committed. Is that still the Taoiseach's view of former Deputy Burke?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	393	There will have to be some latitude in replying now as we are not discussing the tribunal report. I have been criticised again today for appointing Ray Burke to Cabinet in 1997. Given the information revealed by Justice Flood, the judgment of hindsight is very clear. However, one's judgment at any given time is formed on the basis of what one believes is true at the time and the evidence then available. Of course I would not have appointed Ray Burke to Cabinet if I knew what I know now, five years later.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	394	Did the Taoiseach want to know?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	395	My decision at the time was a bona fide one based on Mr. Burke's undisputed political abilities, his categorical assurance he had done nothing wrong and a number of inquiries.  In my speech to the House tomorrow I intend to outline the investigation carried out in respect of rumours and allegations concerning the payment of money in relation to planning matters – most of these issues are already on the Dáil record.In reply to Deputy Kenny, it is sufficient to say that I was misled by Ray Burke, as was this House. Since the interim report of the Flood tribunal was published I have made my position clear. I condemn the corrupt activities and I have expressed my sense of betrayal. The obvious reason why anyone is appointed to a position is because of their competence and ability to do the job.I refer Deputies to what I told the House on 3 June 1998 when I stated:The first question I am asked is why I appointed Mr. Burke Minister for Foreign Affairs last June. Mr. Burke was an experienced and capable Minister, who had participated in an earlier phase of the talks process and in the work of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. As Leader of the Opposition, I had worked very well with him on Northern Ireland and European matters, where his judgment was very good. He was eminently qualified for the job of Minister for Foreign Affairs. When we came into office, I remind Deputies that there was no renewed IRA ceasefire and the talks had been stalled and going nowhere for over 12 months. Even in the short time that he was Minister he made his mark and we had arrived at a situation by the end of September where both the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin were sitting around the same table with others within weeks of a new IRA ceasefire.In reply to Deputy Howlin, I made my decision to appoint Ray Burke on the basis of the information that was available to me then—
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The Taoiseach knew he was misleading the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	397	—and the repeated assurance to me. The fact that I called Ray Burke an honourable man underlines the fact that I genuinely believed the assurance he had given me when I questioned him.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	398	It shows very poor judgment at best.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	399	In other situations others have taken colleagues at their word. On 3 December 1996, in a debate on the resignation of Michael Lowry, Deputy Kenny stated:I very much regret the departure of Deputy Michael Lowry from Cabinet. I have known him for many years both as a member of Fine Gael and as a Government colleague and he is a man of the highest integrity and honour.The then Tánaiste, former Deputy Spring, stated: "I have no difficulty in accepting Deputy Lowry's  assertion of integrity and propriety."  Hindsight is not foresight. What I know now is a different situation to what I knew then.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Does the Taoiseach now admit that the questions he asked in respect of the appointment of Raphael Burke to the Cabinet were adequate? Does he admit that he knew that Mr. Burke had received a £30,000 payment? Will he tell the House what information was given to him by former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, before he made that appointment? Will he tell the House what information was given to him by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, when he carried out an investigation on this matter? What oral or written evidence was given to him by the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, before he made that appointment? The Tánaiste had received information from the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that these matters were contradictory. Did he not think it fit and appropriate that he should speak to people like Mr. Bailey, Mr. Brennan, Mr. McGowan or, indeed, Mr. Gogarty, the person making the most allegations. With the whiff and the rumour and the swirling doubts that surrounded Ray Burke, it should have been perfectly obvious to the Taoiseach that here was a man who was legitimately held in deep suspicion by the public. As such this was a person not fit to hold high office and the Taoiseach's judgment in appointing him was flawed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	401	If all those things were said at that time we would not have had a debate in this House on the night the Government was appointed. Not one Member of this House—

#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I request Members to allow the Taoiseach the same courtesy that was offered to Deputy Kenny. The Taoiseach is entitled to be heard in silence in this House. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat. This is Leaders' questions, Deputy Rabbitte. The Deputy is not the leader yet. I ask him to obey the Standing Orders of the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	406	May I remind Deputy Rabbitte of two famous occasions in this House when people stood up. Some famous speeches have been made in this House.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	410	It was not the convention for people to get up and speak. I wish to answer the questions asked by the Deputies. I made whatever investigations I could. They are all documented in the record and I will outline them again tomorrow. Deputy Smith's inquiry in 1993 did not result in any facts or evidence being given to me. In December 1994, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn gave me a report and, as a result, the Mahfouz file was examined by the Minister who took over in the Department of Justice, former Deputy Nora Owen. I was out of office for a period of two and a half years. When I came back into office the tribunals had been set up. All those files are now subject to investigation by the Moriarty tribunal.I received a memo from the then Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, prior to my leaving office. I was not in power so it was not for me to examine the files. I did not know anything about Brennan and McGowan. I did not talk to Mr. Gogarty. I made some efforts with Bovale and JMSE. It was not a question that Members of this House did not know that money was received. During the 1997 election campaign I was asked by eminent journalists about Ray Burke and I made it absolutely clear that I was aware he had received money. That was written in several national newspapers. It was not illegal for him to receive that money. He said he had done nothing wrong. I took him at his word—
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	411	It was an exceptionally large sum of money.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I took the man's word. I did not have the powers of a major five-year investigation. If I had all the information then that has taken five years to uncover, I would certainly not have appointed him.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Twenty five years of friendship.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	416	This is the first occasion since June that this House has had the opportunity to hold this Government accountable. Since that time various Ministers have announced €350 million in cuts. Will the Taoiseach accept that the election campaign that brought his Government into office was the most deceitful campaign ever run in the history of this State? Will he accept that the Government that was elected on the basis of that fraudulent campaign of deceit has no validity or legitimacy whatsoever?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Even at this late stage will the Taoiseach instruct his Ministers to have their freedom of information officers supply the necessary information sought under the Freedom of Information Act by members of Fine Gael before the Nice polling day? The public attitude is being influenced by Government inactivity and misinformation in this matter. I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Howlin.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The freedom of information process takes its own route. The information which the Deputy seeks is outlined in the Department of Finance's report of last week. I am confident that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would be glad to facilitate the Deputy and his colleagues. That information is not confidential and most, if not all, of it is in the public domain.In reply to Deputy Howlin I will summarise the position. Any document put forward by my party during the election campaign was quite clear and all our actions during the campaign were also quite clear. Neither the Minister for Finance nor the Government had information before May which showed that the budget targets would not be met. This is clearly borne out by the Department of Finance's monthly expenditure management reports for Government, the reports from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and tax receipts, including projections for the remainder of the year, and the briefing notes for the Minister on the monthly Exchequer balance. When the Minister got information in June assessing the end of May position, which showed that the public expenditure targets would not be met, he took steps to remedy it. It has changed every month since.Unfortunately, the position is deteriorating and that is why the Minister has stated that even the memo which came into the public domain is now out of date. Last week his officials outlined the up-to-date position. It is incorrect, untrue and hypocritical for anyone to say that these figures were not spelled out. I would like those who analyse these issues and financial journalists to look at the profile right through since last December. All those figures are available in the Department. People would then see exactly how the year progressed and that there is no truth in these statements.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Does the Taoiseach accept that the response he has given is incredible and an insult to the intelligence of the electorate? Does he accept the statement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on "Morning Ireland" on 13 May when he described as absolute nonsense the assertion that there might be secret plans for cutbacks? The Minister said there were no secret plans for cutbacks and that there would be no cutbacks. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in a written response to Deputy Noonan on 13 May, wrote above his signature that he could confirm that no secret overruns were projected and no cutbacks were  planned, secretly or otherwise. That, in the context of the leaked memo, which was being prepared at the same time to outline a series of cuts, shows the deception with which his party fooled the people and gained office fraudulently.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I totally reject that and I will give some reasons to the House as to why. On the last budget day and more recently in February in the Revised Estimates volume, the Minister stated that there would be a 14% increase in gross public expenditure for the year 2002. It is still of the order of 20%. In areas like social, community and family affairs, it is 25% and in health and education, it is in double digits. The additional expenditure in 2002 over 2001 is €3.6 billion.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	422	How an increase of €3.6 billion or, in the case of health, over €1 billion, is a cutback is beyond me and Deputy Howlin might, on another occasion, explain why he considers that to be the case. The Minister stated that the entire expenditure he indicated would be spent in 2002, as per the Revised Estimates volume, would be spent. In some areas like health, although the increase this year is enormous and in double digits, more is required where there are demand-led schemes. The Minister has provided an enormous amount of additional resources to health on top of what he stated in the Revised Estimates and on top of what he said on—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I do not want to go back to the public expenditure of the 1980s but I remember the position then and the national debt being double what it is now. I recall record unemployment and the country being in bits. I remember 1987 when we took over from the Deputy's party and Fine Gael. I remember all of those things but I would rather stick to 2002 because it might be more helpful to the people.For 2002, public expenditure is about €3.6 billion more than it was last year and is in excess of the projected 14% to which the Minister is still endeavouring to get back. There have been enormous increases in the priority areas of health, education and social, community and family affairs. In areas where the Minister has had to tighten up, it is to create additional money in  excess of the figures I stated for those demand-led areas.

I have received no correspondence from the Government Whip as to any proposals for Government time being allocated. I raise this matter because there will not be foreign affairs questions until 6 November and there is no foreign affairs committee meeting. At the moment we are participating in changes in the text which would illegally allow the bombing of Iraq and, in addition, we are allowing Shannon Airport to be used for preparations in advance of military activity. Will the Tánaiste indicate—

I noticed it is not in the Government's legislative programme either for this session or for next year. Does the Tánaiste believe that a statute is needed to implement the programme, and what is the status of the board?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The Deputy is correct and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in urgent consultations with the Attorney General to ascertain what changes, if any, to the law will be required. It is important to reassure people that other protection afforded under domestic violence legislation, such as safety and barring orders, is still available.

The Tánaiste need not consult her notes because there is no mention of the legislation in the Government's programme. When will the legislation appear? Can Deputy Brennan, the Minister, comment on it?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18105	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	471	Six years ago the same Minister promised this legislation and the Tánaiste also said that it would be a priority, yet this Government, now in its second term, has not done anything.On promised legislation, profiteering occurred in some sections of the service sector during the euro changeover, while the promised action to prevent profiteering did not occur. Has the Tánaiste any legislative proposals to deal with the shocking findings of the Forfás report which was presented to her this summer but about which we have had no debate? We have become the most expensive country for basic services and the Government just sits on its hands.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The most effective legislation in this area relates to competition. We recently enacted strong legislation giving the Competition Authority more power. The Forfás report said there was no evidence that the changeover caused the rise in prices and it gave other reasons, as the Deputy knows.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18105	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	473	That is not so. It did blame the changeover. The Tánaiste is inadvertently misleading the House.

#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The Deputy is now being disorderly and we must move on.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I move:That Dáil Éireann:– notes the findings of the Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments;– condemns the actions of those against whom the tribunal has made findings;– commends the work of Mr. Justice Flood and his legal team; and– expresses its continuing support for the ongoing work of the tribunal.The interim report of the Flood Tribunal is a highly significant contribution to Irish public and political life. Its findings on the modules completed to date are unambiguous and show the thoroughness with which it has carried out its investigations. Mr. Justice Flood has sent out a very clear message to anyone who has any corrupt dealings, or is contemplating such dealings in relation to the planning system, that they will not get away with it. As the Government Minister with responsibility for the operation of the planning system, I fully support this message.The Garda Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are examining the interim report. Mr. Justice Flood has already sent the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Corruption and the act of hindering or obstructing a tribunal are criminal offences and the law in this regard must be enforced. The findings of the tribunal are a blow to the political system. It is unacceptable for any person who holds high office and the trust of both the Government and the public, to accept corrupt payments in return for political favours.A good land use planning system is an essential part of ensuring a high quality of life for all of us. Its purpose is to ensure that development is orderly and sustainable and that it leads to a better physical environment where people can live and work. Land use planning is necessarily complex as it involves mediating development in the public interest. Property values are affected by planning decisions and it is essential that the principles of probity, fairness and transparency are  seen to operate. As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I am determined that the planning system should be transparent, sustainable and efficient and support a modern competitive economy. The development plan process allows us to develop a positive vision of the future of an area and monitor the achievement of that vision. It must allow us to ensure that development land is delivered on time and in the right place and with necessary services. The plan must also promote the conservation and protection of the environment. The community must also, of course, be generally satisfied that the vision set out in the development plan is right.Mr. Justice Flood has made his interim findings and they are disturbing. He has not made any specific recommendations at this stage in relation to amendments to planning, local government or ethics in public office legislation. However, although much important work remains to be completed by the tribunal, some ongoing improvements of planning law and procedure can still be beneficially advanced by the Government in the meantime. The Government has already made a series of significant changes to planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to make the planning system more transparent. The Act introduced more opportunities for public consultation into the process for making development plans, particularly before a formal draft plan is made. Strict timetables have been introduced so that development plans must be adopted every six years and a two year timetable is set out for doing so. Therefore the practice where development plans were let get out of date and where the adoption period was dragged out has been eliminated. Procedures for the making of declarations of interest by elected members and officials have been updated. The Act also provides for mandatory codes of conduct for members and officials of planning authorities. These provisions have now been superseded by the Local Government Act, 2001, which sets out comprehensive ethics provisions for local government staff and members in the operation of all their functions, not just planning ones.National codes of conduct are currently being drawn up by my Department to give effect to these provisions and are being finalised as a matter of urgency. In the context of an ethical framework it is not merely enough to avoid actual impropriety. The actions of all participants must also be seen to be above suspicion. In order to avoid any risk of damage to public confidence in local government any appearance of improper conduct must be avoided.Up to now, local authorities generally have not had a national spatial framework within which to position their development plans. For the past three years the authorities in the greater Dublin area have had the benefit of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. A national spatial strategy for the entire country is being finalised and will be published shortly. Local authorities will be required to ensure that  development plans are in line with the NSS. The strategy will set out a blueprint for the development of the country as a whole and for the achievement of more balanced regional development and will provide a clear context for local authority development plans.Over the past five years my Department has been pro-actively engaging with planning policy advice. We have issued planning guidelines on matters such as increasing residential densities, wind farms mobile phone masts and child care. Draft guidelines on landscape protection have also issued. The purpose of these guidelines is to assist local authorities in carrying out their planning functions and to give all involved in the planning system up to date guidance on best practice. My Department is working on draft guidelines on the adoption of development plans and has also commenced consultation on revised and updated guidelines for development control.In light of the findings of the Flood Tribunal the suggestion has been voiced that land use zoning functions should be made or at least overseen by a national zoning committee, possibly chaired by a High Court judge and staffed by planners. The central tenet in these suggestions is that zoning is not appropriate to local authorities or councillors.Mr. Justice Flood has not made any findings in his interim report that the rezoning of land was procured corruptly. He found that Mr. Burke assured those present at the time of the payment of moneys to him that he understood that the payment was being made to him in connection with the proposal to alter the planning status of the Murphy lands and further assured those present that he would honour his commitment to do so. Mr. Justice Flood found that the payment received by Mr. Burke amounted to a corrupt payment and all present were aware that it was such. However, the lands in question were not rezoned. The provisions of the Planning Acts would have contributed to this outcome, whereby rezoning is carried out in public, following public consultation and by majority decision of the elected members. Therefore, no one person can ensure the outcome of a proposal to zone land. That is as it should be. The vast majority of local councillors are honest people who carry out their functions faithfully and with no personal gain.Zoning functions are only one among a range of significant planning policy decisions for which local councils are responsible. It is also the case that many rural local authorities carry out little or no zoning. Elected councils are also concerned with adopting housing strategies, local area plans and strategic development zones for housing and economic development, approving proposed developments which would be in material contravention of the development plan, adopting a register of protected structures, and specifying other important non-zoning objectives of their development plans.Subsidiarity in the taking of decisions at the lowest appropriate level is a principle which has been endorsed at international and national level. It is a basic consideration, for example, in the definition of our relationship with the European Union and in charters for good governance issued by the Council of Europe and other bodies. It also guides Irish policies on good governance. We can all recall that, in 1999, the Irish people voted at a referendum to enshrine a role for local government in our Constitution.The reform of local Government undertaken by the last Government was aimed at ensuring a modern dynamic system. The strategic policy committees were introduced to broaden participation and these committees now provide a valuable input to development plan policies. The county and city development boards have also contributed greatly.Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Partnership, recently published principles for sustainable development. Principle 11 provides that decision making should be devolved to the appropriate level and principle 12 states that stake holder participation should be promoted at all levels of decision making.It is also the case that land use and zoning decisions are generally local government functions in other jurisdictions. For all of the reasons I have outlined, I am inclined to the view that land use planning is generally appropriate to decision making at local level. The key challenge, therefore, is to ensure openness, probity, fairness and efficiency in the operation of the planning system.It seems to be better, therefore, at this stage to press ahead with the recent reforms of the 2000 Act, but also to await the recommendations of Mr. Justice Flood in due course. The first development plans to be adopted under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, are due for completion by the end of 2003. We will assess the process in light of that experience. The revised development control procedures only came into force on 11 March this year, so it is a little early yet to judge their impact on increasing efficiency.Aside from the planning code itself, the Taoiseach outlined in his public statement of 26 September 2002, the intensive campaign of legislative reform which has been launched to ensure the highest standards in public office. The Prevention of Corruption Act , 2002, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Act, 2001, have all recently been passed into law.In particular, as part of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the Standards in Public Office Commission is empowered to carry out inquiries and investigations into the conduct of politicians and those in public life. The Commission is chaired by a judge of the High Court and has powers to order the production of documentation and information. The Standards in Public Office Commission is a permanent statutory body set up to monitor, investigate and regulate the conduct  of those elected to serve the Irish people or who are employed in the public service. This is to ensure the maintenance of proper ethical standards. This Act imposes on politicians and others an obligation to have one's tax affairs in order, and to swear a statutory declaration that this is so. An independent and powerful body such as the Standards in Public Office Commission with an ongoing mandate to supervise and maintain proper ethical standards is the best guarantee that what has happened in the past will not be permitted in the future.The Government also intends to quickly enact legislation to recover assets obtained by or enhanced through corruption. Proceeds obtained through this legislation will be paid to the Exchequer and held for the benefit of those who have suffered, namely, the Irish people.A Corruption Assets Bureau will be established which will recover assets corruptly obtained and also any increase in the value of an asset that has been obtained through corruption. The proposed new legislation will specifically empower a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent – acting as an officer of the Corruption Assets Bureau to form an opinion based in whole or in part on the report of a tribunal of inquiry, whether the tribunal reported before or after the passing of the legislation.Under the new legislation, when a tribunal reports, if, in the opinion of the tribunal, persons received or gave corrupt payments, or received benefits as a result of corrupt practices in which they participated, a chief superintendent acting as an officer of the Corruption Assets Bureau can go to the High Court and obtain freezing orders in respect of assets corruptly obtained or whose value has been corruptly enhanced.Second, the proposed new legislation will empower the High Court to appoint inspectors to the affairs of an individual or a company whose task will be to trace assets – assets corruptly received or assets whose value were corruptly enhanced through acquisitions and disposals and to report to the High Court on the current value of assets obtained with assets-funds which represent the direct or indirect proceeds of corruption.Third, the High Court will be given specific statutory power to adjust the value of assets corruptly received into current day values. For example, if a person corruptly received £1,000 in 1960 and bought a house with that money the High Court will be entitled to order that the current day value of the house be frozen or forfeited.Fourth, the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1976, applies to property which directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime. The proposed legislation will extend that definition to include reference to property whose value was corruptly enhanced. It is therefore clear that the Government will not tolerate corruption in public life.When Mr Justice Flood took on the task of investigating allegations of corruption in the plan ning process in 1997, neither he nor the Government expected that the work of the tribunal would be still under way five years later. However, we all knew he had a difficult task ahead of him. My predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, when Minister for the Environment in 1993, directed that the Garda Síochána be asked to investigate allegations of corruption in the planning system which were reported in the media. The investigations did not disclose evidence which, in the view of the Garda, would warrant charges against any individual. Mr. Justice Flood has shown that a tribunal, led by a tenacious and committed chairman, is an effective means of investigating matters such as these.Mr Justice Flood has indicated that he expects that a final report on the matters, which are the subject of current private hearings being conducted by the tribunal, will not be delivered for at least another two years. The tribunal has cost almost €22 million to date. However, the Government is wholly committed to providing the tribunal with the resources it requires to continue with work set out in its terms of reference so that these matters can be resolved once and for all.The tribunal is also being enlarged by the addition of two further members who will be appointed shortly and will assist Mr. Justice Flood in giving full consideration to all evidence brought before the tribunal. It is essential that all those persons asked to co-operate and assist the tribunal in its work do so in a full and truthful manner. There is no excuse for the failure of persons to provide information to the tribunal or for hindering or obstructing the work of the tribunal.The Government welcomes the interim report of the Flood tribunal and the clear message it sends out to all persons who engage in corrupt practices. The tribunal has shown that wrongdoing will be exposed. The legislation enacted and proposed by the Government will ensure that we have anti-corruption legislation appropriate to a modern democracy. This legislation will be enforced. It behoves all Members of the House to uphold the principles of public service.

His plain speaking blew out equivocation. It rid us forever of the notion that some of us are above the law. His report sets the standard for all other tribunals.Mr. Justice Flood has left us in no doubt that when it comes to securing probity in Irish political life, there can be no more weasel words, no more poor recollection, no more squirming, avoiding, posturing, shirking or smirking. He made it crystal clear that in the conduct of the public business, there should be only truth, truth told willingly, wholly and on time. Today, on behalf of my party and of the thoroughly disillusioned people of the country, I thank him. He has done the State some service.The State, with all its connotations in Irish political life, is just one of the critical contexts in which we must consider this report today. It must also be considered in other key contexts – our national institutions, the criteria necessary for high public office, appointment to Cabinet, political and national leadership, even democracy itself.I am proud to be the leader of the party that founded this State. The Governments that succeeded us followed our example, setting great store by the integrity of the Executive and the blind impartiality of the institutions. Consequently, Ireland built up a fine international reputation as a country where the Government and its institutions were above reproach. That reputation was the basis of our so-called tiger economy. The word went out that Ireland was a country worth investing in. When other countries were rocked by scandal and corruption, Ireland was clean, that is, until successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments  unleashed sleaze and scandal on a scale never seen before, and that will I hope not be seen again, on the politics and institutions of our country. In the past ten years, sleaze and scandal have been attached umbilically to the senior coalition partner – blank cheques, Mazri, Haughey, Lawlor, Sheedy, Foley, Flynn, Ellis and Burke.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The interim report of the Flood tribunal adds two further monstrous epitaphs to Fianna Fáil's already soiled reputation – bribery and corruption. The Taoiseach presided over much of this sleaze and therefore he has serious questions to answer. He was the chairman, the chief, and it was on his watch and in his time that it happened. His flat refusal to accept responsibility in the matter and his outright rejection in terms of making himself accountable to this House or to the people sees Fianna Fáil become more rank and more odious by the day because the stench of corruption travels far.Is it any wonder then that our reputation is tarnished, that the perception is gaining ground that Ireland is a place where favours can be bought, where the public, especially our young people, in all their passion and idealism, are deeply suspicious of or even utterly indifferent to politics and politicians?Ireland is facing an uncertain future. Inflation is now the highest in Europe. Cuts to public services, secret or otherwise, went from none to €300 million to €500 million and now €1 billion. Who knows what the figures will be next week, next month or next year. Jobs are fewer and far less secure. That uncertain future demands a leader equal to its challenges. The findings of the Flood report provide incontrovertible evidence that the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, by his judgment and his action is no longer that leader.If there has been one constant theme in his entire political career it is this, and it gives me no great pleasure to say it – an unbroken thread of denial, shiftiness and contradiction. The findings of the Flood report and its attendant revelations have shown the Taoiseach to be dogged by denials, explanations and clarifications. Indeed they reveal his past failure to lead as pathological. Flood severely questions the Taoiseach's judgment, not only as being the man for the job in the first instance but especially for the tough days ahead. If he was the man for the job, how could he have appointed Ray Burke to the third highest political office in the land? Was this not the acid test of his judgment and leadership?The media and senior politicians advised him quite clearly against this but he ignored that advice and doggedly pursued the elevation of a man known to be on the take, over whom ques tions hung and in respect of whom unease, rumour and other persistent allegations lingered. You might say it was an intriguingly unpolitic decision for one so cute – sheer GUBU. One has to ask, did Ray Burke have something on him? His investigation of the Burke allegations was a total sham. He told the Dáil on 28 May 1998: "I tried to find out the truth but got nowhere."  Then he made an immediate contradiction: "I did not go around as an investigator, I simply tried to follow up inquiries that had been made but people would not give me any information."

Did he not ask Dunlop, Bailey or Brennan, Fianna Fáil stalwarts all? Could he not have gone straight to James Gogarty, who was the named chief witness against Burke? No, but he went up every tree in north Dublin. Would any of these people not have confirmed the truth to him or was it a case of being afraid to unearth the true extent of what exactly was going on? Make no mistake about it, the Taoiseach has questions to answer and he should answer them now because the people, like this Dáil, are waiting. A total of 100,000 people either bought the report or downloaded it from the website. They must have been very surprised this morning to hear the Government Chief Whip let the cat out of the bag when she said that the only questions the Taoiseach will answer are questions that he answered previously in the same way. Perhaps they will be one of the following quotations.On 27 September 1997 the Taoiseach stated: "I asked Ray Burke, back in the summer before I set up the Cabinet, about this story of the £30,000 and he assured me at that particular time that he had received this money but that he had done nothing for the company and that he was involved in nothing wrong".On 28 May 1998 the Taoiseach stated: "I do not recall if I particularly asked about any individual company". Later on he stated:I cannot recall if I asked him if he received money from Murphys or JMSE . . . In terms of any discussion I would have had with him, he did not tell me about that contribution.The answers go on and on but whatever nugget the Taoiseach chooses, one thing is sure. The public awaits him convinced that the truth will out eventually.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	489	The moral tone of the Government of which the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is a member is dubious. It bought the election. It lied about the public finances and greased politics with business – remember the organ-grinder and the monkey – to get the vote out in marginal  Macroom. It broke the country in one Dáil term, all in the middle of a boom. The Taoiseach appointed a corrupt man to high political office and, when challenged, he defended him royally. He stated: "A good man hounded out of office by rumour and unsubstantiated allegation". At first, Ray was the best of them but then, true to form with the Taoiseach, he was the worst. As he put it in his memorable statement to RTE's "Prime Time", he was "deserving of all the public criticism made of him". Elsewhere he stated: "Ray betrayed us, he let us down". Today, those same words apply to the Taoiseach himself because by refusing to answer questions that go to the very heart of power and public life, he lets down himself and his country and denigrates democratic politics. When it comes to Ray Burke, his man for the job, the Taoiseach should explain what he knew and when he knew it.The problem, however, is no longer Ray Burke, who will be dealt with eventually by the law. The problem is with the Taoiseach, in his capacity as leader of the country. Let me ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to answer the following questions, as he has promised to do fully when he replies to this debate tomorrow.What evidence, oral or written, did he receive from the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, before he appointed Ray Burke? What evidence, oral or written, did he receive from the former Minister for Justice, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, before he appointed Ray Burke? What evidence, oral or written, did he receive from the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, before he appointed Ray Burke? What evidence did he provide to the Tánaiste? Was it not clear to both of them that a man was being appointed to Cabinet about whom deep and legitimate suspicions were held, a man whom both knew had taken a £30,000 corrupt payment? Was there no other person of clean character who could have been appointed? What reason can the Taoiseach give for introducing retrospective legislation that benefited one citizen only and a known Fianna Fáil supporter to boot? Why did he travel to Macroom, County Cork, before the election to announce the purchase of a plant and job creation with the chief executive of the Élan company when that company's board had not approved the purchase and the IDA had not authorised it? Did the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment know about this or was it because of Mr. P. J. Mara's consultancy? Can the Taoiseach explain his strange interregnum decision to tax designate the Golden Island site in Athlone against departmental and official advice, after the Labour Party had walked out of that Government? Was his role in the State's purchase of the Battle of the Boyne site, which netted huge profits for a close friend of the Taoiseach, entirely subject to scrutiny?Why, after Mr. Justice Flood's verdict that Ray Burke had acted against the public interest, will the Taoiseach not now instigate a thorough investigation of all Government decisions to which he  was party, especially in the controversial area of communications, oil and gas licences and any other decisions promoted by the said corrupt Minister? What of the passport files, currently with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by all accounts now considerably expanded? Why was Ray Burke so anxious that no public inquiry would be held into their allocation? Now that he has read the file the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must respond fully.The Taoiseach's denials were without substance in the case of Ray Burke, despite persistent rumours. Similar persistent rumours now abound that he himself may be one of four currently serving Ministers who received a dubious payment of £80,000. While rumour is no substitute for fact, if the Taoiseach's conscience is clear, why does he not deal with this matter as he did so effectively in the case of the allegations by Mr. Starry O'Brien?It must be difficult for the newly-elected Fianna Fáil TDs who find themselves in this political quagmire. Perhaps some will do the decent thing and put pressure on their leader to come clean. He refused to do so in regard to Burke. He is doing it again in regard to Flood. If there are good people on the Fianna Fáil benches, and I strongly suspect there are, they will have the opportunity to show themselves tomorrow. They should stand by the truth, and by the Republic.What about the absent Progressive Democrats, those watchdogs for the public? How can they stand idly by on their moral mountain in regard to this matter?The Taoiseach says he is a democrat but he is now behaving like a despot. Just as his trusted lieutenants, Ray Burke and Liam Lawlor, were not above the law, so he is not above question. His inquisitors are losing patience. His people are losing faith. His country, and ours, is losing credibility internationally.The Nice referendum has brought us firmly within the sights of those fledgling democracies of eastern Europe. It is a damning indictment of the Taoiseach and the Government that there can be even the merest whiff that their behaviour, collectively and individually, would not be entirely out of place in those old regimes – politics greasing the wheels of business, business lining the pockets of politicians, leaders who believe that they have no need to be publicly accountable. It is a bleak page in this nation's history. If the Nice referendum is passed, which I expect will be the case, it will be in spite of this Government and not because of it.The Taoiseach, in his handling of this affair, has brought the highest political office in the land into the lowest possible public repute. Personally, he may care less, as he indicated the other night, but politically he should be conscious of the great onus that is upon him and show even some limited understanding of his responsibilities as Taoiseach. The people made him their leader. They  gave him his power. They entrusted to him a commodity so precious that people in every part of the world, in every generation, have endured war, torture, exile, prison and even death to attain it. They gave him their vote. That vote gave him power and now, in the name of democracy, he must pay for it.Truth is the price and that same truth will be the watchword for the Fine Gael Party. The Government should get used to it. Our actions now will determine how much we can limit the damage this issue has caused for the future.My party has put forward two specific proposals, which will be dealt with by Deputy Allen and others, aimed at preventing any future corruption of the planning process. We favour the establishment of a national land use commission to certify all future rezoning decisions by local authorities and the establishment of a permanent anti-corruption office to investigate allegations against public representatives or public officials.I want to put it on record that if in its future work the Flood tribunal finds that a serving or former Fine Gael public representative acted improperly, there can be no room for him or her in this party. The people we serve and represent are entitled to propriety and probity. Probity is exactly what this debate is about. Further, it is about the kind of leadership we have, the kind we want and the kind we will need in the future. Is it the kind that appoints Mr. Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs? Is it the kind that appoints Liam Lawlor to the Committee on Members' Interests? Is it the kind that appointed Denis Foley to the DIRT inquiry and left him there long after he had been exposed as the holder of an Ansbacher account? Or is it the kind that appoints a director of elections for the Nice campaign whom Mr. Justice Flood found to have failed to co-operate with the tribunal, yet whom the Taoiseach finds to be completely innocent?What kind of leadership do we get from a Taoiseach who says that the tribunal has nothing at all to do with him, that in fact he is hardly mentioned? Is that the kind of leader we want for our country, our children and our future? I think not. The Taoiseach's central presence in all these sordid events has done this State no service. The persistent allegations and swirling doubts do us no good as a nation. Our reputation is tarnished and our credibility is weakened; our integrity is undermined and our people are embarrassed. In most other democracies the Taoiseach would have resigned. Regrettably, the Taoiseach is in many ways past his peak as leader. For him, the ebb tide has now begun to flow. This is so serious – the first case ever of a tribunal's confirming the existence of a corrupt Minister appointed, with knowledge, by this Taoiseach – that if he fails to answer all the critical questions fully and completely he should consider his position and step down as Taoiseach. Otherwise, inevitably, that right will be removed from him.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I am glad to be given the opportunity of speaking on one of the most momentous reports ever debated in this House. I regret the circumstances that prevent the Taoiseach from being present, but I would have expected the Tánaiste and senior members of the Government to be present for the opening comments on this matter which has galvanised the country in recent weeks. No Taoiseach in history has fallen from grace as quickly or as completely as Mr. Bertie Ahern. The man who could walk on water a few short months ago is now perceived as a political liability even by his own. The face that looked down upon us from every hoarding, lamp-post and pole during the May general election campaign is absent from the poles and hoardings during the Nice referendum campaign of this October. The allegations of Fianna Fáil Deputies gathered in huddled groups, weary of the damage he has done to their party, is evidence enough. Finally, the Taoiseach has been found out.The people expected great things from this Taoiseach – the professional ordinary man, the man of the people. They gave him their trust. That trust was broken in the aftermath of the general election. It was shattered beyond repair by the findings of Mr. Justice Flood in his second interim report. I do not know why the Taoiseach appointed Mr. Raphael Burke to the Cabinet in June 1997. Only Ray Burke and the Taoiseach know that. I do not know why he brought Liam Lawlor back from the political wilderness. I do not believe we shall know the answers to those questions at the end of this debate either, despite the protestations of the Taoiseach on the Order of Business today.The bottom line is quite simple. There were umpteen warnings to the Taoiseach about Ray Burke prior to and after June 1997. Each of them was individually significant, including those of Jimmy Guerin, Fianna Fáil member and activist, whose voice and opinion would be known and trusted by the Taoiseach; Mr. Gogarty; the Tánaiste, Ms Harney, reporting to the Taoiseach the views of a whistle-blower from inside JMSE; and a former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds. There are probably more we do not know about. Each of those voices is significant by itself, but together they were surely compelling and damning. At the absolute minimum they warranted serious investigation. The Taoiseach could not even bring himself to ask Mr. Burke a direct question. More telling still, the Taoiseach chose Deputy Dermot Ahern to make inquiries on his behalf. It beggars belief that he could not confront Mr. Burke and simply ask him a direct question. No doubt the Taoiseach now regrets his infamous remark about having been up every tree in north Dublin.However, even the minuscule inquiries he did succeed in making should have been enough. On 24 June 1997, Deputy Dermot Ahern reported to the Taoiseach that JMSE was denying making any payment to Mr. Burke. Why would a company, being asked in confidence by a senior mem ber of the party it strongly supported, deny making a political donation to another senior member of the party if that donation was above board, genuine, legitimate and satisfactory? Yet by 27 June the Taoiseach was able to tell the Tánaiste that the payment JMSE claimed had not been made had been made. How was he in a position to do so? We do not know, because in the Dáil on 28 May – fast becoming an infamous date for the Taoiseach – he sought to suggest, among other things, that he was not aware of the donation until Ray Burke's Dáil statement about the affair.What we do know is that he certainly did not ask Mr. Burke himself, or if he did, he denied doing so to this House when asked that specific question by Deputy Quinn – again, not surprisingly, on 28 May 1998. The Taoiseach has since sought to suggest that he did not mean what he said on 28 May, but his colleague, Deputy Ahern, thought he knew the line he was supposed to follow. In defence of the position that he thought the Taoiseach was adopting about his ignorance of the JMSE payment, and as related by the Taoiseach to the House, Deputy Ahern told the Dáil a week later that the Taoiseach was in no position to know about the Burke payment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18105	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I move:That Dáil Éireann condemns the Taoiseach and his Ministers for gross misrepresentation of the budgetary position in the run-up to the general election, and for abandoning all prudence in the management of public finances which has resulted in the general Government balance being €5 billion off the target set by the Government itself.I wish to share my time with Deputies O. Mitchell, Ring, Connaughton and McCormack. Tonight we are in a very grave situation in that in a short number of months after the general election what I believe is the united voice of the Opposition parties is setting a case of the People versus Deputy B. Ahern and Companies. I lay eight serious charges before the Dáil tonight of gross mismanagement of the public finances. The charges are that on 13 May 2002 the Minister for Finance, with the collusion of the Taoiseach and other Ministers, deliberately and knowingly misled the public about the true state of the public finances; the Minister for Finance recklessly  undermined the tax base by indulging in ill-considered tax giveaways that were only partially costed; the Taoiseach and his Ministers in 2001 and again in 2002 engaged in public spending far beyond the limit sanctioned by the Dáil; the Taoiseach and his Ministers abandoned the minimum standards of prudent management of public finances by repeatedly entering into binding commitments without assessing the true costs or benefits of those commitments; the Taoiseach and his Ministers have failed to deliver improvements in public services to warrant the massive spending they have undertaken; the Minister for Finance profligately tapped once-off sources of revenue to paper over the deficit spending in a way which is not in accord with the sound principles of financial management; in implementing cutbacks the Taoiseach and his Ministers have crudely targeted spending that benefits weak and voiceless sections of the community and have increased charges to the public at a time when runaway inflation is already undermining living standards and competitiveness; and the Taoiseach and his Ministers conspired to squander a surplus created by Irish workers of €4.8 billion and in its place will run up a deficit this year of at best €750 million by the end of the year.If a person buys a second-hand car and finds on returning home that the clock had been tampered with and turned back, what really rankles with him or her is that he or she has been conned. One has no comeback when one's proud choice begins to guzzle gas, burn oil and break its timing belt because the people who have made these commitments are safely on their way and gone out of reach. That is what happened with the Irish public when the Government and Minister sold them a pup as to the true nature and state of the public finances in the run-up to the general election. Gradually, over the summer months, the public began to see the reality under the bonnet of that "much done, more to do" model they had just bought. A sad state of affairs was revealed. The sick were asked to pay 21% more in drugs refund, 26% more at casualty, 10% more in their hospital beds, parents had to pay 70% more to register their children at college, staff in hospitals were laid off, promised recruitment was cancelled, local authority rents were increased by 18%, the VHI increased by 18% and the ESB increased by 13% in order to fuel Government coffers. Support for disadvantaged pupils and adults trying to return to education was cut. This is what the "much done, more to do" model produced over the summer months. Yet the Taoiseach and his Ministers repeat the mantra "no cutbacks". Even Fianna Fáil backbench TDs – sadly none of them are here this evening – began to blush as they were kept in the dark, knee deep in manure, while these cutbacks were loaded on people's backs.Three days before the election the Minister gave a solemn assurance that the budget was fully on target, no cutbacks were planned secretly or  otherwise and taxes would come in on target. However, within three weeks of the election he produced a detailed memorandum calling for a detailed menu of cutbacks and new charges to be implemented. He asks us to believe none of this was in preparation prior to the election when he made his solemn commitment. I do not accept that because the figures speak for themselves. The Taoiseach said earlier that the figures were showing a very healthy state of affairs up to 13 May when the Minister made these pronouncements. This could not be further from the truth. Tax revenue in January was minus 6%, plus 9% in February, minus 7% in March and static in April and May. There was clear evidence tax was going off the rails at that stage. Spending was even worse. In January and February, it was up 22%, in March it was up 36% and in May it was up 50%. The Minister let go of the reins on the public finances. Ministers were spending and recruiting left, right and centre in the run-up to the election. The Minister made commitments in the budget, including on tax, which he had not properly costed and the people were taken in.The Taoiseach will not call them cutbacks because if he did, he would be admitting he lied to the people. Senior Ministers and the Taoiseach knew exactly the medicine that was in preparation for the public at the time these commitments were made. It was deception on a massive scale. From the very beginning the budget figures were treated with contempt. They were no more than a spin to give a veneer of respectability to the reckless political project that was under way. We are told that the Department of Finance was issuing warnings but the Taoiseach and his Minister partied on. Recruitment to the public service accelerated and spending was brought forward for maximum electoral impact. I recall that child benefit was brought forward. There was so much money they could not get it out the door fast enough. This was the great new partying the Minister pronounced. The monthly evidence that spending was out of control and that revenue was collapsing was simply ignored. This was an inconvenient truth that would wait until after the election.The Minister for Finance recently let the mask slip in Killarney when he said, "What was I to do? I was there to win Fianna Fáil the election."  That is the sort of cynical thinking that underpinned the pronouncements made during the course of the general election. The people now realise it and this is why their anger is so deep. The public is now to suffer the hangover for the Government's binge. In the scramble for cutbacks the Government has left untouched the big bureaucracies, army of advisers and spindoctors. Instead the axe is falling on the crumbs that come across the table to ordinary punters, those dependent on the State for health and education services and on local authority housing lists for housing. The cuts have fallen on the weak and voiceless because the Government knows it will get away with it. They are the soft touch. When  Ministers were asked to tighten up, they did not turn first to the bureaucracies that are producing so little. The Minister repeatedly expresses his anguish at how little these bureaucracies are producing, yet he presided over a situation whereby instead of trying to reform public spending to get better value the Government, in its stumbling for cutbacks, imposed extra charges on ordinary people.It is difficult to believe the Government has squandered the hard-earned surplus of €4.8 billion built up by the workers of this country in just two years. It took just two years for the Government to let that surplus go out the window. The sad tale is there for anyone to read. I know the Minister does not like to be reminded of the harsh facts. In 2001, the Dáil approved extra spending of €2.9 billion at budget time. The Taoiseach allowed his Minister to spend €3.6 billion and he overran by 24%. In 2002, on current performance the Minister, having received sanction for the budget for €2.8 billion, is now heading for an increase in spending of €4 billion. This is a 45% overrun in the spending commitments sanctioned by the Dáil at budget time. If that is not massive loss of control of public spending, I do not know what is.The story is the same on the tax side of the budget. In budget 2001, the Minister said he would raise an extra €3.2 billion but he raised just €649,000. He was 80% short of the target he set himself. In 2002, his target was €2.4 billion in extra tax revenue. He is saying optimistically he will raise €1 billion extra but one does not believe him. On his own estimate he will be 54% short of target. Was that not a case of public finances being shot through by reckless Ministers? They made tax commitments that they clearly could not live up to. They have cost the taxpayer a fortune. They just ignored the spending restrictions the Dáil agreed to when they were imposed and they ploughed on. We have had so many examples of this. Deputy Olivia Mitchell could tell one of the example of medical cards for those aged over 70. The Government had no clue what it would cost when it made that commitment.When Stadium Ireland was introduced it was heralded as a marvellous idea. Where are we now? We have spent €400 million and we have nothing. The Taoiseach is now traipsing the country with an offer of land probably worth another €500 million looking for people to come and take on this project. The Minister knows in his heart there was no proper costing of that project and no proper assessment of its benefits. This was a political whim, like so many other spending projects that the Minister allowed his colleagues to embark upon. That was the sad truth of what happened. The public will suffer the hangover for this binge, not the Taoiseach. He will not make room in his Estimates to rectify this matter.The Minister came into the House week after week telling us he would meet his budget target. He said he would do so after the election and would work miracles. Then, gradually, he admit ted that maybe €300 million on the spending side has to be made good, but that he would battle on. Then, in respect of tax, he said we might lose €300 million, but would battle on. Then the figure became €500 million, then €1.3 billion. Week after week the story, which was so rosy before the election, became grimmer. He tells us spending will still come in at 14.4%. I had a look at what that would mean for Departments and what they would have left to spend in the last quarter of 2002 if each Minister was to come in on target. In nominal terms, not real terms, and not making any allowance for inflation, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to spend 2.2% less than it spent in the last quarter of 2001; the Department of the Environment and Local Government will have to spend 14% less; the Department of Education and Science will have to spend 1% less; the Department of Agriculture and Food, 52% less; and the Department of Health and Children, 3% less. The real binge was in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which will have to spend 33% less. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will have to spend 6% less.We have burned out the spending in the first half of the year trying to coax votes to come the way of the Government. If the Minister is serious about bringing the budget in on target, will he tell us how the Department of Health and Children will make another 3% nominal cut, a 10% real cut, in its last quarter? How will the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform make a 6% real cut and how will the Department of Agriculture and Food make a 60% real cut? The list goes on. I would like the Minister to tell us how these cuts will be achieved because we have not yet heard about the nature of the cutbacks. It will be one hell of an autumn if those cutbacks are delivered.No doubt the Minister will stand up in the House and reply that the growth we all thought would occur did not materialise. I took the trouble, and maybe some do not do so, to read back on the Budget Statements of 2001 and 2002. The Minister said what he believed would happen if growth did not reach the targets. Growth was two points short of what he expected. The impact that he predicted and stood over was that the general Government balance would be one point higher than he predicted. However, it was three points higher. It was obvious that the Government had lost control of spending and taxation at that point. The Department of Finance's model was collapsing. Again, in 2002, the Minister's prediction of growth at the time of the budget was 3.9%. His latest estimate suggests 3.6%, a difference of 0.3%. That would have been accompanied by a tiny deviation in the GGB, but the Minister has admitted it will be €1,600 million off target.Growth does not explain the way in which the public finances have deteriorated in recent years. As I set out in the charges earlier, one of the fictions on which the budget of 2002 was built was  the notion that one could dip into the deep pockets of the Minister who had little funds everywhere. He had the Central Bank reserve and the PRSI fund, which he raided quite happily. Like the highway robber, he was going to grab the benefit of notes that people did not cash. From the new coins that he issued, he was going to grab €370 million. There was great creative accounting, amounting in total to €3 billion. He brought forward the payment dates for corporation tax and self-employed tax. Every conceivable fund and trick was used to try to paper over the fact that he had an enormous underlying Exchequer deficit.However, he did not bank on the reaction of his friends in the EU. Barely was the ink on the budget dry when they told him in the run up to March that he could not use the euro changeover to gloss over his deficit. They ruled that out, and they ruled out more in June. The Minister did not let on that his carefully constructed edifice to conceal the deficit was crumbling away. The public was not told this, but it was quietly admitted in memos sent to the EU, acknowledging that he recognised that the edifice was collapsing. We are only now beginning to see what is happening.The Minister for Finance keeps telling us we are facing a tough year. I would like to know his opening statement. Since I have taken on this brief, I cannot believe the shambolic way in which he lays figures before the Dáil for approval: it is unbelievable. We do not get access to his projected profiles of public expenditure or tax. Therefore, we cannot track them from week to week. I have heard learned media commentators blaming the Opposition parties for not being able to track the fact tax and spending were going off line. The Minister refuses to publish the profiles of spending for the year ahead. If he did we could have proper transparency and accountability.I had great faith in the Minister that he would transform the way in which we framed our budgets, that he would have Estimates before the House three months before the start of the tax year and that he would have a whole new opus, but that has just not happened. On behalf of Fine Gael, I will move during this session a Private Member's Bill based very considerably on the New Zealand experience. They have brought in a fiscal responsibility Act. This is not the crude sort of thing that happens in California saying one must keep one's budget in balance. It recognises that there are cyclical ups and downs, but it sets out firm principles of sound public management. As I said earlier, the Government has abandoned the sound principles of public management of the finances, and it is necessary that we reinstate them.The House needs to assert itself. It is about time that the backbenchers on the Government side and the elected Members of the Opposition took back some responsibility. The Minister has doubled the spending on the health services is the past five years – that was his boast – but I do  not see any improvement in the quality of the health services in my constituency. Waiting lists are longer and it is harder to get speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The Minister has spent the money, squandered the boom that was created by Irish workers and we have nothing to show for it. It is about time the Dáil took back some responsibility and demanded accountability from Ministers, and I hope this will happen.Will the Minister state what will be the opening position next year? In last year's budget he forecasted an opening Exchequer deficit of nearly €3 billion for 2003. That did not take account of the fact that taxes crumbled by €1.3 billion, on the Minister's own admission. The figure pertaining to benchmarking is €1.1 billion. If there is a growth in spending, which the Minister predicts, an extra €1 billion will be required. Those figures show there will be a huge opening position. I would like to hear the Minister's estimate because it seems we cannot fund this easily without getting quite close to breaching EU restrictions. I heard the Minister proudly tell his colleagues yesterday that he would come in again with a balance this year and that he would have a small surplus. I do not see how he will do that against the background I have depicted. Perhaps it would be good if we had a little honesty from the Minister tonight.The public rightly feels conned by the scale of the misrepresentations of the past few months. It is time there was honesty rather than the guff about the state of the public finances we have heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister. We are being treated like fools and people will not accept that. I hope that from tonight there will be more honesty in the way proposals are framed and presented and that a true picture of where we stand is given.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Two years ago there was a budget surplus of £4.6 billion, or £4,600 million of hard earned taxpayers' money handed over to the Government in the belief it would be prudently spent investing in the future of the country and in building up the infrastructure. The Minister told us to open the champagne and many did so. The story was out that the good times were here, there was money for everyone and there would be no tomorrow. It was a story rigidly adhered to up to the date of the general election on 17 May.However, no sooner were the votes of the election counted then the story changed. Suddenly, the billions of euro had disappeared, filtered away buying an election. In what can only be described as a breathtaking U-turn, the new topic of conversation was the need for fiscal prudence. The money had mysteriously disappeared and the Government blamed everyone, including the trade unions, the hapless health boards, the  county councils and the construction industry, except those who had created the belief of endless resources and willingly solved every problem by throwing money at it.The present situation is like a return to the Charlie Haughey era when he told us to tighten our belts in the national interest. The people fell for that once but they will not accept it a second time. The Government bought the election with money it did not have and now the people will have to pay the price.Those who need a health service will pay the biggest price. The first act by the reappointed Minister for Health and Children was an attempt to claw back overspending by introducing charges. That was bad enough, but it was unforgivable of him to demand the return of money he had allocated to health boards on which they had based their budgets and much of which they had spent. What kind of way is this to run any business, much less a health service?The irony is that while the health boards were blamed for over-running their budgets, the Minister for Health and Children over-ran his Department budget by a massive €44 million, more than the amount of cut backs he was seeking from the health boards. They could have been avoided if the Minister had his act together.The medical card scheme for those aged over 70 years cost €32 million more than budgeted for because the Minister did not know how many people were in that age group. He then over-paid pharmacies and doctors by more than €12 million because he also lacked adequate records about them. How could a Minister conceive of spending €8,000 million annually and not have the most basic information about who and on what he needed to spend it? How can the same Minister, having made such gross errors, decide that the IT investment necessary to give him that basic information is no longer a priority? What private company would dream of spending that kind of a budget without the benefit of the most sophisticated and modern information systems? What executive of a private company, who by accident over-spent €44 million, would survive the next board meeting? Perhaps the Minister for Finance should have called the Minister to account, except that he was not in a position to do so, having himself lost €4.5 billion.It is time Ministers got off the fence and started to take control of their Departments. The Minister for Health and Children had hard decisions to make about the reform of the health service. He failed to take them when he had the funding at his disposal to make them less painful. He must now make them with less money at his disposal. He must establish priorities and tackle the fundamental structural defects in the health service that should have been addressed five years ago. Primarily, he should turn to the acute hospital service and start giving it some direction. It is soaking up countless millions every year and most of the health budget, yet the Minister appears to have washed his hands of the service.The Minister for Health and Children can no longer sit on the fence and watch the whole system go down the Suwannee. He cannot ignore situations such as that at Monaghan General Hospital, which is costing more to keep closed than when it was fully operational. Yet, no decisions have been made and money is being spent without any accountability. By failing to tackle reforms when the funding was available, we now have a health service that is on the brink of collapse. Sick people are paying and queuing for services. Of all the sections of society they are the people who will pay most for the Government's mismanagement of the healthy economy we handed over to it in 1997.The Government has secured a second term of office due to a gross and costly deception it perpetrated on the public, which it will not forget. It is not only the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who does not trust the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. The public is of the same opinion.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	495	It gives me no pleasure to speak tonight because there is great anger among the public. The Minister visited a number of colleges this week but the anger he encountered there is nothing compared to the anger on the ground. Decent people who have never complained before have expressed anger at what has happened. They are upset that the Government told them lies.These are not budgetary adjustments but cut backs. The Government knew what would happen but it did not have the courage to tell the people. Many Governments have fought general elections by telling people the truth. Deputy John Bruton did so in the early 1980s when his budget fell. People respect those who tell them the truth.In his Budget Statement last year, the Minister quoted from the television comedy "Yes Minister". I asked him about the programme "Bull Island". The Minister depicted on that programme is better than the Minister. At least we can laugh at him but the present situation is too serious for laughter. The people are angry and they are waiting to catch this Government. I hope they do not use the Nice referendum to express their anger.The people did not realise what would happen after the general election. Deputy Richard Bruton did not mention the Government's raid on the pension fund. Were it not for that we would be facing more problems. When providing free schemes for those aged over 70 years, the Government did not know the numbers in that age group, despite all the spin doctors and special advisers at its disposal. As a result, the schemes went over budget by €32 million, which is outrageous.The introduction of the euro has led to the people being robbed. There was a time when one would know what could be bought for £1, yet because the Government would not let down its friends in high places or those in the business  community everybody jumped on the euro bandwagon. It should have imposed a price freeze for 12 months following the introduction of the euro notes and coins. The poor on social welfare saw their benefit increases swallowed by the price increases in food, insurance and other living expenses. May Day was a bad day because since then, the price of electricity and everything else has gone up. One would think there was no Government and that we were actually watching "Yes Minister" in this House. It would be a joke if it was not such a serious matter and people are now paying the price.The rich have become richer. The Minister mixes with those people at race meetings in Punchestown and Galway and many other places. I am not a racing man. The Minister knows that was wrong. The Minister was a good guy when he first got into the ministerial car. He was somebody that I admired but power went to his head. As soon as he got into the ministerial car he began to look after the people he met at race meetings and forgot about the poor and the middle class.

People are fed up with price increases on a day to day basis and something has to be done.I say to the Minister for Finance and his Government that the people were deceived. What happened to the budget surplus that was in place two terms ago? It was squandered on the racing industry, the rich and all the Minister's friends in high places. Mr. Justice Flood was not bad and he knew what was going on. The people are waiting in the long grass for the Minister and his colleagues. They do not forget and they will not forget the Government in spite of all the spin doctors. I hope the Nice treaty does not pay the price for this.

I have long been a Member of this House and I have seen Governments come and go, yet the most cunning and deceitful act that I have ever seen perpetrated on the electorate happened last May. The people were conned and there is no other way of putting it.I smiled on seeing the Minister for Finance returning from the European Finance Ministers  meeting in Brussels the other day. Two years ago the Minister appeared there with his chest out and defied the best advice that was available that he was overheating the economy. From that time the Minister started to buy the middle classes. Money was dished out that we did not have. The Minister's return this week was a far cry from the previous occasion. As Deputy Bruton asked, what will the opening balance be like this time? How far down will we start? Who will be hurt next year? Who was hurt this year since the election? I do not have the time to go through everything in detail, but I assure the Minister of one thing, that there is great anger and I hope people do not take it out on the Government in the referendum on the Nice treaty. In Fine Gael we are going out of our way to try and get people to see that to do so would be to vote against the country. They can vote against the Government on another day.We might as well tear up the National Development Plan 2000-2006. There is no way the targets will be met. There is a 25% increase in the cost of the projects at this moment, which is not factored into the equation at all. The Minister can rest assured that some of the projects around Dublin will be completed, but what about regional development? What about the arterial roads that were to be built all over the country? They will not be built for ten or 15 years because the public private partnerships will only be interested in toll roads where the most cars can be found. We have a terribly depressing scenario in front of us.The Minister and his party will become known for only one thing after sleaze and the doings of Mr. Ray Burke – to which we will return tomorrow – and that is the belief that every problem could be solved by throwing money at it. There were no managerial skills nor was there a plan in place to control the situation. Now that the money has gone from the economy the Government has no answer for the problems of the day. When the history of this period is being written it will not look well for this Government. People are openly saying that not alone should the Taoiseach be got rid of but something which is unprecedented, they are speaking of getting rid of the Government although it is only a four or five months in office.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The Minister for Finance now admits that there is a €1.3 billion budget deficit. This is the first time we will have a deficit since 1977. Will the Minister explain to the Deputies in this House and to the general public how this happened? How did we get from a position of surplus to having a deficit? Only two or three months ago the Minister was predicting a budget surplus yet now we are in the opposite situation. The Minister has a great deal to answer for.The current rate of Government spending is 20% higher than it was at this time last year, in spite of the annual target being set at 14.3%.  Between now and the end of the year the public must prepare itself for more severe cuts than we have witnessed heretofore in order to achieve the set target. In spite of what the Minister might say these cutbacks will be in the major spending Departments in the areas of health, the environment and education.Overspending by the Government in the run up to the general election is at the root of the problem. Obviously the Ministers were allowed a free hand in order to buy their way in the election. It was announced in my own Western Health Board area in June that it was €13.5 million above budget. If that was the case in June then surely it was some €12.5 million above budget at the time of the general election yet nobody heard about it. Those facts were concealed from people and that is why they are waiting for an opportunity to vent their anger. As the two previous speakers said, I hope this does not negatively affect the referendum on the Nice treaty. The people will wait their opportunity in the long grass to get the Government.People fear further cutbacks in health. They fear being admitted to hospital because of the deterioration in the health services. Since the introduction of the new scheme to allow people on waiting lists to have their operations carried out privately, not one person in the Western Health Board area waiting for orthopaedic surgery has been able to avail of that scheme. I do not see how it can work in any case. How can work be hired out to consultants in private hospitals who are already working full time? Will they come in at weekends to carry out the procedures while the orthopaedic units in the Galway hospitals are closed at weekends? It is only another con job of pretending to reduce waiting lists. The largest such list is the one to get on the waiting list. Consultants in public hospitals no longer see patients to put them on waiting lists because it takes an average of five years to obtain an out-patient appointment. Therefore, people are not getting on waiting lists. Orthodontic waiting lists are the same and are five years' long in the Western Health Board area. It is a con job. People are not able to get on the orthodontic waiting list because the qualifications for being put on it are more severe than they were. I could go on if I had enough time, but unfortunately I do not. Will the Minister tell us in his reply how he let us get into this position?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"commends the Government for its continuing careful management of the public finances which, since 1997, has witnessed a transformation from decades of budget deficits to a succession of budget surpluses; welcomes the Government's commitment as indicated prior to the general election to  keep the general Government finances at least close to balance and notes the regular publication of detailed data since December 2001 on the evolving budgetary position in 2002."I am glad of the opportunity on behalf of the Government to respond to this motion and to ask the House to make clear its support for the Government's policy concerning the prudent and responsible management of the public finances. I also welcome the opportunity to deal with the allegation that the electorate was somehow misled on this issue.Before I go into more detail, I point out that until 1997 a surplus on the current side of the Exchequer was a rare event. Against this background the House should note that, even with borrowing of €750 million this year, there will once again be a surplus on the current side of several billion euros. Another relevant fact is that governments elsewhere in the European Union and outside it are experiencing more difficult budgetary positions and increasing deficits. According to recent officially reported data, the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole in 2002 will be about 2% of gross domestic product, against a target of 0.9% of GDP.The Government set out its policy concerning budgetary and economic policy in the programme for Government. In that, we stated clearly that we are committed to sustaining economic growth and maintaining full employment in the economy and that we see low inflation, responsible fiscal policies and effective investment policies as central to this; that we will keep the public finances in a healthy condition and we will keep personal and business taxes low to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the economy; and that the EU Stability and Growth Pact provides the overriding framework for our budgetary policy. The pact requires that we keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus and take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. This is a sound policy to which we should adhere even if the pact did not exist.I want to reflect briefly on the performance of the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government. During our five years in Government we reduced the general Government debt as a percentage of GDP from 74.2% in 1996 to 34% this year and, as a result, are paying €1 billion less in interest payments every year. This is money available for sustainable improvements in public services. Net spending by Departments almost doubled to €29 billion and the evidence is clear for all to see. We have the lowest ever class sizes, more than 4,000 additional doctors, nurses and other medical professionals delivering care, as well as dramatic increases in child benefit, pensions and a wide range of other badly needed improvements.

Those opposite may not like to hear this.They will also not wish to acknowledge the facts on how the budget position evolved during this year. I will set out clearly the information that was available to me since last December, and that was in turn made available to the public, regarding developments in the economy and the state of the public finances. It is important that the record on this be spelled out, and anyone who wishes can go to the Department of Finance and see the record. It shows that, while initial indications were disappointing, it was not unreasonable to believe before the end of May that budget targets were achievable. When the picture became clearer, I acted swiftly to reinforce control of spending.When presenting the budget for 2002 to the Dáil on 5 December 2001, I referred to the economic slowdown experienced in 2001 and repeatedly stressed the less favourable economic outlook and the uncertainty regarding the international economy. The budget day forecasts for the economy were for GDP growth of 3.9% and gross national product growth of 3.5%. It was clearly stated that budgetary policy for the three year period 2002 to 2004 was framed against the background of a weak international economy and  uncertainty about the timing and pace of recovery.

The IMF, OECD and European Commission forecasts were in the middle of this range and my estimates were in this range also. I pointed out that these forecasts represented our best estimate but that they were subject to the risk of variation given the uncertain international outlook. The budgetary projections included in the budget tables showed an Exchequer surplus of €170 million in 2002 but deficits of €2.98 billion and €3.682 billion in 2003 and 2004 respectively. I also pointed out that, given the uncertainty of economic forecasts, we would have to take stock of the situation again when it came to the budget for 2003. It is beyond me how anyone can claim that the facts about the budgetary picture for 2003 and 2004 were disguised or misrepresented. I repeat that the budget booklet is a public document and it clearly set out the projected borrowing figures for 2003 and 2004 months before 17 May.The forecast Exchequer surplus for 2002 of €170 million was based on an increase in tax revenue of 8.6% in 2002 and an increase in spending on services of more than 14%. From the beginning of this year I clearly and frequently stated my determination that the increase in public expenditure would be kept to target. Towards this end, I arranged a special meeting with Secretaries General of all Departments on 9 January 2002 to make it clear that Departments were required to manage within their post-budget allocations and that there would be no overall additional funding by way of Supplementary Estimates at the end of the year. I emphasised that the spending provisions in the Estimates and the budget represented the limit of what was affordable in terms of Government revenue in 2002.I explained that in the years 1997 to 2000 it had been possible to accommodate some overruns on the spending side because of higher than projected revenue receipts. I had sufficient flexibility within the overall Exchequer finances to sanction some additional investment in public services while continuing to maintain substantial budget surpluses. Even in 2001, when revenue came in well below target, I was ultimately able at the end of the year to sanction certain Supplementary Estimates and still report an overall Exchequer surplus. However, I made it abundantly clear to my audience that 2002 was different. I said the projected surplus was so small that there was no margin for overruns on spending and that revenue buoyancy was unlikely.I made it clear that new policy proposals must be funded within existing resources. It was also made clear to the Secretaries General that it  would be up to them, firstly, to meet the costs of any new policy proposals in 2002 from within their post-budget allocations and the means of achieving this would need to be spelled out in memoranda for Government.I also instructed my Department to put in place a new system of monthly expenditure management reports to Government on trends in spending and receipts, based on the information available from the end-month Exchequer statements. This was to ensure that as the year progressed the Government would have full and timely information on emerging trends and would be in a position to take decisive action if or when problems were identified to it.

Year-on-year tax receipts were 2.8% lower than the first quarter of 2001. However, this performance needed to be put in the context of the budget day changes, which were expected to boost tax receipts later in the year. In a note supplied to me, my Department referred to the increase in the standard rate of VAT and the change in corporation tax payment dates and stated that it was not proposed to reduce the 2002 budget day tax forecasts on this basis. The end of March returns showed an annual increase in spending of 17%. Although this was still above the 14% estimate for the year as a whole, it had moderated from the 22% year-on-year increases at the end of January and February. The end of year position was still projected to be an Exchequer surplus of €170 million – the same as estimated on budget day.Commenting on these results, I issued a press statement in which I welcomed the outcome in the context of the surplus projected for the year as a whole. I noted that the general expectation was that the economy was on the road to recovery and that this and the impact of several budget day tax measures should be reflected in tax revenues over the remainder of the year.

I also stated that the general expectation was that the economy was recovering and that this should be reflected in tax revenues over the remainder of the year. I again stated that spending plans by Departments were being closely monitored to ensure they came in on target.The Exchequer statement for end of April, published on 2 May 2002, showed an overall Exchequer deficit of €113 million. While on the revenue side tax receipts were 1.8% down on the same period in 2001, there were significant timing factors in the end of April returns. The consensus view was that there was no reason to move away from the budget day target for taxes.

This was affected by timing factors, including the 1% lump sum payments under the PPF and the carryover costs of budget and PPF measures. Even though spending was less than the spending profiles submitted by Departments at the start of the year, I again stressed that Departments had to manage their allocations to ensure that voted spending this year did not increase by more than the 14% provided for in the Estimates. I also asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report on the action to be taken to address emerging excess expenditure on prison officer overtime.After the submission to Government of the end of April expenditure management report, my Department initiated meetings with a number of Departments to emphasise once again the need to manage within approved allocations. These meetings were organised because it was sufficiently early in the year to take action on spending if there was a need to do so. It was also late enough in the year to form some reasonable picture of the end of year emerging outturn. This was particularly so, given the timing issues that had impacted on spending up to the end of April.At meetings with the Departments of Health and Children and Environment and Local Government, held on 9 May and 14 May respect ively, those Departments indicated that they were facing spending pressures on a number of programmes, which could result in overruns on their Votes.

The Revenue Commissioners in a note transmitted to the Department of Finance dated 5 June very tentatively put forward the view that taxes might come in some €300 million below target and the expenditure management report sent to Government on 10 June stated that a revenue shortfall this year of the order of €300 million needed to be factored in.At the end of May, the year-on-year increase in expenditure showed a sharp increase to 27% in comparison with a projected annual increase of 14% and this increased concern about the end of year spending outturn. In the first four months of the year, the year-on-year increases in overall voted spending by Departments, as published in the Exchequer statements, were January 22%, February 22%, March 17% and April 21%. In the expenditure management report, I referred to excesses of €300 million across a number of spending areas and I stated my concern that if these trends were not corrected that they would lead to a significant overrun this year. To ensure spending for the year came into line with the original planned increase some action had to be taken. Mid-year adjustments are a frequent occurrence and they happened on three previous occasions in my term of office.The Government agreed that additional funds would be provided to meet certain liabilities such as demand-led schemes managed by the Department of Health and Children, spending pressures in the Department of Environment and Local Government on roads and the homeless, extra costs of school supervision and substitution arrangements and additional spending on prison officer overtime. The Government agreed that, to ensure additional funds could be provided for these areas and yet stay within the 14% increase target, necessary expenditure adjustments would be implemented in a number of other areas. The Government agreed that Ministers and Departments would take immediate steps to address other emerging expenditure pressures.In the expenditure management report dated 10 June, I stressed that when funds are not available, they cannot be spent. Slower growth since  the record performance of the millennium year had slowed the pace of revenue increases and expenditure on public services had to be managed in a way which recognised this changing reality. Spending developments cannot ignore revenue developments. The essential first step in this direction was to ensure that this year's target of a 14% increase in spending was held. The budgetary prospect for 2003 was already daunting and overruns on this year's target would make it even more difficult.On 19 June, in a reply to a written parliamentary question, I stated that the forecast Exchequer balance for the end of year was still for a surplus of €170 million which was the budget day target. I made it clear again that I was determined that Departments would manage within their approved spending allocations. The Exchequer returns to end June, published on 2 July 2002, showed an Exchequer surplus of €507 million, with tax revenue down 7.1% on the same period last year. However, when adjusted for very substantial corporation tax payments received in the first couple of days of July, tax revenue was roughly at the same level as in 2001. I issued a press statement which noted the Exchequer surplus and that this was in line with achieving a surplus for the year, with extra non-tax and other revenues compensating for the shortfall in taxes that was then projected. The shortfall in taxes was estimated to be €500 million at that stage and this was clearly stated at the end-quarter press conference held by my Department on 2 July. Deputy Bruton attended the press conference and asked a question.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18105	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I have not been asked back since.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	523	In the end June expenditure management report dated 9 July, I pointed out to Government that spending was 22% ahead of the same period in 2001 and that this would restrict spending in the second half of the year to an increase of less than 9% year-on-year, to ensure that the spending targets were met.The Exchequer returns to end September published on 2 October 2002 showed an Exchequer surplus of €594 million, with tax receipts up 2.6% and voted current spending up 20.3% on the same period last year. My Department in consultation with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners revised the estimated tax shortfall to €1,300 million. The aim and expectation is still that net voted spending will come in on target. On this basis, the net end year position was estimated to be an Exchequer deficit of €750 million, with part of the revenue shortfall being offset by other revenues. Again, these details were clearly stated at the end quarter media briefing held by my Department on 2 October.Regarding the shortfall in tax revenues we have seen this year, tax revenues slow as economies slow. Our latest assessment is that economic  growth this year is slower than expected at budget time and while there is little hard data available yet, indications are that employment growth and earnings growth are below budget time expectations. There is evidence that overtime has been reduced and a general consensus that bonuses have been cut.The indications are that the international economy has not recovered as strongly as expected. Falls in equity markets and difficulties regarding corporate profits reporting, on top of difficulties in the IT and other sectors, have weighed on confidence in the US especially and hindered a global economic recovery. Similarly, European Union economic growth this year has been much weaker than expected, with practically no growth in the second quarter. This much weaker position was confirmed when ECOFIN met at the beginning of September, based on data available to the European Commission and other international commentators. The Commission confirmed that it would be significantly reducing its spring 2002 forecasts for growth this year and international prospects have not improved in the meantime.This weaker international economic environment has meant slower growth in Ireland. It was a main reason that, in the economic review and outlook published by my Department in August, our forecasts for 2002 were revised downwards to 3.6% for GDP compared to the 3.9% forecast on budget day and to 3% for GNP compared to the 3.5% forecast on budget day. We will be revising these forecasts again as part of our normal budgetary procedures.Lower growth leading to lower tax receipts has been a common experience in all the major world economies. For example, I understand that tax receipts in the United States have fallen by 10% year-on-year in the period to end July. Similarly, tax receipts in the United Kingdom are down 4%. The experience is similar in several other European member states where budgetary outcomes for 2002 are now expected to be weaker than originally forecast.As is usual at this time of year, my Department is reappraising the overall economic and budgetary prospects for 2003 and beyond. This appraisal will reflect the implications of weaker than expected tax receipts in 2002 and the weaker international prospect implicit in ongoing developments. This assessment will set the context for budget 2003.Regarding comments made about 2003 and beyond, it is normal in June of each year that my Department prepares a memorandum for Government on economic and budgetary strategy. This memorandum always takes into account the most recent macroeconomic and budgetary developments. The 24 June Memorandum on Economic and Budgetary Strategy 2003 to 2005 was no different. The memorandum stressed the high level of uncertainty regarding the performance of the international economy and referred to the prospect of a tax shortfall in 2002. As I indicated earlier, the 2002 budget book showed  a projected Exchequer deficit of €2.98 billion in 2003.The review of the economic and budgetary strategy by my Department of the 2003 position considered, among other things, the implications for spending against a very uncertain economic background. The conclusion reached was that if the potential bills for benchmarking and other spending areas were to be addressed, consideration would have to be given as to how economies in existing services could be secured so as to deliver a sustainable budgetary position. Accordingly, the Government agreed that Ministers should prepare their pre-budget Estimates proposals on the basis of securing economies of €900 million in existing services. It was recognised in that memorandum, which has recently come into the public domain, that this €900 million would be difficult to secure. That is why the Government in July asked three eminent former public servants to review spending proposals from all Departments and offices. They were given the difficult task of identifying all available options to achieve these economies. That exercise is ongoing as part of the 2003 Estimates process and the results will be brought to Government for consideration in due course.The 24 June memorandum reflected our adherence to the stability and growth pact requirement to keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. This shows prudent management of the public finances at work.In planning expenditure and budgetary strategy for next year it is entirely appropriate to review all areas of existing spending to see if resources can be freed up to deal with higher priority spending needs. Moreover, despite all the talk of cuts, it should be noted that the 24 June memorandum anticipated that post-budget total departmental spending in 2003 would increase by over €2.8 billion, or nearly 8% over 2002. Clearly, the outlook for 2003 has deteriorated further since then. In particular the outlook for tax revenue has disimproved considerably.What I have outlined shows the position in relation to alleged misrepresentation. When I received the information in June showing that the public expenditure targets might not be met, I immediately notified this to Government and recommended that action had to be taken. I have always made it clear that I expect the 2002 target of a 14% increase in spending would be met and that I would do what was necessary to achieve this. That is still the position. The records show not only that this Government has managed the public finances prudently but that prompt action was taken when needed and that new monitoring procedures for expenditure were introduced at an early stage. Regarding 2003, the record shows that the budget booklet which was published on budget day projected an Exchequer deficit of almost €3 billion in 2003.At the end of every month this year, as is usual, an Exchequer statement was published by my Department clearly showing the outturn for receipts and expenditure and the overall Exchequer position. In addition, at the end of every quarter this year there was a media briefing which gave details of the expected end year position on tax receipts, spending and the overall Exchequer position. This represents an open and transparent system of reporting to the public on the Exchequer's finances. Within this context, the allegation of misrepresentation cannot be sustained.We have seen how financial mismanagement brought this country close to ruin by the mid-1980s. We have seen how corrective action, prudent management and sound fiscal policies since then have been rewarded with unparalleled economic growth, employment levels previously undreamt of and higher real incomes for all our people. My track record is proven. No matter what way you look at it, in terms of general Government balances, debt levels or future liabilities, Ireland now has one of the strongest budgetary situations in Europe.I said repeatedly during the election campaign that I was determined to try to keep public expenditure to the increases announced earlier in the year. My determination in this regard remains undiminished. I said and I continue to say that I will take sound, sensible and timely action to safeguard and build on the solid financial position established in the public finances in the past few years. The House knows that if you do not have it, you cannot spend it, and I intend to stick to that rule. The Government will deliver as it did the last time but we will do so within realistic and sustainable fiscal parameters as put before and endorsed by the electorate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Sullivan, Moynihan-Cronin, Michael D. Higgins and Lynch. I will speak for ten minutes. Listening to the Minister for Finance it struck me that he is obviously a graduate – or should I say, a post-graduate – of the Enron school of accountancy. The Minister has been a popular Finance Minister who has preferred to pontificate about his own homespun right wing ideology than to manage the economy in line with any coherent set of economic ideas. Never was a Minister's arrogance so misplaced; never was the cost to the Irish people of such self-serving dogma so great.Deputy Quinn bequeathed this Government an economy with sound public finances, low inflation, growth taking off and rapidly rising employment. All Deputy McCreevy had to do was avoid messing it up but he flunked the test. The crisis in the Irish economy which we see around us is the direct result of his mismanagement, and crucially, his failure to accept the disciplines which monetary union demanded. With interest rates falling, he chose to fuel a consump tion boom through extravagant cuts in the top rate of tax. Rather than heeding warnings about the risks of over-heating the economy, he rubbished his critics and urged the public to "party on".However, it was not only through misguided fiscal policy that this Government brought us inflation at twice the EU average. Others in the outgoing Cabinet must also accept their share of blame. The Tánaiste talks a great game on competition policy but delivers little by way of results. The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is a clear condemnation of a Minister who talks the talk on competition policy, but does little that would cause the vested interests any real discomfort. We had the sad display of a Government that simply cannot deliver on infrastructure – on roads, rail, airports, public transport in all its forms, energy, housing, child care and health care.I wish to speak about roads. Government consultants have identified an astonishing €6.8 billion shortfall in the funding budget for the national roads programme. The national development programme allocated €9 billion for this programme for 2000 to 2006. Current budget difficulties were making it difficult for the Government to actually meet its commitments under this programme. In the special review commissioned by the Government, it emerged that the original estimates are hopelessly wrong and that the completion of the programme will require €15.8 billion. In other words, the programme is taking a double hit. There are inevitable cuts due to the present public finance outlook, the NDP's calculations are 75% out and the original allocation will come nowhere near to reaching the announced targets for new roads, bypasses and motorway intercity links.This is a policy disaster of enormous proportions. The national roads programme is the flagship project of the NDP. If it is 75% underfunded, then the whole NDP is in tatters and has no serious value as a planning tool to local authorities, business and industrial investors or local communities.This news will be greeted with dismay among investors in every sector of the economy. Our national roads have long been identified as the principal deficit in the country's physical infrastructure. The 2000-06 programme was broadly accepted as ambitious and necessary to achieve tourism and industry objectives. Any significant slippage will add to industrial and commercial costs at a time when there are major worries about Ireland's cost competitiveness and excessive inflation. I shudder to think what the implications are for rail and the much-vaunted metro for Dublin. This revelation is a direct indictment of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. It follows fast on the equivalent miscalculations of the cost of Abbotstown and the SSIA scheme. It all adds up to a picture of a Government incapable of doing its sums and meeting its programme within budget.There has to be a new approach if there is to be any public or investor confidence in the Government's capacity to deliver essential infrastructure projects. There appears to be an illusion that public private funding will enable these projects to be completed without too much added cost to the Exchequer. However, every additional euro will have to be met by the public, either in future taxes or in road tolls.I urge the Taoiseach to create an independent national plan commissioner with the direct task of overseeing accurate estimates of the true costs and to regulate the delivery of the works close to these estimates. Like the special savings fiasco, present Government cost overruns are set to saddle future taxpayers with truly oppressive burdens for little return in terms of new infrastructure.This Government engaged in a conscious and calculated pre-election expenditure splurge. The Minister's speech tonight is an apologia for how he managed the finances this year. He spent in the early part of the year and he is now going to trim back to 14% in order to come in on target for the whole year. For 18 months before the election, the Government threw taxpayers' money around like confetti in an attempt to buy votes. The only mystery is how it managed to spend so much money, with so little return in terms of improved public services. For that it stands indicted.With expenditure spiralling upwards and the effect of his tax cuts making themselves felt in lower revenues, deficits beckoned. However, this was something Deputy McCreevy could not bring himself to acknowledge. Instead he indulged himself in accountancy tricks and sleights of hand. While President Reagan in his time depended on right wing gurus such as Hayek or Friedman, Deputy McCreevy's inspiration is definitely Lewis Carroll. I do not think he has yet left the economic wonderland.We now know that the promise to protect the health service was casual deceit because the Minister knew the true state of the public finances as he made that promise. Fianna Fáil had no intention of delivering on its commitment to the electorate. It did not just run away from the truth, it embraced a pack of lies. It promised huge expenditure on health and other areas, with no price tag attached. There would be no new taxation, no deficits and no cutbacks. Fianna Fáil attacked anyone who suggested that deficits or higher taxes would be necessary, and it denied that cutbacks would be required. All the time the Minister knew that cutbacks were on the way and that deficits were inevitable.Savage cuts in public services are not necessary. There is a need for normal prudent spending control to be re-established, but the current onslaught on public services is not required. There are other options, including Government borrowing for infrastructural needs, or investing the funds already in the national pension reserve fund in capital projects. This is better than the  bizarre situation whereby, this year, the Government will invest €1billion, at least three-quarters of it borrowed, in the national pension reserve fund, a fund which, as the Minister is aware, has already lost half a billion euro on plummeting stock markets. This is Alice in Wonderland accounting. Equally bizarre is a Government spending more than €500 million on the SSIA scheme, which is having absolutely no effect on the level of inflation.There is also a need for an end to the relentless waste on the army of spin-doctors, advisers and consultants employed by this Government and an end to the endless supply of PR launches for every second thought of any Minister or agency. These launches are always accompanied by wine and catering, even in the middle of the day. I ask the Minister to give us all a break.Of the monuments to Deputy McCreevy's misplaced arrogance, the SSIA scheme is one of the most ridiculous. It typifies his refusal to accept advice, his attachment to tax breaks for the better-off and his recklessness with the public finances. I hope that, perhaps like St. Paul, he may one day be converted.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I listened to Deputy Richard Bruton and the Minister for Finance over the past hour and, like most economists who stand up to speak, unless another economist is listening, they usually lose their audience fairly quickly. That is not the fault of the person speaking; it is just a natural reaction.I would like to outline for the Minister some of the effects the adjustments, which this Government continues to describe them as rather than cutbacks, are having at local level. Approximately 18 months ago, a good programme called RAPID was launched by the then junior Minister, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in areas of particular disadvantage. At the outset it looked like a complicated process and it turned out to be such but, nevertheless, for the first time communities felt they had a chance to put in place plans which would benefit their area. These plans included simple things such as improving streetscapes, crèches, drop in centres and day care centres for the elderly – the type of things communities need to gel and to continue.For approximately one year until December 2001 these communities met regularly and put an enormous amount of effort into these projects. They felt very proud at the end of it. The Taoiseach's office then said the plans had to be on 18 December. We all knew there was an election coming. I felt from the outset, and said so at one or two meetings, that these were no more than population calming measures. There was no way a Government, no matter who was in power or how efficient it was, could possibly give an answer to these projects before a June election and not when one considered the amount of work which had gone into them and the number of communities involved.The plans were submitted, the communities sat back and then the co-ordinators were put in  place. The communities had to come together again to readjust the plans because they were told they included too many things, although they had been told to include the kitchen sink and so on in them. Some 18 months later nothing has happened regarding the RAPID programme. That has had a twofold effect. First, the communities which were supposed to benefit have not benefited and what they hoped for has not come to pass. Second, the people in these communities have lost confidence in their abilities and are extremely angry with this Government.

We are now told that we should only have read the first paragraph which said the rest of it was dependent on public finances. Therefore, the Minister should not have bothered publishing it all because it was a complete work of fiction.The Minister had the best opportunity any Minister for Finance has ever had to improve the lot of the have nots in this country.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The best economy was handed to the Minister by the previous Minister for Finance but he blew his chance. The Minister, having told us that we would have a profit this year, now tells us we will have a deficit of €750 million at the end of this year. We are now being told people have to tighten their belts. I do not know how the Minister could have got it so wrong and how he could have wasted the opportunity to bring this country up to decent levels of basic income and public services. Unfortunately, it will be the people who should have received a lift in the good years who will suffer most again in what has now become a downturn. Figures released in the last few days show that the gap between the haves and the have nots has increased dramatically during the tenure of this Minister.I do not know if the Minister knows that people on disability allowance, for example, got a rise of £8 per week which brought them up to the grand total of £93.56 – we were dealing in pounds at that time – which is €118.80 per week. I do not know how people are expected to live on that kind of income and to cope with the rising inflation we now have on the most basic items.People with disabilities were promised that they would get rights based legislation more than five years ago in a previous Government manifesto from the Minister's party. That promise remained unfulfilled for five years. Now the Minister has cut what was an allocated budget to health boards at the beginning of this year. I am a member of a health board and we were given a budget which was cut. I do not care if the Minister uses the term "adjustment" or "cut" but the budget was cut and health boards have now had to cut things like aids and appliances for people with disabilities. We were promised rights based legislation, which the Minister's Department strongly resisted saying the country could not afford to give people rights, and now we have been promised that this legislation will be published next year. I am not holding my breath at this stage because we are having cutbacks at a time when we should have been giving rights to people living on basic incomes.We have reached a stage when, unfortunately, we will probably not be able to afford to fulfil these promises. That is down to the Minister's handling of the economy and to cohorts in the Progressive Democrats whose policies are responsible for this. The consequences of mismanagement are cuts which will hurt the old, the sick and the poor and that is the harsh reality of the deliberate decision to prioritise in favour of the haves. There have been special tax deals and the better-off have been looked after. In the meantime, there has been this myth that one could do that while, at the same time, spending on public services and bringing them up to the level my colleague Deputy Burton spoke about.Unfortunately, this miserable second book will be written by the Minister. He has wasted the opportunity to bring about the kind of changes people in this country expected. We live in a  society as well as an economy but, unfortunately, because of the mismanagement of the economy, our society is left in a situation where we have, in some ways, the worst public services in Europe. We have nearly the lowest public spending in areas like health, education and social services. The opportunities, however, were there. We had budgets and coffers which were bulging but, unfortunately, that money was not spent in the areas in which it should have been spent. We now have figures which indicate that we will borrow more money than is being put aside for the pension fund and the special savings scheme next year and at a time when the money being put away on the stock market is losing. It seems a crazy decision to put money away for the year 2025 while having to borrow to pay for it. At the same time we are cutting back on badly needed public services. There is no doubt that people cannot afford a house today who could have afforded one before this Government came to power.

It is a scandal that an economy that was working well, in surplus, balancing and within the parameters set by the EU, has been squandered and is in trouble again. It is scandalous in terms of the kind of society that has been developed over the last five years.

In page 3, to delete lines 15 to 32, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following:"1.–In this Act, ‘legal instrument' includes any directive, regulation, framework decision, decision or convention that is made or drawn up by the Council of Ministers, regardless as to whether–(a) the proposal for that instrument is made by the European Commission or, in relation to co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs or on common foreign and security policy, is made on the initiative of a Member State, or(b) the making of that instrument is subject to co-decision by the European Parliament or otherwise.”.Sinn Féin appreciated the positive intent of the provisions in the original Bill, tabled by Deputy Quinn, particularly regarding the increased Oireachtas scrutiny of EU legislation and the actions of Ministers within EU bodies. We wel comed the attempt to clarify and codify that Irish Defence Forces may only participate in overseas operations with UN forces and only after approval by the Oireachtas. Such clarification is necessary, even if we do not agree with how these portions of the original Bill were drafted. We opposed in the strongest possible terms both the Government amendments and the Labour Party's subsequent capitulation to the gutting of its Bill on Committee Stage last week. Given that we had our concerns about portions of the original Bill, as expressed on Second Stage, this puts us in the unenviable position of having to argue for large portions of the original Labour Party Bill as it has forfeited that right.We, therefore, have tabled Report Stage amendments that restore large parts of the Bill that were positive and, combined with additional amendments, deal with the serious concerns raised on Committee Stage about inadequate limitations on ministerial discretion, which is a major contributor to the democratic deficit identified in relation to the conduct of EU business and our concern about the introduction of clauses that would in effect legislate Ireland's participation in the Rapid Reaction Force and Partnership for Peace, which is a further threat to our neutrality. We support full scrutiny by the Oireachtas of all EU legislation to the extent that sections 1 to 5 of the original Bill attempted to include all EU legal instruments as objects for scrutiny. These provisions needed to be strengthened which is what we are trying to achieve in this amendment. We oppose the amendments made to section 1 on Committee Stage.Given our concerns for the inclusive and comprehensive definition of legal instruments for the purpose of this legislation, the Bill's definition of "measure" is unduly restrictive and unacceptable. In specifically referring to Articles 14 and 15 but not to 30, 31, 32 and 33, the Bill both excludes justice and home affairs, and common foreign and security policy. These areas must come under full scrutiny. The people have made their concern about this matter very clear. The attempt to shield these areas from enhanced scrutiny is reinforced in the deletion of the provisions in the original section 5 of the Labour Party's Bill which made specific reference to applying scrutiny provisions to common foreign and security policy. This is further reinforced by section 3 which enhances ministerial discretion by exempting measures from scrutiny which are, in the Minister's opinion, confidential. We want to ensure that no opportunity for scrutiny is forfeited under this legislation.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I welcome the opportunity on the Government's behalf to deal with the Report and Final Stages of this important legislation. The Government attaches great importance to addressing public concerns relating to democratic accountability on EU issues and looks forward to working with the Oireachtas in  pursuit of this key objective. The new scrutiny arrangements which have been in place since 1 July will, if effectively implemented, give Ireland one of the most advanced systems of parliamentary oversight in the EU. The Government's aim in progressing this legislation is to place new scrutiny arrangements on a formal legislative basis. I pay tribute to the Labour Party on its initiative in tabling this Bill.There are a number of other provisions in the current administrative arrangements for enhanced Oireachtas scrutiny, notably briefing in advance by Ministers of Council and European Council meetings, which will, of course, continue but which it is not proposed to include because such arrangements are not appropriate to legislation. The Government also intends to provide information notes on Commission Green and White Papers to the Oireachtas. This is not specifically in the Bill as its focus is essentially on legislative instruments.A number of amendments have been put down which are not appropriate to this Bill, in particular those related to the Defence Acts which are the responsibility of the Minister for Defence and are separate and distinct from the issue of Oireachtas scrutiny of EU affairs. Issues related to defence and Ireland's policy of military neutrality are fully covered by the Seville Declarations and the proposed constitutional amendments, which in effect preclude Ireland from entering a common EU defence.As someone who has represented the Government on many councils over the years, I welcome this initiative as it is necessary to have such transparency. The Sinn Féin amendment to the Government amendment accepted on Committee Stage is a copy of section 1 of the original Bill. As stated then by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Government amendment sets out clearly the measures to be covered by the legislation and these include regulations in the first pillar, joint actions and common positions in the second, and all measures requiring the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.6º of the Constitution which embraces third pillar framework decisions and conventions. The terms "European Communities" and "Minister" are also defined in the section while the text in section 1(2) is defined to provide legal clarity to references to a section, subsection or paragraph and an enactment. Section 1 is the text agreed on Committee Stage and clearly sets out the measures to be covered by the legislation and so I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	541	In the first instance, the Labour Party is committed to the committee process in legislation, and it was our intention to take the work of the committee seriously. Our spokesperson participated on Committee Stage and listened to the arguments put forward. Some of the changes agreed to by the Labour Party were on  the basis that we wanted to have legislation that could be in place and that possessed legal certainty. We acceded to such arguments put forward such as, for example, that other legislation might be more appropriate to some of what we sought in the original Bill, as initiated. For example, it is appropriate to amend aspects of the Defence Act, 1963.The Bill, as introduced, was part of a set of measures introduced by the Labour Party. The Labour Party produced its concept of the forum which allowed Members to express their concerns and different views, not only about Europe's past and present, but also about its future shape. We are proud we introduced the concept of the forum and participated in it. We argued strongly in favour of a constitutional amendment on neutrality which was agreed with the Government. Having agreed with the Government on a constitutional amendment which will be part of what will be put to the people on 19 October, it behoves us to operate in good faith in terms of its consequences. The amendment on neutrality, if adopted, clearly makes redundant some of that which we had originally suggested, an issue which I will come to in later amendments.As regards the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill, we were anxious that the deficit which had emerged through the discussion on the forum be met. We were also anxious to have legislation that could be agreed with the Government. That is the background to the Labour Party's position on these amendments.With regard to amendment No. 1, as I am substituting for Deputy Wall, who cannot be present for personal and family reasons, I can be frank and say that the achievement on the three dimensions I have mentioned – the forum, the specific reference to neutrality in a constitutional reference and the Bill before the House – was the outcome of a considerable amount of negotiation on the part of the Labour Party and those with whom we were dealing. That having been the case, we have an obligation to respect the agreements reached and to listen to the will of the committee which dealt with this issue on Committee Stage.When I read the amendment and look at the definition of "legal instrument", it would be my construction that what is being sought is incorporated in the text before the House, and that the amendment is, therefore, not necessary. A further point which the mover of the amendment may not find attractive is that in the event of a "Yes" vote on 19 October, I imagine that a European Communities Bill will have to come before the House. With regard to the other parts of the amendment, there will be an opportunity to address many of these issues should they remain outstanding.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Labour Party has done the State a considerable service in circulating its original Bill, the European Union Bill, so shortly after the original Nice referendum on 7 June  2001. It focused on an issue which was of considerable relevance to the people in deciding not to adopt Nice on that occasion. That was the very clear, absolutely disgraceful, democratic deficit that existed at the time. From that point of view the Bill as remodelled from Committee Stage is something we should heartily commend to the people. It is said that every cloud has a silver lining. One of the good by-products of the failure of the Government to get the Nice referendum through is that we now have an approach which involves addressing the democratic deficit. The way to do this is through the Oireachtas and its committees. That is the reason I am delighted to be involved in the European Affairs committee at this time in a new type of format. In the past, the relevance of being involved in such a committee was somewhat problematic. We now have a situation where Ministers come before the committee before going to the Council of Ministers. It may be a nuisance for them. I attended meetings of the Council of Ministers for about five years and I would probably have regarded it as a nuisance had I to come before the committee. If that is what needs to be done to connect Europe with the people, it has to be done. That is why this is such a good Bill.Today the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, came before the European Affairs committee. He is attending a meeting after the weekend of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. We went through every item on the agenda. That meant there was an opportunity for an input from Parliament. We have formalised in a statutory shape a requirement for proper scrutiny of proposals from Europe. I heartily endorse it and see it as a beginning.Having received a letter from you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on an amendment I have tabled, I hope this is the beginning of a process. It should not be the end of a process. There will be further referenda to confront. Unless we can show we are up to date and prepared to continue to mediate what is happening in Europe to our people, we will lose out. I am confident that, having seen the new approach regarding Europe, the people will vote sensibly on 19 October and adopt the Nice treaty as being in the national interest. There is no doubt about that.From the point of view of the democratic deficit, the scrutiny of what is coming from Europe and what is involved in the European stage, let us consider this as the beginning of the process. I will not press the particular view I hold at present, but I will do so in the future, namely, that all appointments to Europe should be vetted by the European Affairs committee. All appointments, proposals to appoint commissioners, judges, auditors and so on should be vetted by the European Affairs committee. I would like any proposed appointee to come before the European Affairs committee and I see that as the next stage.I understand for procedural and other reasons, not least the Opposition or the Government, that,  as of now, there might be a difficulty in having that incorporated in the Bill. My plea to the House is to have a real understanding of where we are at. We are at the beginning of the road so far as the democratic deficit is concerned. Let us see it as the beginning of a process whereby the Houses of the Oireachtas and, in particular, the European Affairs committee will be increasingly involved in discussing, in advance as far as possible, the proposed decisions that will emerge from Europe in the future. That is the reason I originally supported the Labour Party proposal. I accept that the Bill as remodelled and recast is probably as much as any Government could accept at this stage. All I ask is that the Minister agrees that the Bill, which will be put through the House tonight, is the beginning of the process rather than the final legislation to be put in place from the point of view of the democratic deficit and scrutiny of European proposals.

Recently, the European Affairs committee, which was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, had an excellent debate on this Bill. He dealt at length with virtually every section of the Bill. I also wish to join the Minister in congratulating the Labour Party for having initiated this Bill in the last Dáil and I commend the Government for adopting it. It is not the first time a Government has adopted an Opposition Bill and it is a good practice where there is merit in the Bill proposed, as there clearly is in this case.I have already received my first scrutiny file for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. I have a baleful of scrutiny documents – proposed EU laws, directives and decisions that the scrutiny committee—

It will refer some of it to other committees of the Oireachtas. In certain other cases it will decide that no further action is required, and it will make appropriate decisions along the line. It is great that we are now arriving at the situation where that democratic deficit is finally being addressed.I make no apology for saying that there is a need for debate on European issues. There is a need for debate on the future of Europe. I believe the Forum on Europe is only the beginning of that debate in Ireland, and I also believe that the Convention on the Future of Europe, under the chairmanship of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, is only the beginning of that debate in Europe. Nobody is ever going to stifle debate on the future of Europe. When the debate ends, the whole project will be at an end. That is not to say there are not problems, and nobody should ever deny there are  problems or that there are issues of concern to people.The first issue I highlighted at the Committee on European Affairs was that of prices to the consumer and the lack of competition. I am referring to the price of bread, butter, car insurance, motor cars, spaghetti, wine – the bread and butter issues that are of primary concern to the people of Europe.In so far as I am a member of the scrutiny committee, I will reject any bit of mumbo jumbo or rubbishy proposals that come before me because I believe it is high time the European Union got a dose of common sense, brought reality to its proceedings and made the whole European project more important and more relevant to the ordinary people of Europe. That has nothing to do with Nice, it is not controversial at all. People support Europe in general but they want a Europe that is listening and that is relevant. It is important for the scrutiny committee to keep its focus on the issues that are relevant to people – the quality of the environment, the price of goods, standards in health and other services and equality of rights. These issues are very important.If I see on the scrutiny committee that the EU is debating at length the trajectory of a banana or the size of proposed new grapefruits I will be very upset indeed. That is where the European Union is capable of running off the rails and not addressing the central issues.I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, that the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill, 2001, is an excellent Bill, and as a member of the committee I wish to thank the Government for providing the resources necessary. This can be quite a technical issue, a matter that has been raised at the Committee on European Affairs. Some of these documents are very technical and intricate and we may need resources. I do not mind putting it on the record of the House that the scrutiny committee may need more resources.

However, it is necessary to put it on the record that the majority feeling at the recent meeting of the Committee on European Affairs was that the Bill, as proposed, is an excellent Bill and will readily address the democratic deficit we have all identified.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	548	My party is not a member of the Committee on European Affairs and it was our intention to move amendments on Report Stage. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Government chose to move amendments that we would have been prepared to move ourselves in the defence area, maybe for different motivations but for the same good effect, we would argue.The original Bill tried to do two things. First, it attempted to address to some extent the democratic deficit which exists in the European Union, as it exists in political systems throughout the western world. Second, it attempted – incorrectly in our opinion – to address defence and security issues in a legislative way. We felt this was totally the wrong road to go down. The Government has made its amendments, it has been accepted by the committee and it is not an area we need to debate.As regards the amendment moved by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, we would be in agreement with it and the sentiment behind it. For the House to be self-congratulatory and assume that this Bill in itself addresses the democratic deficit would be a big mistake because parliamentary scrutiny is very much down the line in terms of addressing the question of the democratic deficit.The democratic deficit exists in political systems because of people's lack of identification and subsequent lack of engagement with democratic structures. Where the institution has no real democratic structures at all – which is the case with the European Union as it is currently constituted – this is a real problem. This is entrenched by the type of attitudes seen in our referendum campaign. When people are asked to engage in European issues, they are being asked to do so by a mixture of fear and pity rather than dealing with the constructive aspects of the European Union, what it can be and what it can be developed into.The fact that we lack this type of maturity in our political debate makes it all the poorer, and it is the reason we are failing to interact in a proper way with the potential of the European Union. The democratic deficit is expressing itself in a lot of ways, and people who feel the public is suddenly going to engage, or is starting to engage, in a positive way would be wise to see much of the public reaction as simply a case of telling us in the political establishment – in this House and in the European Union – what we want to hear. That is not real engagement. I get a sense that people are either indifferent or will say anything just to get the political establishment out of their hair. That is to our own detriment as people involved in the political process and it is ultimately to the detriment of democracy itself within this nation and the European Union.I would have hoped that with this Bill – and I am saddened not to see it – we would see a whole raft of proposed legislation as to how the real democratic deficit can be addressed. There is a need for structures where people can seek information and become properly informed and more involved in decision-making processes. Then perhaps we can talk about the reality of a European Union that does not have a democratic deficit. This is such a tiny corner of what needs to be covered that we are really deluding people that the question of the democratic deficit is being tackled at all.Until we can get that sense of a public that identifies with us in our role within a European Union then this Bill is a poor substitute. I hope that amendments like this will raise further discussion and further thought-provoking ideas, and, ultimately, that we would come up with the type of legislative programme that will meet the real need that exists in Irish political life and in the political life of the European Union.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I wish to thank the Deputies for their contributions and, in particular, Deputy Ó Snodaigh for putting down his particular amendment and his own contribution here and at the Forum on Europe, an organisation of which he is a very active member.Deputy Higgins is correct. Three things have happened, and they were echoed by Deputy O'Keeffe. We have had the establishment of the Forum on Europe, the neutrality issue has been dealt with and we have now introduced this scrutiny legislation. They can be regarded as three historic developments, but as someone who has been active in European politics for some time in various ministries, I am at one with those who said that we need much more transparency and scrutiny. Deputy O'Keeffe was right when he said that this is only a start, and we all have to remember that in the months ahead.Deputy Higgins was right when he said there will be a requirement for further legislation following the passing of the Nice referendum. A short European Communities amending Bill will follow in the event of any treaty being passed, but we now have the makings of an advanced system of parliamentary oversight.There is no question that this is a wake-up call for Europe as well as this country because, in my discussions with many Ministers over the past number of years, they have all said that there is an information deficit, to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, and confusion among citizens. We want to connect with the citizens of Europe in an honest, open way. In that regard, while canvassing last night it was refreshing for me to listen to a young person aged about 18 or 19 discuss with me on the doorstep the changes in the qualified majority voting and enhanced co-operation. I assure the House there are not many people throughout Europe, and I have heard this directly from Ministers, who have that kind of knowledge. Questions and concerns remain but many people are very well informed thanks to the efforts of everybody involved. My main hope is that people, regardless of their view, will vote on 19 October. I hope Deputy Ó Snodaigh will accept my assurance that we have tried to encompass his concerns in our amendment.

Tá mise ar an rogh-choiste a bhaineann le cúrsaí Eorpacha, chomh maith le Teachtaí Mulcahy, Jim O'Keeffe agus Kirk. Tá an-obair á dhéanamh ag an gcoiste agus beidh a thuilleadh oibre á dhéanamh amach anseo. Caithfimid tacaíocht a thabhairt don bhfóram ar an Eoraip agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé ar siúl nuair atá conradh Nice curtha chun codladh againn.D'éirigh leis an bhFóram dul timpeall na tíre agus ceist na hEorpa a ardú. Ba cheart go ndéantar dian-scrúdú ar gach uile rud a thagann os comhair an Tí seo agus os comhair an rogh-choiste ar chúrsaí na hEorpa ach go háirithe. Is trua nach bhfuil an Bille atá os ár gcomhair chomh foirfe leis an mBille a chuir Páirtí an Lucht Oibre os comhair an Tí. Is trua nach bhfuil na leasaithe atá á moladh ag páirtí s'agamsa inghlactha ag an Rialtas. Is botún é sin ag an Rialtas.It is unfortunate that my amendments do not appear to be acceptable to the Government because their intention is to increase democracy in Europe and ensure full scrutiny of every issue dealt with by this House. The original section 2 of the Bill was deleted and our amendment No. 2 proposes to restore it unaltered. For legislative instruments without prior consultation with the Oireachtas, the retention of this section, as originally drafted, is crucial in the interests of transparency and accountability. It is essential to  rectify our domestic democratic deficit with respect to EU affairs.The proposals in the Bill as it now stands are totally inadequate and render the exercise tokenistic, at best. I am not convinced that there is significant improvement on the provisions and practices that currently exist. We particularly object to the idea that the Minister should only have regard to recommendations made to him or her, under section 2(2), and the provision that the Minister can decide not to consult, under sections 2(3) and 2(4). We object also to the unwarranted increase in ministerial discretion provided for in section 3 which allows a Minister to forego reporting requirements if it is in his or her opinion that the proposed measure is confidential. What kind of legitimate legislative instrument or measure is confidential and above public scrutiny? That is not the type of accountability the Irish public seeks.The Bill also prevents the application of judicial scrutiny to Common Foreign and Security Policy. That is wrong. The Bill before the House scuppers the original intention of the legislation as tabled and makes a mockery of the spirit and intent of the original Bill. It does not amount to scrutiny, transparency or accountability. Indeed, it actively undermines these objectives. The limited provisions for reporting are not good enough. They do not satisfy the test for transparency and accountability intended in the original Bill.We raised this issue on Committee Stage and while I could not be in attendance to move my amendments, my colleague did a good job in trying to explain our position on this matter. The explanation offered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for gutting the original Bill was that it was unconstitutional. Subsequently, my office pressed the Minister to specify the area that was unconstitutional and the reply was that the original section 2 prevented Ministers from agreeing to any proposal for a legal instrument prior to consultation with the Oireachtas. Section 3(2) in the original Bill preventing the Minister from accepting a proposal if a resolution rejecting it was passed by the Oireachtas was unconstitutional under Article 29 as it would "interfere with the Executive function of the Government" and thus with the separation of powers.There are several problems with this. Firstly, I must protest that this legal opinion should have been made available to the committee for consideration; failing this, the committee should have solicited an independent legal opinion on the constitutionality of the draft under consideration. It was not acceptable that we should have merely taken the Minister's word for it. In the Constitution, Article 29.4.2º specifically allows the conditions to be determined by law. Nothing in the Constitution prevents us from keeping Ministers to account. It is not, therefore, a clear matter of unconstitutionality of the original Bill as drafted.  I hardly think the Labour Party would have drafted a Bill that was unconstitutional – I would be shocked if it did.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	554	We are dealing with six amendments, four of them in my name. Amendment No. 3 is an amendment to section 2, which deals with the scrutiny of measures by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am generally in favour of the section as it is currently cast, which provides that as soon as practicable after a measure is proposed by the Commission or initiated by a member state, the Minister must cause a text to be laid before each House together with a statement from the Minister outlining the content, purpose and likely implications for Ireland of the proposed measure. That makes absolute sense. What I want to change in subsection (1) is the words "including such information as he or she considers appropriate". I had thought to improve the Bill by suggesting that instead of giving statutory discretion to the Minister to include such information as he or she considers appropriate, the Minister should instead provide such other information as is necessary to facilitate effective scrutiny of the proposed measure by Members of the Houses. I was trying to shift the emphasis to greater objectivity so that, rather than the Ministers deciding what is appropriate, the information must pass objective criteria.My next amendment is along similar lines. The section goes on to allow the Minister to have regard to any recommendations made to him by the Houses or a committee of the House, and then provides that those two subsections will not apply if, in the opinion of the Minister, there is insufficient time for the carrying out of the procedures laid out in subsections (1) and (2). The performance of the functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas are also mentioned. That is a statutory escape hatch. I can envisage circumstances in which emergency proposals might prevent the Minister from going through the procedures outlined in the section, but I felt that in that situation there would be a particular onus on the Minister to take the further step which I have proposed in amendment No. 4. That provides that where the Minister is unable to comply with subsections (1) and (2), he shall make a report to the Houses or a committee of the Houses setting out his reasons for his opinion under that subsection. This amendment is designed to put a little more pressure on the Executive in situations in which a Minister – a Fianna Fáil Minister in the short term, but hopefully not always – could not comply with the terms of the section.The other amendments, briefly, relate to section 3. It is clear that section 3 exempts the Minister from the requirement to lay all this information before the House where, in the opinion of the Minister, the proposed measure is confidential. Again, I can envisage such situations in which it would not be in the national interest to have a proposal made public until discussion of it had been completed and some decisions  arrived at. If, however, we do give that discretion to the Minister, there should be a statutory requirement that the Minister report to the Houses why he considers such a proposal to be confidential. That report may be made subsequently. The Bill at present merely provides that when subsections (1) and (2) of section 2 do not apply to a proposed measure the Minister may make a report to the Houses. It would be appropriate, if the Minister feels that he needs to be exempted from the provisions of the Act, that he should be statutorily required to make a report to the Houses. My proposal provides that instead of the Minister's being entitled to make a report to the Houses, he must make a report, changing the provision to an imperative.Amendment No. 7 is along the same lines. As the Bill is currently framed, the Minister is allowed to make a report to the Houses "as he or she deems appropriate in the circumstances."  That allows too much discretion to the Minister. The national interest must come first, so the Minister must be released from the terms of the Act where there is an emergency situation or a confidential proposal – I can envisage such circumstances because I have dealt with them myself. There should then, however, be a statutory requirement that the Minister report to the House why he considered that the situation was an emergency or confidential.I am trying, in putting forward these proposals, to be constructive while shifting the balance of power a little towards the Legislature rather than the Executive. I do not have much confidence that the Government is in the mood to accept them at this stage, but I did say at the beginning that from the point of view both of future developments in this area and of the proposal, I feel very strongly about vetting appointments and proposed appointees coming before the committee and other such extensions of the powers of the Oireachtas and the Committee on European Affairs, and I hope that I am laying the foundations for the future in sections 2 and 3 and that these are aspects in the process that will be considered in the future. It is in that spirit that I propose these amendments.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I am conscious that we are on Report Stage and most Members had an opportunity of making a contribution on Committee Stage. Perhaps we did not have the focus of a plenary session, but at least we had it in committee. There was a very good exchange and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was never reluctant to engage with other Members. As Deputy O'Keeffe will vouch, many of the points he is making were responded to more than adequately on Committee Stage.On the point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh regarding the constitutional consideration, my recollection is that the Minister outlined, first, the responsibility of the Executive and, second, the responsibility of Parliament.The Committee on European Affairs is a very active committee of the Oireachtas. It will have a very important and busy role when we get into the business of scrutinising EU directives and regulations. Perhaps it would be no harm to focus on the capacity of the committee as a structure to handle the provisions envisaged in the legislation. It is intended that, where appropriate, there will be a diversion of directives and regulations for consideration to other committees of the Houses. It goes without saying that there will be a great need for specialist backup for committees if the intended objectives of the legislation are to be met. At this point we should pay tribute to the Labour Party for its input into the proposals contained in the legislation.At a time when the phrase "democratic deficit" is mentioned on a regular basis, the legislation goes a long way to meet the perceived shortcomings in this area. This will put a considerable workload and pressure on committees of the Houses. It will test their resolve to see these matters through to their inevitable conclusion. A number of Members currently in the Chamber were in attendance at today's meeting when we had an early experience of how matters will work when we get down to the business of scrutinising issues. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, attended and a whole range of issues due to be considered at a Council meeting on 13 and 14 October were discussed. We spent some time on a whole range of issues and it is fair to say that the Minister responded very adequately. Members of the committee showed their ability to anticipate what was contained in the proposals which will come before the Council meeting in three or four days.This is just the first experience of what will be a significant workload in the months and years ahead. A great responsibility will rest on the membership of these committees. It may be that the arrangements for committee sittings in the Houses generally may have to be looked at. The question of committee meetings taking place during a plenary session of the Dáil when people must keep one eye on the monitor and the other on the debate in the particular committee room may not be the most satisfactory way to deal with what we are talking about in this debate.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I will be brief because I appreciate Members wish to discuss other amendments.Ba mhaith liom a rá ar dtús go gcuireann sé áthas orm an Teachta Ó Snodaigh a chloisteáil ag labhairt i nGaeilge i gcónaí. Ós rud é gur thagair sé don mBunreacht féin, caithfidh mé an pointe seo a dhéanamh.Deputy Ó Snodaigh is absolutely correct to suggest that Article 29.4.2º clearly suggests there is no impediment whatsoever to holding a Minister to account. Unfortunately, constitutional theorists would suggest that certainty is the value above all others that constitutions must have. Draftspersons and constitutions would follow cer tainty by suggesting that brevity in language is the best instrument for achieving certainty. However, as it is passed into legislation and as I respond to amendments Nos. 2 to 7, one must ask in regard to the amendment, while it might have considerable merit, whether it confers legal clarity in interpretation and whether it will deliver legal clarity. I believe that is the case in regard to amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe in what he is seeking to achieve.I urge the Minister in his response to this group of amendments to give an undertaking that he will return to this issue in future legislation, for example, in accommodating the European Communities Bill, depending on the referendum results. For example, Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment No. 4 addresses the issue of where the balance of discretion should lie. He is anxious not to impede the exercise of discretion solely in terms of the Minister. Equally, the European Union has been considerably disabled by what one might call the technicist fallacy, that is, the issues of discretion are, in fact, technical ones. It is not acceptable that one would remove from Parliament the exercise of discretion. This is a matter to which we must return. Deputies are correct to say the new scrutiny committee will require resources. One way of completely ruining the scrutiny committee is to dump on it a whole series of documents without comment or the resources to go through them. Scrutiny requires resources.Amendment No. 6 refers to "may" and "shall". "Shall" presumes a certainty and precise location of the exercise of discretion. I have sympathy with Deputy O'Keeffe on this issue which I believe should be resolved. I do not think it could be resolved easily in this legislation because it would assume that where the discretion lay is, in fact, obvious. There is a further problem. One will have to change completely the report to the Communities. Section 2(5) gives a clear commitment that the report of developments to the Communities may be completely different from what it has been to date. This change, which is an improvement on our Bill, requires a report twice a year. When we are deciding where the discretionary factor appropriately lies we should do so in relation to forthcoming legislation. However, I do not think it can be achieved in this legislation.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I will try to deal with some of the main points on the constitutional issue. On behalf of the Government I will reflect on all the points made. I accept that this is just the beginning, as Deputy O'Keeffe said.The Constitution allocates certain functions to the Oireachtas and certain functions to the Government as the Executive. We cannot change these functions by legislation. However, it is important to establish an effective dialogue between the Government and the Oireachtas on  the broad range of EU business. The Bill before us provides a legislative basis for that dialogue.Deputy O'Keeffe's amendments Nos. 6 and 7 appear to oblige a Minister to make a report, even in exceptional circumstances where, because of the confidentiality of the issue, he or she would not be in a position to provide the information. As the debate has proceeded the Deputy has acknowledged the Government's position in this regard. To add to what the Deputy said, the provision is necessary in view of the wide remit of the Act. If we take on the confidentiality provision there may be issues in relation to terrorist organisations. An example of this would be in the Common Foreign and Security Policy which includes a proposal to impose sanctions such as those in force against the regime of the former Yugoslav President Milosevic. In such cases the proposal normally includes details of proposed targets for sanctions. The publication of this information in advance could jeopardise the successful implementation of the sanctions and information on any such measure would be brought to the attention of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.I accept the spirit of the debate. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who dealt adequately with these issues during the previous Stage, I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions. I am sorry we did not have more time to discuss these issues. I thank those who contributed to all Stages of the Bill and I hope we can proceed from here.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	560	Before the adjournment of this debate, I was giving a chronology of events leading to the appointment by the Taoiseach of Mr. Raphael Burke to his Cabinet. I was indicating that on 24 June 1997 Deputy Dermot Ahern reported to the Taoiseach that JMSE was denying making a payment to Mr. Burke. Why would a company, being asked in confidence by a senior member of the party it supported, deny making a political donation to another senior member of that party if that donation was above board and satisfactory? However, by 27 June, the Taoiseach was able to tell the Tánaiste that the payment JMSE claimed had not been made had actually been made. How was he in a position to do so? We do not know.In the Dáil on 28 May the Taoiseach sought to suggest, among other things, that he was not  aware of the donation from JMSE to Mr. Burke until Mr. Burke's statement in the Dáil about the affair. What we do know is that he certainly did not ask Mr. Burke himself, or if he did, he denied doing so in this House when asked that particular question by Deputy Quinn on 28 May 1998.The Taoiseach has since sought to suggest that he did not mean what he said on that fateful day, 28 May 1998, but his colleague Deputy Dermot Ahern thought he knew the line to follow. He thought the line the Taoiseach presented originally was the one he was supposed to defend. In defence of the position he thought the Taoiseach was then adopting, which was that the Taoiseach was ignorant of the JMSE payment, as related by the Taoiseach to this House, Deputy Dermot Ahern told the Dáil that the Taoiseach was in no position to know about the Burke payment.In fairness to Deputy Dermot Ahern, it is very difficult to slavishly follow one's master when one does not know where he has been or where he is going. However, if Deputy Dermot Ahern was not confused at that stage, he must surely have got a shock when the Tánaiste, a year later, informed the Flood tribunal that she had been informed by the Taoiseach of the payment to Mr. Burke prior to Mr. Burke's appointment on 27 June and that she thought the payment was okay. True to form, Deputy Dermot Ahern does not seem to be unduly troubled by this particular chain of events, or if he was, he certainly did not indicate this to the rest of us.Deputy Dermot Ahern was not the only one to look the other way when these clear contradictions of the official line became apparent. Despite her evidence to the Flood tribunal, the Tánaiste was not unduly bothered when the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 28 May 1998 that: "On the day I appointed the then Deputy Burke as Minister I was working on the understanding that no money had been given to him". Did he or did he not know? Deputy Dermot Ahern's aforementioned restating of the position in the Dáil on 3 June does not seem to have impacted on his conscience too much either.Perhaps the Tánaiste's conscience was troubling her anyway. Her recent statement that she accepted the Taoiseach's assurances on the Burke appointment does not represent her finest hour in Irish politics. The reality is that her knowledge of the existence and seriousness of the allegations against Mr. Burke was considerable. I have already informed the House in my earlier contribution that she had been informed of the payment to Mr. Burke from JMSE by her own source within JMSE. She seems not to have winced when told by the Taoiseach that the Minister for Foreign Affairs designate had received £30,000, an enormous sum at the time, from a building company despite ongoing and serious speculation about corruption in her own local authority area. It seems not to have bothered her in the slightest.More importantly, she told the Flood tribunal that she raised the matter with the Taoiseach and that she continued to discuss it with him until the  morning of 27 June, the day that Raphael Burke was appointed to the Cabinet. Why is this important? It is important because on 24 June, three days before the appointment, Deputy Dermot Ahern told the Taoiseach that the donation had not been made. Did the Taoiseach tell this to the Tánaiste? If not, why not? If so, why did the Tánaiste not appreciate the significance of a payment claimed to have been received but the making of which was denied? If she did not know on 27 June, why did she not bring the whole house down when she became aware of the Taoiseach's deception in this matter?The Tánaiste certainly received additional information about the alleged JMSE payment in the immediate aftermath of her connivance in the formation of that Government. She was informed of Mr. Gogarty's allegations by her party colleague, then Mr. McDowell, now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and by Mr. Gogarty himself by letter in July 1997. However, having presided over a disastrous election campaign, the Tánaiste did not feel able to rise above the action and colluded further in the exclusion of Raphael Burke's name from the original terms of reference of the Flood tribunal that came before this House.It was nearly a year later, when the Tánaiste was dealing with the Taoiseach's evasiveness on another matter – the Rennicks payment to Mr. Burke – that Mr. Justice Flood was finally asked to investigate the payment to Mr. Raphael Burke. We now know that in the new PD speak none of this matters.The party president, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has said that his party would not pull the Government down because of what happened in 1997. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is operating on a new Pol Pot basis, a new year zero policy. Year zero started when he was appointed to the Cabinet as Attorney General. His intent is clear – he will not be responsible for what his hapless party leader did before his return to office. The Progressive Democrats were bought and they will stay bought. In a classic example of biting the hand that feeds it, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform now blames it all on the media: it is all the media's fault anyway.To say that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have to provide answers to this House about the Burke appointment is, in a way, a futile demand. I recognise that fact. The time for proper accountability is long since passed. While this House still has an obligation to pursue the truth, the solemn responsibility of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers to be answerable to the House on this matter has long since been abandoned. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have let down their parties and the electorate that put them into high office and they should depart the political stage.Irish politics will recover from the seediness that has infected it throughout the Haughey era. I believe it is already doing so. The tribunals, dragged by the Opposition from a reluctant Taoiseach, represent an important starting point. We resent the constant claims by the Taoiseach that he is responsible for the establishment of the Flood tribunal. It took us a year to have Raphael Burke included in the terms of reference because of the hostility, even to an investigation, by the parties in government.Legislation insisted on by the Labour Party and implemented by me as Minister for the Environment and by my party colleague, Eithne FitzGerald, provides a legal framework for accountable public administration in this country. It was fought tooth and nail by the parties in government. The Electoral Bill I introduced was fought by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for months on end on Committee Stage. He took the view it was a bad Bill that needed to be resisted. To borrow a phrase, we have much more to do.The problems within Fianna Fáil go far wider than the Taoiseach and Mr. Raphael Burke. Since the publication of the interim Flood tribunal report, the Fianna Fáil spin has been to the effect that Ray Burke was a once-off rogue and that as far as the party is concerned the problem was addressed when Mr. Burke resigned from the Dáil. Unfortunately, there is much evidence to suggest that the political culture that created Ray Burke, revealed in such stark detail in the interim Flood tribunal report, still infects much of the Fianna Fáil organisation.It is an informative exercise to consider the list of people indicated in the report as having obstructed, hindered or failed to co-operate with the tribunal. Apart from Mr. P. J. Mara, the man to whom the Taoiseach entrusted his political fate in the last two general elections, the list includes several who have featured regularly in the Fianna Fáil hospitality tent at the Galway races. The list also includes those who were seen to be visibly and actively involved in the recent Fianna Fáil general election campaign. It is at least probable that some of those who contributed so generously to Mr. Burke have continued to provide financial support to the Fianna Fáil Party.The Taoiseach has promised that in his reply to this debate tomorrow he will answer all questions put by the Opposition. I have a simple and direct question to put to him and I look forward to a simple and direct reply. How many of those listed in the report as having obstructed, hindered or failed to co-operate with the tribunal of inquiry were, or are, members of the Fianna Fáil Party? How many, if any, of those on the list have made financial contributions to Fianna Fáil since the Flood tribunal was established?What has been revealed by the Flood tribunal about the organic relationship between one of the most senior Fianna Fáil politicians and business interests also puts into context the huge determination and effort by the Taoiseach in defending  corporate donations last year in the face of Labour Party efforts to end the practice by way of a Private Members' Bill. There is much more I would like to say but I will conclude by pointing out that the actions of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the appointment and rehabilitation of Raphael Burke will almost certainly, in the eyes of the people, have the most serious consequences for them and their political future.

Is he still convinced of this? Five years ago, the Taoiseach said that Raphael Burke was a proud and honourable man and that he was loyal, true, persevering, principled, caring and committed. Does he still hold that view?The thrust of my party's amendment is to undo the damage done. The Government's motion notes the findings, condemns the actions and commends the work of Mr. Justice Flood and expresses its support for the tribunal. However, it does nothing to undo the damage inflicted on the people from what happened and which is being investigated by the Flood tribunal.It is not only planning decisions that must be considered. Ray Burke was Minister for the Environment, Energy, Communications, Industry and Commerce, Justice and Foreign Affairs. He was also a Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and a county councillor. If he was a virus he had the potential  to infect the entire body politic. Bug Burke and its consequences continue to this day.Has Fianna Fáil changed its view on ethics over the years? Would the party accept contributions from Ansbacher account holders? Will the Taoiseach or his representatives express a view on this? The consequences of the actions of Ray Burke and his colleagues continue to this day. Families are left without shops, parks and playgrounds which are within walking distance of anonymous new housing estates. Communities are left without local shops or services and workers are left without a decent public transport system and are stuck in lines of traffic to and from work. This still happens. In the village of Delvin, County Westmeath, local councillors, including a Member of this House, Fianna Fáil Deputy Cassidy, are defending their decision to rezone land outside the village. Perhaps as a Fianna Fáil councillor Deputy Cassidy has a monopoly of wisdom in opposing the views of the professional planners working for Westmeath County Council, but I doubt it.In 1993, the Irish Planning Institute condemned the rezoning in County Dublin as outrageous. It stated that a cursory glance showed how inappropriate and indefensible were many of them. It has not gone away. The then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, called rezoning a debased currency but he did nothing to remedy matters.The Green Party is calling for action on two fronts. We need to review and undo the bad decisions that were made over the course of Ray Burke's political career and we need to rectify the damage from hideous rezoning decisions. We call for a new national planning body, which would review the county and future development plans to ensure that they provide for the proper planning and sustainable development of each county. It would not allow county councillors at a whim to rezone large chunks of land within their area and it would ensure the implementation of the forthcoming national spatial strategy, promised before the end of last year and which is still awaited. It would only intervene in local zoning and rezoning where it can be clearly shown to be unsustainable with reference to Government policy, as contained in the document, Sustainable Development, a Strategy for Ireland, and other thinking in this area. This new body would contain the reckless antics of some county councillors, whose inappropriate decisions continue to this day.With regard to the questionable rezoning incorporated into development plans, we believe that the plans should be correlated to local elections so that when these occur, the electorate would be given the chance to vote for councillors or candidates on the basis of zoning or rezoning in development plans they proposed and voted for at their county council. The electorate would then have a clear record of who they vote for. This would assist democracy at all levels.Who knows on what basis the former Minister, Mr. Burke, made decisions. They must be investi gated and reviewed by the Government. I have referred to planning and rezoning matters but there is also a need to look at licences awarded and decisions on gas fields in the west, telecommunications and planning. Each Department must undertake this review and the results should be presented to this House for debate.If the Taoiseach has the courage of his convictions – I hope there will be convictions – he should undo any decisions seen to have been made for the wrong reasons at any stage over the last quarter of a century of Ray Burke's political career. It is an appalling vista but the political process and the people will continue to suffer unless justice is done and is seen to be done. I am proposing the amendment that Dáil Éireann set up a new planning body to ensure that all development plans are compatible with the sustainable development of the area and that the Government would investigate and review all significant decisions made by former Minister, Ray Burke, in his periods as an office holder of many ministries and relating to his work as a county councillor.

Its clarity and straight-talking approach has struck a chord with the people who have bought copies of the report in unprecedented numbers. The report confirms that former Minister, Ray Burke, enriched himself with the help of property speculators and developers who themselves benefited hugely from the corrupt planning system. While these people ripped off the ordinary citizen in the 1980s our country was experiencing record levels of unemployment and emigration which had returned to the levels of the 1950s and Government cutbacks were devastating our health and education systems. The report answers many questions but it raises many more. That is why we have tabled the amendment in the name of the five Sinn Féin Deputies which I wish to formally move.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his clarification. The amendment we would have moved calls for the oil and gas exploration licences negotiated and granted by former Minister for Energy and Communications, Ray Burke, to be fully investigated by the tribunal.I first raised the great gas and oil rip-off here in the Dáil four years ago, in October 1998. It received little attention but I believe it is as scandalous as anything in the interim report, a report which vindicates our challenge. Sinn Féin is proposing this amendment as we believe that the circumstances surrounding the changes made  to the terms and conditions governing the granting of oil and gas exploration licences by Ray Burke in September 1987 demand the very same scrutiny as that which has been given to his role in planning and other irregularities.Ray Burke sold off our natural resources to the multinationals at a knockdown price unprecedented anywhere in the world. This island is surrounded by vast mineral wealth, which if properly utilised could immeasurably improve the economic and social conditions of all our people. Successive Governments have instead chosen to surrender control to unscrupulous and deceitful companies who are sitting on these reserves practically rent free while they make little attempt to exploit them.It is our contention that the most serious and dubious of the concessions made were those introduced in September 1987 by former Minister, Ray Burke. The changes made in the terms and conditions governing the granting of exploration licences abolished the State's 50% stake in any discovery, got rid of royalties and allowed the companies to write off most of their earnings against tax. In other words, the potential benefits for the Irish economy and the Irish people were given away.The changes were made by Ray Burke against the strong advice of a senior official in the Department of Energy and Communications, and following a series of private meetings between the Minister and company executives. Given what we now know of the nature of the deals which Ray Burke made with various property developers, we would strongly urge that the precise nature of the deals done with the multinational oil and gas companies be investigated by the tribunal.In replying to questions in the Dáil on the changes, Ray Burke admitted that some of the oil companies had been given advance notice of the proposals but there had been no prior negotiations with them in regard to what they wanted to be included. That sounds highly implausible, especially given that when later questioned, he refused to give the Dáil any details of the results of drills because of the confidentiality clauses in the licences granted. In other words, the elected representatives of the people of this State were denied all knowledge of what was being done.The reasons given at the time to justify the concessions were that they would provide a massive boost to the drilling for oil and gas. That did not happen. Instead the companies snapped up the licences and have, by and large, been content to sit on them for the past 15 years. While Ray Burke claimed in the Dáil that he hoped to see up to 30 new wells drilled in the year following the changes, there were in fact only three. Indeed, the overall level of activity declined after 1987. While the companies invested almost £400 million in the ten years prior to the changes, this fell to £170 million over the following decade. Of that sum, a mere 4% was spent in this State.It is high time, therefore, that the subterfuge and secrecy surrounding the deals are made sub ject to the same examination as all of the other shady aspects of the former Minister's career. It is time also that the people of this State were given some insight into the manner in which their natural resources were shamefully surrendered. The ongoing relationship between the oil companies and Fianna Fáil must also examined. One of the main beneficiaries of the changes, Marathon International Petroleum Ireland Limited, has contributed to Fianna Fáil funds. Another company, Enterprise Oil plc, is one of the main stakeholders in the Corrib field, and has hosted Fianna Fáil's fund-raising event at the Galway Races, as referred to by earlier speakers.The Marathon Oil Corporation, the parent company of Marathon International Petroleum Ireland Limited, spent $4 million in political lobbying in the United States in 1997. It has also been the subject of federal litigation over its failure to pay the correct royalties by not reporting finds, something which may not be unique to its US activities. Is it not a happy coincidence that Marathon's Irish subsidiary is based in the Cayman Islands?That the legacy of Ray Burke is well and truly alive was proven by last year's sale of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited for a pittance. Tosco Oil Corporation, the company which bought INPC has an appalling record. It has been found guilty in the United States of safety breaches which have led to the deaths of several refinery workers. It has had decrees issued against it by the Environmental Protection Agency and it operated under the brutal regime in Indonesia. I urge the Government to accept the terms of this amendment. It is an imperative that that be done.The interim report highlights the need for a more thorough forensic examination of Ray Burke's entire career. In particular, the report contains serious allegations not just about the granting of the Century Radio licence but that a shopping list of prices for all the radio and TV licences was on offer. We need to investigate if the granting of the other 20 licences was carried out in a proper and fair manner.The Flood tribunal is dealing with one county council. Are we really to believe that Dublin County Council was the only council in the 26 counties where planning corruption was going on?Just as the Moriarty tribunal has decided to widen the scope of its inquiries to cover the granting of the second mobile phone licence to ESAT Digifone, there is a need to widen the scope of the Flood tribunal. I ask the Tánaiste who is representing the Government here this evening to take note of that appeal and to recommend the acceptance and adoption of the proposals contained in the amendment put forward by myself and my colleagues.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	567	Mr. Justice Flood and his legal team are to be congratulated for  their outstanding efforts on our behalf. Their second interim report is an excellent document. It is clear, concise and forthright and is written in plain and understandable language. It is an eminently readable document which draws clear and unambiguous conclusions and pulls no punches. The House and the country owe a great deal of gratitude to the honourable judge and his team. They have done a great act of public service to the State. Their work to date has fully justified the decision of the House to establish the tribunal in the first place. There have been tribunals before which have disappointed the great hopes placed in them. This one certainly has not done so.It is to the credit of Mr. Justice Flood and his team that they persevered with their work and persisted with their inquiries and efforts. Few tribunals of inquiry have had to contend with such sniping hostility as this one. Almost from the outset there were clear and determined attempts to undermine the tribunal, discredit it, cast aspersions on its efficiency and effectiveness, and query the rationale for its continued existence. Powerful, wealthy and influential people wanted to bring it down at the earliest opportunity. They sought to bring the tribunal into public disrepute and they would have been happy to see it abandoned. Despite this, the tribunal got on with its painstaking work. It saw off a series of legal challenges, overcame many obstacles and allowed nothing to deflect it in its search for the truth.The Flood tribunal has helped to restore public confidence in the concept of a tribunal of inquiry. It has delivered results and has not been a waste of taxpayers' money as the cynics have suggested – quite the opposite. The work of the tribunal has generated money for the Exchequer in terms of tax liabilities uncovered. That said, tribunals do not operate to some crude profit and loss account. They stand or fall on their ability to uncover the truth. By this standard the inquiry has been an outstanding success.A little more than five years ago the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil received a mandate from the people to form a coalition Government. Discussions commenced between both parties about the formation of a new Administration in terms of its policies and personnel. The leader of the Fianna Fáil party, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, signalled to me his intention to appoint Ray Burke to the new Cabinet. I was aware of various allegations which had been made against Mr. Burke and I sought information and assurance on these from the Taoiseach.My specific concerns related to payments which Mr. Burke was alleged to have received. I wanted to know what moneys he had received and whether he had done anything improper in return for them. The Taoiseach told me that he had investigated the matter fully. He told me that Ray Burke had received £30,000 from Mr. James Gogarty/JMSE, that he had retained £20,000 for  his election campaign in Dublin North and had forwarded £10,000 to Fianna Fáil headquarters.I had two choices as leader of the Progressive Democrats: either to accept the assurances given to me by the Taoiseach and agree to the appointment of Ray Burke as a Minister, or to refuse to accept the assurances given to me and to refuse to accept the appointment of Mr. Burke as Minister. I accepted the former option because I wanted to base the new Government on a foundation of trust, co-operation and partnership. In a previous coalition with Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats had been branded, fairly or unfairly, as a party that was unreasonable and too quick in forcing resignations and blocking appointments. I was determined to show that the Progressive Democrats could work successfully in a coalition Government. I recognised from the outset that the issue of trust between the party leaders was central to the success of any coalition. That is why I was willing to take the Taoiseach on trust and to accept in good faith his assurances regarding Mr. Ray Burke.As the weeks went by, the allegations against Mr. Burke persisted and it became apparent that he could not continue in Government. He resigned both his ministry and his membership of the House. It was also apparent that we needed to get to the truth regarding planning in Dublin, and it was in that context that the Flood tribunal was established by a resolution of the House on the initiative of the Government.I have said before that one of the true tests of a mature democracy is the ability to expose and confront corruption wherever it arises. Ireland is showing its ability to pass that test. As politicians representing the people, we in the House have established tribunals and inquiries under the Companies Act and we have undertaken investigations through the committees of the Oireachtas.The Flood and Moriarty tribunals will continue their work. They in turn may spawn other inquiries as the McCracken tribunal did the Moriarty tribunal. There will be more evidence, discoveries, revelations and reports. We will learn more about how things were done in this country through the 1980s and 1990s. We are likely to see more light shed on that shady interface between Government and business where public decisions had the capacity to deliver private wealth for the fortunate few.All this can be shocking, fascinating and even entertaining for the watching public, but it will be largely pointless unless we are prepared to learn lessons from what is uncovered and take the necessary action to prevent such things from happening again. That is why we have taken such strong and determined action over the past five years to fight corruption and to ensure that everybody in this country plays by the same rules regardless of who they are. We have established the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ensure that our company laws are prop erly policed and to prevent the abuse of the privilege of limited liability. We have given extensive and wide-ranging powers to the Revenue Commissioners to combat tax evasion. We have brought in tight new regulations to govern donations to political parties and to individual politicians. Most importantly perhaps, we have sought to create a new culture and climate for the relationship between business and Government.The work of the McCracken, Moriarty and Flood tribunals shows that we now have the will and the way to uncover corrupt activity. People engaging in such activity now do so in the firm knowledge that they are likely to have their actions investigated with great thoroughness by a tribunal of inquiry and that, as a result, they will have to face the full rigours of the law.For more than ten years tribunals of inquiry have been almost a permanent feature of our political landscape. It may be bad that they are necessary but surely it is good that we recognise that they are necessary and are prepared to establish them. In the war against corruption the tribunal of inquiry has become the nuclear deterrent, the ultimate signal of the State's willingness to vindicate the rights of all citizens by exposing wrongdoing wherever it arises.Corrupt societies are not prosperous societies. If we want to continue to attract job-creating investment we must demonstrate clearly that this is a country in which business is done fairly, openly and above board. We must also demonstrate that the rule of law applies to everyone regardless of who they are. We must demonstrate that there are no golden circles, cosy cartels or inside tracks. We must be resolute in our determination to root out corruption at every level. If we fail to do so, our reputation and our country will suffer.The publication of this interim report shows that the Flood tribunal is doing an excellent job on behalf of the people. I commend Mr. Justice Flood and his legal team for their sterling efforts and I wish them well in the work that lies ahead.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	568	This debate is not good enough. It is ineffective and will not do justice to the detail and clarity of the Flood tribunal interim report. By structuring the debate in the present format, the Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government are once again refusing to answer direct questions on the contents of the report. I thought that the Progressive Democrats, the so-called watchdogs of Fianna Fáil, would insist that the Taoiseach come into the Chamber and reply to direct questions with straight answers.My party and the people demand to know what the Taoiseach knew of Ray Burke's affairs before he appointed him to the Cabinet in 1997 and what influenced him in making that decision and other related decisions over a period. The Taoiseach's assertion that he dealt satisfactorily with the Burke controversy is not correct. The Dáil established the Flood tribunal and the Taoiseach owes  it to the Dáil and the people to make an honest attempt to clear up the issues raised in this corrupt affair. Today represents yet another page in a sordid chapter of Irish politics. A Fianna Fáil Minister who served in several Fianna Fáil Governments has been found by a tribunal of inquiry to have received corrupt payments. There have also been conclusions of obstruction and of failure to co-operate with the tribunal about friends of Fianna Fáil. These charges are very serious. We have seen a glimpse of the golden circle that exists in Irish political and business life, a circle that has been for so long dismissed as myth, innuendo or mere speculation. This golden circle now stands exposed for all to see.This could have been a good day for truth and transparency if the Government had faced openly their responsibilities. Unfortunately, it can only be seen as a very bad day for Fianna Fáil, as we see that party, led by Taoiseach Deputy Bertie Ahern, scurrying to pretend nothing serious has happened. This Government shows obvious contempt for the Irish people by treating them as fools.We are now beginning to realise the importance of the delay in failing to appoint extra judges to the Flood tribunal. This delay surely saved the last general election for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Of course, this is not the only instance where Fianna Fáil tried to fool the people. Before the election, it seemed that everything was in order in the country's finances, but after the election the Minister for Finance, known as Champagne Charlie, decided to release the real economic information to the people.For a moment, let us consider the circumstances under which Ray Burke was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Taoiseach. In 1997, at the time of the appointment, there was widespread concern in media and political circles. The Taoiseach could not have missed these warning signs. However, he went against the warnings of his predecessor, former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, in appointing Ray Burke to the Cabinet and he also went against the warnings of the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, in making that appointment. All these danger signs, when put together, should have triggered political alarm bells in any politician's mind. However, apparently in the mind of the leader of Fianna Fáil everything was all right. Somehow, I doubt this very much.Many people see the Taoiseach as one of the most politically astute and gifted political survivors in the country, but incredibly this astute politician appointed Ray Burke to the third highest office in the land. The people are asking what does Ray Burke know about the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern?The Taoiseach asserted that he "Looked up every tree in north Dublin" seeking information on Ray Burke. It is convenient that he failed to look up the one tree that he knew would have given him definite answers, where before there  was only rumour and speculation. This appalling lack of judgment and lack of action is damning.Some current Fianna Fáil Deputies, including the Taoiseach and three current Ministers, were around the Cabinet table when Ray Burke decided to award a national radio licence and then subsequently divert money from RTE and give it to Century Radio. This was against the advice of the Civil Service, was opposed to the findings of an independent study and showed no regard to the protestations of Ray Burke's predecessor, former Deputy Jim Mitchell. If RTE did not perform to its usual public service standards in subsequent years, we now understand where some if not all of the blame must go.There was also the question of the award of Irish passports, approved by a Fianna Fáil Cabinet. Was all of the agreed investment made or is this just another question that Fianna Fáil is desperately trying not to answer in case there is further damage done to its party's reputation?The scope of mysterious Fianna Fáil Ministers' decisions does not begin or end with Ray Burke. In 1994, on Fianna Fáil's last day in office, a consortium was given a special tax designation on a green field site for an urban renewal programme, Golden Island, in Athlone Town which greatly enhanced the profitability of that site. Unhappily close ties can be established between Fianna Fáil and the beneficiaries.Another example of Fianna Fáil's contempt for the intelligence of the Irish people was the Fianna Fáil legislation which made Ken Rohan the sole beneficiary of a section of the Finance Act, 1994 which retrospectively saved that man from a tax bill from the previous 12 years of £1.5 million. The provisions of that legislation meant only one person would benefit from it and the technicalities of the legislation are so specific as to warrant a demand of credible answers to an incredible situation.Undoubtedly, there is a golden circle in this country, a circle that keeps the rich close to the centres of power and allows them to unduly influence the way in which Government business is done. Unfortunately this culture of big business helping out politicians if they decide certain courses of action is only beginning to come to light. The nod and wink approach that has served the Fianna Fáil Party so well must end here and now.There are questions raised by Mr. Justice Flood's report about the way in which two key members of Fianna Fáil have behaved. Ray Burke was found out to have taken corrupt payments and P. J. Mara, a less well-known figure, stands accused of not co-operating with a tribunal of inquiry. Leaving that aside, I would bet my last cent that Fianna Fáil has consulted with Mr. Mara about how to handle the Flood report, even after his "just for show" resignation from the Nice campaign. After all, the Taoiseach did not ask him to leave.Fianna Fáil, which so masterfully out-manoeuvred Opposition parties and the elect orate with talk of continuing good days under Fianna Fáil, was putting plans in place to almost immediately freeze spending once the election was over. These spin doctors who have been active in the past are now working overtime to put Mr. Justice Flood's report in the stale news section of the newspapers. It will be interesting to watch the tactics Fianna Fáil members employ now when desperately trying not to investigate any of Ray Burke's ministerial decisions. They will attempt to discredit the people asking the questions and will dodge the questions by answering completely different questions. They will attempt to deflect the burning issue of the day onto something completely different. Essentially, Fianna Fáil will just refuse to answer questions just like the Taoiseach is doing today and will do tomorrow.At this stage, I wish to acknowledge the statement made by Fiona O'Malley of the Progressive Democrats on the principle that the Taoiseach is not facing up to his responsibilities in not answering questions here today. It is unfortunate that she is not supported by the Ministers, Deputies Harney and McDowell, of the same party.There was once a Dublin politician who loved to talk to journalists and wanted his picture in the newspapers everyday. In recent times, he does not like talking to journalists and often refuses point blank to answer legitimate questions on the whole fallout from the Flood tribunal. That man likes to have a small controlled media group around himself everywhere he goes. I refer to the newly appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and former PD idealist, Deputy Michael McDowell. What has happened to Deputy McDowell? He knows how important this tribunal is to the nation. He used to be highly idealistic in his stance on many issues. Sometimes I disagreed with him, but I did respect him. His assault on the media only proves to me how far down the Fianna Fáil path the Progressive Democrats have gone. Where is his condemnation of a Taoiseach who appointed a very suspect Minister for Foreign Affairs and, to this day, refuses to answer all questions on the matter? I would expect a Fianna Fáil Minister to unquestionably defend a Taoiseach like ours, but not the Minister, Deputy McDowell. Have the lines between the Ministers, Deputies McCreevy and Harney, McDowell and O'Donoghue, been blurred by this desire for power? The people elected the Progressive Democrats as their representatives to keep Fianna Fáil from an overall majority and they are now betraying their mandate.Mr. Justice Flood, on being appointed, was entrusted with finding the truth but all he got were lies, attempted manipulations and the determined undermining of his task. Thankfully, he has cut through the lies and given us the truth. Now it is our job, the job of Members, to take up the case in search of the truth and to separate fact from fiction and attempted cover-ups.The Taoiseach should take responsibility for appointing a person like Ray Burke. A Cabinet should accept collective responsibility for having a person like Ray Burke behave in the way he did in awarding a licence to Century Radio. Fianna Fáil should take responsibility for spawning two leaders with serious question marks over them. One received millions of pounds in personal payments and the other signed blank cheques for the first one. The latter also ignored the warning signs and appointed a corrupt politician to one of the highest offices in the land. Now he will not answer any questions.The failure and refusal of Fianna Fáil to investigate all of Ray Burke's ministerial decisions is obviously good for the party but it is bad for the people of Ireland, who feel betrayed by the Taoiseach's faith in Ray Burke. To pour more salt into the wounds already inflicted by Ray Burke on the body politic, the Taoiseach castigated the media and Opposition for, "hounding a decent and honourable man out of politics."  I find it hard to believe that Dessie O'Malley would have stayed on that side of the House as leader of the Progressive Democrats and listened to this story unfold and to the Taoiseach's defence of Ray Burke, but then, Deputy Harney is no Des O'Malley.Let us remember it is the people that count and they are beginning to see the damage that planning decisions have done to their homes and neighbourhoods, to their counties and to their quality of life. The people see how the culture of greed has badly affected many important decisions resulting in a poor standard of living for Irish people. In light of what Mr. Justice Flood has concluded, and the political situation in which we find ourselves, we have a legislative and moral duty to the people of Ireland. All relevant Ministers must conduct a review of all decisions promoted by Ray Burke in their portfolios. They must give a comprehensive documented account of the order of events in Ray Burke's career and report back to the Dáil with the facts from each Department within a short time. The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil welcomed the Flood report. Let us see them act on it and prove they are not hypocrites.We in Fine Gael believe the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must set up an independent land use commission chaired by a High Court judge. We advocated this earlier this year, long before the interim tribunal report was published, and now we demand that it is set up. The commission would have the power to examine all land rezoning decisions made by local authorities to ensure decisions were made in line with local development plans and complied with guidelines pertaining to sustainability and good planning practice. The commission will not undermine the role of local councillors but will be supportive of them by examining and certifying their decisions.I cannot understand the position of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government  in relation to this proposal. I saw him on television recently suggesting that since the Flood tribunal did not have any recommendations in relation to planning in its interim report, no decisions would be made by the Minister until such time as the final report was published. We know enough now to start taking action.Instead of criticising the Fine Gael land use commission proposal, the Minister should immediately set about preparing legislation to establish the commission. His opposition to this proposal is based on the grounds that the commission would undermine the role of the local councillor. I am adamant that it will be totally supportive of correct decisions and will certify those decisions in an independent way. The recent case of rezoning in Delvin, County Westmeath, which has been referred to already, is one that would warrant investigation by a land use commission. Local councillors overruled the advice of planners to approve massive housing developments in Delvin by rezoning 60 acres on the outskirts of the village. Delvin's population will be ten times its current level when the development is completed, increasing from 358 inhabitants to more than 4,000. The county manager opposed the development on the grounds that planning permission already granted would provide for an increase in population to 600 people and that 163 acres which were already zoned as residential could accommodate an extra 1,400 people. As has been said already, Deputy Cassidy counterclaimed that the land zoned as residential was not available for development and he dismissed county council plans for the development of the village as complete and utter failures, alluding to the 11% decline in the population of the village at a time when the rest of Westmeath was booming. There is a strong prima facie case here for independent assessment of the decision by Westmeath County Council.The Flood tribunal has confirmed the general public's suspicions of the planning process. If our political system is genuinely turning over a new leaf, it is unsatisfactory to leave radical rezoning decisions of this nature with elected local representatives alone. Surely it is in everyone's interests, including proprietors and decision makers in the planning process in Westmeath, that the propriety of this decision be assessed by a land use commission. We in Fine Gael also expect the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a permanent anti-corruption office; Deputy Deasy will deal with this.In light of what has happened, I expect Fianna Fáil to eventually ask the Taoiseach to consider his position sooner rather than later in an attempt to distance themselves from the sleaze. The Progressive Democrats need to decide whether they begin merging with Fianna Fáil or cross the floor of this House before their new backbenchers are permanently tarnished by sitting beside Fianna Fáil. As for Independent Deputies who may be thinking of supporting Fianna Fáil, they are tempting the electorate to vote them out without  their political and personal dignity intact at the next general election.

I also welcome the opportunity to address some of the spurious political smoke which has been contrived by Opposition Members in the aftermath of the report's publication – in particular the concerted effort which has been made by some members of Fine Gael, the newly established Green-Féin Alliance and the third opposition party, the Labour Party, to suggest that the Taoiseach has questions to answer arising out of the publication of the second interim Flood report.Every person who has read this report is aware of one unassailable and uncontradictable fact. There is not a single syllable of criticism of the Taoiseach contained in the report. It is clear that this is a source of great disappointment to the Opposition. It serves neither democracy nor the tribunal for public attention to be diverted from those who are the subject of damning criticism in this report on to people who are not. I invite the three opposition groupings to focus in this debate on what has been found – not on what they wish had been found.Mr. Justice Flood has made findings of corrupt and criminal activity. That activity is disgraceful and deserves to be condemned by every Member. Without reservation I accept the findings of Mr. Justice Flood and I commend the work he and his legal team have done. I wish them continued success in their future work. Much remains to be done on many fronts.It is appropriate for the House to pause and acknowledge the work which has been done to date by Mr. Justice Flood. It is also appropriate that, as Members, we condemn those whom he has found to have behaved in a corrupt and unlawful fashion. It is deeply disturbing that a former Member has been found to have lied to the Dáil and to the tribunal established by the Oireachtas. It is equally disturbing that the same former Member has been found to have accepted corrupt payments and to have behaved in a corrupt and unlawful manner. Our duty is to ensure the fullest investigation possible continues not alone in the tribunal but also among the other State agencies responsible for the detection and prosecution of such conduct.We do well to remember that what is said in this House and by Members and what is reported  in the media in relation to tribunals of inquiry and persons whose actions are subject to scrutiny by tribunals of inquiry can and has had legal consequences elsewhere. It is incumbent on every Member to ensure our utterances in this debate do not improperly impinge on the constitutional rights of others, including the right of the people to have serious criminal wrongdoing brought to trial and determined by the body which the Constitution entrusts with responsibility for determining such issues, namely a jury.Many Members of the Opposition now feign to have had knowledge in 1997 of the matters which were uncovered by the Flood tribunal. I am more than sceptical of those who now make such claims but who for some inexplicable reason behaved as a commune of Trappists at the time of Mr. Burke's appointment. Why did they not speak out? Why did they not use the opportunity of the debate on the appointment of the Cabinet to give voice to the knowledge which they now claim? Why did they not avail of their constitutional immunity from legal suit to give voice to the knowledge they now claim from within this Chamber? Why, if overcome by diffidence or reticence or inexplicable shyness, did they not write or go privately to the Taoiseach to share with him the knowledge they now claim to have had? There was ample precedent for such action – Mr. Cosgrave, as Leader of Fine Gael, communicated with Jack Lynch as Taoiseach over suspicions which he had.Many Members of the Opposition now seek to suggest that there was an onus on all politicians who had knowledge of Mr. Gogarty's allegations in 1997 to engage in an independent investigation into their substance. The suggestion which they now seek to advance is that there was an onus to go to him and to make an inquiry. Let us subject that theory to the acid test. The evidence heard by Mr. Justice Flood revealed that in 1996 and 1997 Mr. Gogarty, in addition to making allegations against Mr. Burke, was also making allegations of gross impropriety – allegations utterly without basis or substance – against a senior member of the Fine Gael party. Did that party or any member of that party go to Mr. Gogarty to conduct the type of investigation which they now say the Taoiseach should have? They did not.Members of the Opposition now seek, with the assistance of hindsight, to apply methods and standards of inquiry to the Taoiseach which neither they nor any of their associates applied at the time.Their actions in 1997 and the then actions of the Taoiseach are entirely consistent with the constitutional order which existed in this State then as now. As Mr. Justice Brian Walsh of the Supreme Court stated in 1966 when delivering his judgment in the case of The People v. O'Callaghan [1966] IR, reported at page 513, “The presumption of innocence until conviction is a very real thing and is not simply a procedural rule taking effect only at the trial.”The actions of the Opposition in 1997 indicate clearly that those who now claim to have known, in fact knew nothing. Unsubstantiated rumours which in 1997 were without any presented supporting evidence is as much as was available to the Opposition. They chose neither to contact the Taoiseach about the rumours nor to utilise the parliamentary privilege, conferred on them by reason of their membership of this House, to publicly voice the rumours.I am sure that with hindsight, Deputy Trevor Sargent, leader of the Green Party, would have refrained from making the following remark on the evening of Mr. Burke's appointment to the Cabinet: "I am glad that two Deputies from north Dublin have been nominated as Ministers. I offer good wishes to Deputy Burke on his nomination as Minister for Foreign Affairs."  I am also sure that with hindsight, the then leader of the Labour Party, former Deputy Dick Spring, would not on the same occasion have described Deputy Burke as a "strong-willed and able politician".The debate on the appointment of the Cabinet in 1997 afforded every Member an opportunity to voice such concerns or reservations as they felt were credibly established in their minds. The Official Report records their actions. Opposition Deputies who now seek to present themselves as parliamentary watchdogs, prepared to bark at the merest hint of the shadow of wrongdoing, were as silent as lambs. Their pretence that things were different serves neither them nor democracy well. That, of course, has not prevented Deputy Quinn from joining the fray for one last futile joust before resigning himself to banishment in the bitter pastures of political defeat. Broken-lanced and bedraggled, his pursuit of obscure political windmills remains undimmed. Some political leaders flounder because they cannot see the wood for the trees. That is something which can never be said of Deputy Quinn because he never got that far; as a leader he failed to see the branches for the twigs. Perhaps having brought the once proud Labour Party to the ignominious position of the third largest opposition grouping, behind both Fine Gael and the newly established "Green Féin" alliance, Deputy Quinn will, in the tranquillity of political retirement, finally come to terms with the popularity and electoral success of the Taoiseach. As he ponders his political legacy as the only leader of the Labour Party in the past three decades to have failed to achieve the office of Tánaiste, the only leader of the Labour Party in the past three decades to have failed to lead his party to electoral success and the only leader of the Labour Party to achieve relegation to the third division of Opposition parties, he must reflect ruefully that political history will remember him as the leader who failed where even Michael O'Leary succeeded. To have brought the Labour Party from Spring tide to electoral stagnation in one disastrous decade is a questionable political legacy.For the past fortnight Deputy Quinn has been engrossed in an examination of historic twigs. As  ever he has missed the big picture. He has sought to associate the Taoiseach with a report in which no adverse comment is made of the Taoiseach. The report must have been a disappointing read for Deputy Quinn. At last, he must have thought, the "Get Bertie Campaign" which he has relentlessly pursued throughout his political leadership might yield some fruit, but the detail of the Flood report returned Deputy Quinn to the familiar political terrain of failure. The report did not contain a syllable of criticism of the Taoiseach, so Deputy Quinn went on a media rampage seeking to suggest that the report suggested the Taoiseach had questions to answer. He was wrong again.With leadership like this is it any wonder that a stagnant Labour Party has been relegated to the parliamentary fourth division, out of Government, out of sight of the main Opposition party and now trailing the "Green Féin" alliance in parliamentary importance. Latin scholars would agree – res ipsa
locquitur.The publication of Mr. Justice Flood's report has had many consequences. The most important is the clear identification of past wrongdoing. The next most important is the transmission of the report to various regulatory and investigative authorities. The publication of the report also serves to show that the institutions of the State, including this House, are strong enough to deal with unsavoury aspects of our recent past. That consequence is a genuine service to democracy. We will be rightly judged on how we follow through on the report's findings. That work must continue unhindered.

Cuireann atá sa tuarascáil alltacht orm agus ar pholaiteoirí. Is fíor le rá go raibh caimiléireacht uafásach ar bun agus tá an-dochar déanta aige seo do pholaiteoirí i gcoitinne.Tá iarracht déanta an tuairim a thabhairt go bhfuil polaiteoirí ar fad mar a chéile. Tá sé tábhachtach go ndéarfaí nach mar sin é agus go bhfuil bunáite na bpolaiteoirí ar gach taobh den Teach seo díreach agus ionraic agus go gcaitheann siad a saol ag obair ar mhaithe leis an bpobal.Tá an-scéal a dhéanamh anois faoi na fíricí atá i dtuarascáil Flood ar nós go mba scéal nua iad. Is seafóid é seo mar bhí a fhios ag an bpobal faoi na fíricí ón am go raibh na héisteachtaí ar bun. An rud a chuireann seo i gcuimhne dom ná an fheadóg deireannach i gcluiche peile thar a bheith aontaobhach, nuair atá a fhios ag gach duine an toradh a bhéas ar an gcluiche i bhfad roimh ré.Tá ionsaí a dhéanamh ar an dTaoiseach, ach ceapaim go bhfuil a fhios ag an bhFreasúra nach bhfuil ann ach cath na mbó maol. Is bocht an rud é nuair a bhaintear leas as tuarascáil mar seo le haghaidh cluichí polaitíochta seachas díriú ar an dream go bhfuil sé ráite fúthu go soiléir anois go raibh caimiléireacht ar bun acu.Bíonn mí-fhoighid ar na meáin agus go minic is tábhachtaí an "soundbite" scioptha seachas an próiseas fada a thabharfaidh torthaí agus freagraí iomlána. Tá gach próiseas fiosrúcháin agus dlí mall. Ní mór dó a bheith cuimsitheach. Ba cheart don bhFreasúra anois a bheith ag obair leis an Rialtas i gcur chun cinn an Bhille ar Chaimiléireacht le go mbeidh sé níos éasca breithiúnas cúirte a fháil in aghaidh lucht caimiléireachta. Ba cheart dóibh díriú orthu siúd a rinne rudaí míchearta agus lán-eolas acu seachas a bheith ag díriú ar dhaoine a chuir muinín i bhfocal daoine ar cruthaíodh ina dhiaidh nach raibh siad iontaofa. Is é an rud atá le déanamh anois ná próiseas na mbinse fiosrucháin a thabhairt go ceann scríbe agus gach áis agus achmhainn, agus reachtaíocht más gá, a chur ar fáil do na hinstitiúdaí éagsúla a bheadh i mbun na daoine a thabhairt chun dlí. Caithfimid bheith thar a bheith cúramach nach ndéarfaimíd aon rud anois a dhéanfadh dochar don phróiseas seo. Chonaic muid cheana an bealach gur féidir le caint mhíchúramach cur isteach ar phróiseas den chineál seo. Idir an dá linn, an fhaid is atá an próiseas seo ar bun tá obair thábhachtach eile le déanamh ag an Rialtas. Nach aisteach, an tseachtain go bhfuil an géarchéim polaitiúil is measa a tharla sa Tuaisceart faoi chaibidil, go bhfuilimid ag caint faoi rudaí a tharla os cionn deich mbliana ó shin agus go bhfuil eolas ag an bpobal fúthu le tamall anuas. Tá sé in am ag an Oireachtas diriú ar riachtanais agus ar phráinn agus ní ar rogha na meán.It is absolutely extraordinary to think that in the middle of what I consider to be the worst political crisis which has hit the northern part of this country since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we are discussing events that happened over ten years ago and which have been public knowledge for some considerable time. The institutions in the North are about to collapse.

I do not read speeches verbatim. Dá seasfadh gach Teachta suas agus scriopt a léamh bheadh sé chomh maith againn na scrioptanna a chur isteach go dtí an oifig.We are discussing events which happened over ten years ago and which have been public knowledge for a considerable time. The amazing thing is that the institutions in the North are about to collapse, violence and intimidation persist, lives are being lost and serious allegations are flying in all quarters. We are ignoring all these matters and elevating to a matter of urgency – I am not saying seriousness – a report which has been nearly five years in preparation. What Mr. Justice Flood has given is official confirmation of facts which have already been in the public domain for some considerable time because of the public hearings. We now have a public judgment on those facts. It did not give us any new factual information.  However, listening to the Opposition, one would think we had suddenly discovered a whole new body of evidence and that it had only been published in the last few weeks.What Mr. Justice Flood said made frightening and sorry reading and was a clear indictment of Irish society, including business and politics. I suggest that rather than trying to use this issue to score cheap political points, those of us who are really concerned about politics and who believe in the integrity of the majority of public representatives, should try with steely resolve to pursue whatever course is necessary to fairly and impartially bring these sordid affairs to a finality and to ensure that those involved face the consequences of their actions. It is also important that we are careful in what we say because we have seen in the past how careless statements can prejudice the ability of the independent agencies of the State, which are set up to institute criminal prosecutions and judge on them, to do their work.All of the people mentioned in the report, the people who have clearly been stated to have been involved in corrupt actions, are of no concern to the Opposition. I do not think the Opposition cares about Burke anymore and the business people who have been named. They are of no interest to it because there is no political mileage to be made out of them. The reality is that it believes there is cheap political mileage to be made at the expense of the Taoiseach and that this is more important than rooting out the serious cancer found in Irish society.The Taoiseach made it clear he will answer the questions on Flood tomorrow and I will not presume to do so on his behalf. There are, however, two comments I would like to make. If the Opposition knew what it now claims everyone knew years ago, why did it not demur at Ray Burke's appointment as a Front Bench spokesperson by the present Taoiseach, the then leader of the Opposition, in 1995, two and a half years before his appointment as Minister? It did not demur at his appointment as Minister.On the issue of his appointment as a Front Bench spokesperson, this might point to a very interesting conclusion, namely, that the Opposition does not consider being a Front Bench spokesperson as being a position of trust and importance and that it does not consider it important for someone in that position to have standards. That is the only conclusion to which one can come. When I was in such a position I considered it a position of great trust. It is about time the Opposition explained to us from where it is coming because this did not come out of the blue as all of the Opposition spokespersons were subsequently appointed Ministers or Ministers of State.Is it now politically unacceptable to take a person at his or her word when there is no clear evidence against him or her? Have we reached a stage where people are guilty by accusation and that their friends are guilty by association? A  number of years ago I was involved in the prisoner issue in Britain and it taught me a very fundamental lesson, that is, that there is no short cut to judgment and that anyone who tries to short cut their way to judgment is the begetter of serious miscarriages of justice. The deciding of the verdict before we have the evidence has, in the past, led to great injustices being perpetrated. We rightly condemn the British courts for their convictions of Irish people regarding the Troubles in the North because the begetting of the conviction became much more important than the following of due process. Such a system of hurried justice protects the guilty and condemns the innocent.Surely, therefore, we should all by now, including the media, have learned the lesson that for the wheels of justice to operate, they must grind slowly and without prejudice. Instead of the present frenzy, would it not be better for us to be employed dealing with the real matters of urgency at hand leaving the issues being examined by the tribunals to them and to the legal process? This is the sane course and the only course which will get real results. It was not Dáil debates and ballyragging across the Chamber which gave us the Flood report but a slow, thorough and systematic analysis of what went on, carried out in a proper form.I would not like the impression to be created that I do not treat this issue as one of the gravest seriousness, but to claim it as a matter of grave urgency when the only way to resolve it is by slow process, is absolutely absurd. I forecast that in ten years time when the history of this week is being written, the crisis in Northern Ireland and not this debate will be spoken about.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Dowd. We have heard a lot in the past few weeks and a bit more tonight about how nobody could have known the story surrounding Ray Burke until Mr. Justice Flood issued his report and that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the rest of the last Cabinet had no way of knowing truth from rumour or fact from fiction. We then wonder why my generation is cynical about politics and politicians. It is time to put a bit of perspective on all of this. The first story published, not just whispered, about Ray Burke was in 1974, the same year I was born. This story has taken my whole life time to properly break and we have to ask ourselves why. It is not that it was a once-off newspaper article – it was published again in 1981 and a similar story resurfaced in 1993. The reason this has taken so long to break is that Ray Burke was pampered and protected by a party which did not have the honesty, integrity or moral courage to wash its hands of him – the party which appointed him Minister on eight occasions. We should stop trying to fool ourselves. It does not take a High Court judge nor a tribunal report for any of us to decide what type of people we are or what type of people we want to be associated with. To hide behind the notion  of prejudicing a trial is a total fallacy. Only one Member of this House, to my knowledge, has ever prejudiced a trial and I am sure she has learned her lesson. The Taoiseach and Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister here tonight, are deliberately missing the point. We still care about Ray Burke and his business friends, or at least their actions. We are not here tonight to question Ray Burke who, thankfully, is not a Member of this House anymore. He did not cease to be a Member because he was removed from office by the Taoiseach, but because he eventually decided to go himself. If, as the Taoiseach said on a previous occasion, the Opposition hounded him out, then it was a good day's work as no one over there would have done so.Tonight we on this side are participating in a charade as we have been denied the opportunity for a question and answer session today or tomorrow and huge play is made of the fact that we got an extra hour and a half tonight. We have more time to make statements but no time to get answers. The Taoiseach promised to answer our questions tomorrow and I will make it easy by making it clear when I am asking questions. The Tánaiste has given no commitment to answer questions but as many questions can be asked of her. We have no choice but to take part in this charade because if we did not, all semblance of democracy would be gone from this House.I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on his interim report, which was detailed, definite and courageous, and has been almost a best seller. The fact that almost 100,000 citizens accessed it in one form or other is indicative of how the nation feels about this issue. People want answers and the truth, and this House, not the media, should be their means of getting it.

In the end the truth will be got at and everyone involved will be caught. That warning is unwritten but clearly evident from the report.The Taoiseach seems to view this discussion as almost irrelevant. I do not take a swipe at his absence tonight as I fully accept the importance of why he is where he is, but at his attitude earlier today and before. He tells us that he has nothing new to say and that we should look at what he said in 1997 and 1998, which we should do. On 28 May 1998, he was asked by Deputy Quinn if he specifically asked Ray Burke, before Deputy Dermot Ahern went to London, whether he got  money from Murphy. He replied that he had not and went on to say that his concern was whether he had got the money. Earlier, in September 1997, in a radio interview the Taoiseach said that Mr. Burke had assured him that he had received £30,000 but that he had done nothing wrong. Perhaps I am missing something but the Taoiseach needs to explain that.Deputy Dermot Ahern visited London and had a tour of the vegetation of north Dublin. We are told that he carried out all due inquiries that were reasonably possible but discovered no proof that any payment, improper or otherwise, was made. All the time it appears that the Taoiseach and others knew that Mr. Burke had received £30,000. Did the Taoiseach impart this knowledge to Deputy Ahern prior to his wonderful investigation? One of the most serious findings in the report is that the broadcasting legislation which Mr. Burke brought in to cap RTE's advertising revenue was "in response to demands of him by the promoters of Century and was not in the public interest."  The effects of that are still being felt by RTE and the staff there must be hoping that the man with their future in his hands has some hidden talents since he is clearly not an investigator.It is important that while we remember that truth, honesty and integrity were sacrificed for the pursuit of personal gains, there are other real victims, real people. Ray Burke sold the future of Dublin's hinterland to a clique of property developers against the professional advice of planners. Housing developments were voted through against the advice of planners and council officials. People paid high prices for homes – these were not just houses but homes. It was a lifetime investment but there was no proper infrastructure, no shops, schools, churches or public transport. Some houses were of terrible quality and some did not even have proper drainage. These people still have to pay their mortgages and their dreams of becoming home owners have been shattered by the reality of what they purchased. Now they also have to deal with the knowledge that someone other than the developers got rich on their hardship.The Taoiseach knew that Ray Burke got £30,000 so why did he appoint him to Cabinet? Why did he not act on the information given to him by Albert Reynolds, the former Taoiseach? Did he truly believe, despite what the then Deputy Reynolds told him, despite what Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn did or did not tell him, that Ray Burke had done nothing wrong? Why did he choose not to look further into the comments of the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, when he said that zoning in Dublin County Council was a debased currency? Why did he not ask the Minister, Deputy Smith, even in private, what had made him say that? What sort of judgment has the Taoiseach that in spite of all this, he still appointed him to Cabinet? I do not understand how he can protest at the notion in people's minds that there is more to it.I also have questions for the Tánaiste. She claims that if she knew then what she knows now, the issue of Ray Burke serving in Cabinet would never have arisen, but she knew of the allegations that Mr. Burke took bribes in return for planning permission. She had been told this by a director of JMSE and by the now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. She at least knew of the allegations and stated here tonight that she had two choices in 1997, to accept the Taoiseach's assurances or refuse to do so and refuse to accept Ray Burke's appointment as Minister. She wanted to base a new Government on a foundation of trust and partnership, and by any measure that failed. She may have a partnership but she certainly has very little trust.How could the Progressive Democrats accept fresh assurances from the same Taoiseach only two weeks ago? The self-styled guardian angel of Fianna Fáil has clipped her wings and buried her halo in the debris of north Dublin development in the interests of forming a Government and getting into office. She admitted here tonight that she was willing to accept the Taoiseach's assurances because she was determined to show that the Progressive Democrats could work successfully in a partnership Government. There cannot be a less important reason for forming a Government. Deputy McDowell, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, conceded that the inquiries carried out were at best very inadequate.The Tánaiste in 1997 probably thought, like she did on at least one occasion since, that it would all blow over in a few days but this, I assure her, is going to run and run. Like the previous Administration's Independent Deputies, the Tánaiste and her party colleagues seem determined to prop up Fianna Fáil and this Government to keep them in power regardless of what happens. She is its new Jacqueline Healy-Rae.Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have questions to answer. Did the Taoiseach tell the Tánaiste what Albert Reynolds had told him? Did he tell her that Mr. Burke had confirmed to him before September 1997 that he had got £30,000? Did he tell her the cursory nature of the inquiry he had conducted and that all he had done was to send Deputy Dermot Ahern to ask one man one question? It has taken 28 years to get this far. How much longer is the leader of Fianna Fáil prepared to hide? Until he answers these questions, the Government will live under a shadow, a shadow passed by his cowardice.

Sin an rud tábhachtach. Cad a tharla, cén chaoi a tharla sé, cé bhí ag éisteacht agus cé a d'inis agus cé nár inis an fhírinne?This is a very important debate and I regret the views of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Minister who spoke before him. It is of extreme importance to the people because it is fundamental to how the public regard the running of the country for so many years by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The manners, methods and ethos of Government and politics are at stake here. On this side of the House we reject totally and utterly the corruption, bribery and evil that is at the heart of the Flood tribunal.As my colleague said, Raphael Burke sold his soul for money, for a free house. Imagine being bought for a house, and thousands and thousands of pounds delivered in taxis by four or five builders. That is shameful and disgraceful. It is a matter of great import to us that this report is before the House and that it be discussed.As a Senator, I was in this House in the Visitors Gallery when the former Minister, Mr. Burke, spoke about his line in the sand, about how upset he was by what was being said about him and how he was putting all those things behind him. Now we know the truth. We know what a sham and what a lie the whole affair was for him.As Members we have to address how we look at planning and how to reform the law in terms of inducements that may be offered to elected representatives to vote one way or the other, or to public officials. I agree with proposals from all sides of the House that the process will have to be changed, that there should be an overview and that a High Court judge should look at and vouch for the integrity of each development plan. A more fundamental issue is the transparency at local level of that plan as it is being made. Local authority plans are not made at county council level but at a sub county council level – at a planning meeting for an area. When development plans are being discussed it is essential that, ab initio, the press is present at those meetings—

That is not the case now. When a plan is made for a village or town once every five or six years there should be a vote, a plebiscite, of that community to accept  or reject it in its totality after amendments have been put by the elected members and officials. The reality about planning is that it belongs to the people and not to the politicians and officials. They should stand over the public and say whether they want a particular plan. Planning should go through that process. Given that the planning process is at least a five or seven year cycle I see no reason for not proceeding in this way.In my county of Louth – this is not a political point in the narrow sense – local councillors in Dunleer have rejected a plan put forward by the planning consultants. They propose to make the village of Dunleer two or three times bigger than the local people wish. This is a disgrace. If and when plans for villages such as Dunleer are put to people to accept or reject, then there will be absolute clarity about what the people want and what the public representatives have to do.Anyone who regularly reads Sunday newspapers such as The Sunday Business Post, Sunday Independent, etc., knows there will be a planning scandal, that a politician will be named, that some back room boy, as reported last Sunday, was getting £1,000 per week for renting out his integrity to some developer. These scandals are unacceptable. The Progressive Democrats who think they have the moral high ground on these issues should leave the Government and sit with us and oppose what has been going on. It is a charade and it has gone on for years. While that party continues to support the Government it has no credibility left. Prior to the election the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, hung up a poster about not having a one party State or a Fianna Fáil Government on its own. Effectively, he is guarantor of that Government. I call on him, if he has not already contributed to the debate, to tell the House what is in the file he read at the weekend. He will not allow us to question him but will he please tell the House what he knows because we have not seen the file.

The bottom line is that we have to clean up our politics, change the planning laws and have debates such as this. There should be no problem in having a question and answer session with the Taoiseach or any other Minister. That is what democracy is all about. It is about getting to know the facts and telling the House what one knows. If one has nothing to hide why not answer the questions?The bottom line is that young people must not be allowed to lose respect for the political system. It is important for us that young people continue  to get involved in politics. It is only by transparency and openness in the planning system and of all our actions and activities that they will be happy to get involved with political parties and will respect those in politics. They will listen to us and we will certainly listen to them. The question I have, which is not for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, but the general public, is whether it would buy a used car from the Government. The answer is "no" because it has no credibility, either in terms of the way it has managed the economy or the way it has managed this debate by its refusal to answer the questions.

Mr. Justice Flood has done the State an enormous service by exposing corruption at the highest level. This report has been a success by any standard using those terms. Mr. Justice Flood has single-handedly renewed the public's faith in tribunals as a way of exposing wrongdoing in Irish political life. His record and his service to the State in this regard will stand the test of time.We have had many tribunals during the past 20 years. Each time a report has been published arising from those tribunals, the public's faith in the ability of those tribunals to deliver a concise and objective judgment has diminished, ending up with the report on the beef tribunal. Mr. Justice Flood has turned that around almost 180º and renewed the public's faith in this method of investigating and exposing wrongdoing in public life. He is to be commended.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I was making a general point. In regard to the past few years I accept the fact that a number of tribunals have renewed the public's faith in their efficacy. Mr. Justice Flood's conclusions are clear, concise, forthright and trenchant in what they say, namely, lest there be any doubt, that extremely wealthy people in this country had no difficulty in subverting the planning process to make huge windfall profits and that, at the same time, there were politicians who were willing to aid and abet them in that process. There were willing people in the professions, not least my own former profession, who aided and abetted this conspiracy to subvert the planning process in this country. That is a serious allegation to make but it is a valid one, and the conclusions of the report substantiate that clear statement.Arising out of the three points I have made, the greatest success of this report is that it will demonstrate in the clearest terms to people in public life, or those who aspire to serve in public life, that this sort of activity, this sort of corrupt behaviour, will not and cannot be tolerated, and it will be exposed. If one decides to go into public life and if one is predisposed towards this type of behaviour, think again, think twice and think three times about this.The evidence has been laid bare for all to see, it is clear and forthright. However, we must be careful in how we approach the debate and ensure that Members do not abuse the privilege which is afforded to each and every one of us so as to make possible future trials and convictions unsafe and unsound because of prejudicial statements in this House.I congratulate the Taoiseach, the last Government and this House for proposing and setting up the Flood tribunal in 1997. Although it has taken a long time for the tribunal to report, it has been worth the wait for exposing the level of corruption and wrongdoing in the planning process. The efficacy of the planning process is central to the way in which we conduct public affairs in this country. Most of us in this House deal with myriad issues in our offices and clinics, but the one issue that consistently comes up in my clinic is planning, from the small extension to the garden shed to multi-unit commercial developments of hundreds of houses. They are the issues which concern the public, and if there is a question mark over that process there is a question mark over public life and over people involved in politics.Mr. Justice Flood has gone a long way towards cleaning up that process, or at least towards making it more difficult for anybody who may seek to go down that road again. In that respect he has done the State a great service. Mr. Justice Flood has also shown that public tribunals can be very cost-effective. To date, the tribunal has cost €25 million. I am sure that figure will double. I believe it will treble by the time it is finished, but this money will have been well spent for the purposes of exposing serious corruption and wrongdoing. The Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau have confirmed that, as a direct result of the inquiries made by Mr. Justice Flood, €34.5 million has been recovered. This is a massive vindication, not only of Mr. Justice Flood, but of the officials and the legal team who worked with the tribunal, and of the efficacy of tribunals themselves. The decision of the Taoiseach and the Government to extend the terms of reference of the tribunal has been entirely justified by the interim report of Mr. Justice Flood. For these reasons I welcome the report.One of the true tests of any democratic society is its ability to deal with serious wrongdoing in public life. Over the past ten years this country has come to terms with that difficult issue in a forthright and honest way. I hate to use the expression again, but there has been a lot done  and an awful lot more to do in this regard. The Government has not waited in the meantime for the results of the tribunal, but has introduced its own legislation, including the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2001, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act, 2001, as well as introducing the Director of Corporate Enforcement to remove the veil of security which corporate entities can give to their beneficial owners.The publication of the interim report of Mr. Justice Flood and his tribunal is a profoundly significant and welcome development in Irish life. It sounds a clear message – those who act improperly or illegally while engaged in public life can be sure that their actions will be exposed and the law enforced against them. The risk of such exposure is probably the greatest deterrent against people in public life engaging in corrupt and dishonest practices.I have talked at length about the importance and significance of this report in terms of where it fits into the dynamic of public life in Ireland, and I have repeated myself on a number of occasions. In doing so, I serve to illustrate a central point, namely, that the Opposition has completely missed the import and the significance of this report—

Focusing on what happened five years ago in political terms, the Opposition fails to recognise that this report is now in the hands of the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the collector general and other enforcement bodies. This report – one of many I hope – will be acted upon. I make these points to illustrate the fact that the Opposition, as Deputy Ó Cuív said, is missing the wood for the trees—

I welcome the publication of the Second Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments carried out by the then sole member of the tribunal, the Honourable Mr. Justice Flood. This tribunal was set up under ministerial order by the previous Dáil on 4 November 1997. It has taken almost five years to get to this stage in its deliberations.This is a comprehensive report but it is also a frightening document as it exposes the abuse of power by a former Member and former Minister. As a life-long member of Fianna Fáil, I find it distressing to discover that a member of Fianna Fáil should be found by Mr. Justice Flood to be corrupt. However, I do not believe this is a time for political points scoring because it is much more serious than that.I have spent the past 27 years working as a family doctor. During that time I have seen a lot of human nature. I believe that a capacity for good and evil exists all the time. That is why, as a State, we have laws so that evil can be punished. Our democracy is a precious thing and the cornerstone of any democracy is not only that things are right in public life but that they are seen to be so. This is not the time or place for equivocation. If a public representative, be it at local, regional, national or international level, receives money or rewards from an individual or a group so that he or she carries out a certain course of action on their behalf which may or may not be contrary to the public good, then that is a bribe. Bribery leads to corruption and corruption attacks the foundation of democracy.The litany of corruption this tribunal has discovered is frightening. It is a severe shock to our democracy. I welcome this exposure of corruption and I applaud the sterling work of the tribunal to date. I also welcome the forwarding of this report to the DPP so that he can take whatever action he considers appropriate. It is regrettable that the sole member of the tribunal had to conclude that certain parties who appeared before him chose not to co-operate with the tribunal in its task.As to the future, I hope the tribunal will be speedily completed and I urge all who appear before it to co-operate fully so its final findings can be laid before this House as soon as possible. I look forward also to any recommendations it may make in relation to amendments to existing legislation in the areas of planning, local government, ethics in public office or otherwise.I have been a Member of this House only since June of this year but I have been a member of Sligo County Council since 1991. In all of that time I have never heard or seen anything to suggest that any level of bribery or corruption occurred. I might add that I have engaged in many discussions with planning officials of Sligo County Council in relation to issues pertaining to planning and at all times I have found the officials to be extremely courteous and fair. They make their recommendations to the county manager, who is the ultimate decision maker. Sometimes I do not agree with those decisions. In particular, I frequently have a problem with decisions made in relation to rural planning. I believe strongly that every effort should be made to retain people in rural areas, but that is a debate for another  time. I emphasise that at no time have I ever heard any rumour or story of any degree of corruption, but we must be eternally vigilant. If any member of the public is aware of any wrongdoing, it must be reported to the appropriate authorities.Our democracy is founded on the rule of right over the evil of wrong. Abuse of a position of authority, be it a public representative or an official, is wrong and must be condemned in the strongest possible manner. The report before the House has exposed corruption and for that we must acknowledge the good work carried out by the tribunal. We must all learn to be extremely vigilant and must ensure that whatever steps are necessary in the future to safeguard our democracy are undertaken. In that regard, I commend the Government for the legislation it has introduced and is introducing which will ensure that what happened in the past, as is detailed in this report, will not be allowed to occur in the future.There is no doubt that there is widespread anger in the community about the contents of this report, and that anger and disgust is entirely justified. However, I will end this contribution by making a plea that the forthcoming referendum is not allowed to become a focus for that anger. The Nice treaty referendum has nothing to do with the contents of this report. They are separate issues and must be considered as such. I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on his report and wish him and the new tribunal members every success in the speedy completion of their difficult and demanding task.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I want to share time with my colleagues, Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Seán Ryan, and regret that we have so little time to discuss this matter.We have heard two decent speeches from two new Fianna Fáil Members and I accept entirely what they have said at face value, although I am amazed at the ability of Deputy Power to make a contribution in such a detached and erudite manner as if all these terrible events took place in some foreign land about which his party would know nothing. It reminds me of the time the Taoiseach fought a three or four day battle to keep the name of Ray Burke out of the terms of reference. Similarly, Deputy Devins's remark that people should report these matters to the authorities was amazing. They did. There were three separate Garda investigations in this matter from 1974, arising out of Joe McAnthony's article, and all ran into the sand for whatever reason.It is a disgraceful indictment of the Government that this House has been in suspension for the past two weeks when we could have been discussing this tribunal report and getting answers and accountability in a fashion that the report warrants given the amount of work that has gone into it, the €22 million it has cost and the time it  has taken, but the report exploded in the face of the Government. For two days the Government parties were traumatised. They did not know what response to make. The Taoiseach was at the ploughing championships and he took refuge in his usual mangling of the English language that has served him so well in times of crisis. The Progressive Democrats were traumatised into virtual silence and the Government parties together were completely taken aback by the anger of the public as they queued at Molesworth Street to buy this report, which is a better seller than Roy Keane's autobiography.It is worth recording in this debate the reason the Government parties were left gasping for air. After all, the inquiry into Ray Burke's conduct in public office has always been a time bomb ticking underneath this Government and its predecessor, so why were Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats caught in the headlights? The answer is straightforward. They anticipated another whitewash such as the one we got in the beef tribunal. After all, everything that conceivably might have been done to torpedo Flood was done. His inquiry was obstructed and hindered at every legal corner. Stories designed to undermine the tribunal were planted at various critical junctures. Documents were destroyed and withheld and the tribunal treated to fairy tales as well as disrespect. Most seriously of all, concerted sustained efforts were made to ridicule his performance, and the tribunal appeared to go on forever and at enormous public expense.The result was that, mentally, the Government parties had written off Flood. Fianna Fáil had sawed off Ray Burke like a Coillte worker might saw off a branch of a tree in north Dublin, the climbing of which so exhausted our Taoiseach. The Progressive Democrats, ever to the manor born, are so busy governing an unruly and ungrateful people that they did not want to be distracted from the serious business of Government by what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, called "something that is in the past".Apparently there was no conviction that the sole member could square the circle. As in the beef tribunal, it was expected that he would summarise the evidence in a complex, impenetrable presentation and avoid making findings of fact or drawing conclusions. The view was that the people were sick of the evidence anyway and was it not in the newspapers and on the Vincent Browne radio programme every day? In other words, there would be nothing new.When Mr. Justice Feargus Flood decided to call a spade a spade, the Government was so caught off balance it looked possible for almost a week that it would implode. Coming on top of hammer blow after hammer blow that exposed its fraudulent salesmanship on the economy, the Govern ment was, as my constituency colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, described it, rudderless. Last year he said that half the Government should be sacked and I said at the time that he was only half right.The Flood report has been a shock to the Government, the elite in our society and most especially to the golden circle who believed they were untouchable. It has also been a shot in the arm not only for the tribunal of inquiry system, as Deputy Power said, but for the political system itself.Mention of setting up the tribunal reminds me that when the gravity of Mr. Justice Flood's report dawned on the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, he immediately started the mantra, repeated by the Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, and others, that he set up the tribunal. Apart from the technicality that it was the Oireachtas that set up the tribunal, everyone knows that public opinion and Opposition advocacy in this House dragged the tribunal out of an unwilling Government and a reluctant Taoiseach. In fact, it was more serious than that. The Taoiseach and his Government resisted the setting up of the tribunal until the Magill story made it no longer tenable to do so. The Government could not be sustained if the Taoiseach continued to resist.I draw the attention of the House, and I wish I had more time, to page 7 of the report of the tribunal where the sole member draws attention to what happened on the day after Ray Burke's statement in the House on 10 September. He adverts to an amendment I put down which, in the event, was defeated by 76 votes to 69. At paragraph 1-17 the sole member states:This amendment, if passed, would have included the preliminary investigation into the payment of JMSE's money to Mr. Burke in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal. The amendment was rejected by 76 votes to 69.In other words, there would have been a preliminary investigation. The Government voted it down. At paragraph 1-19 His Lordship states:On the 1st October, 1997, in answer to Question 13 put to an Taoiseach by Mr. Pat Rabbitte, T.D, an Taoiseach Mr. Bertie Ahern T.D. informed the House that the Government had decided that a new Tribunal would be established to investigate all matters relating to the parcels of land referred to in Mr. Bailey's letter and any related matters.On 7 October the Taoiseach advised the House that he had accepted Mr. Burke's resignation from the Government and the Dáil. On the same day Deputy Noel Dempsey moved the motion to set up the tribunal, following detailed discussions with the Whips. I am certain, for reasons which I do not wish to record, that the two events – Mr. Burke's resignation from the Dáil and the setting  up of the tribunal – are connected. I believe the Taoiseach gave Mr. Burke an undertaking that there would be no tribunal. When he was forced to set up a tribunal or see his Government fall, Mr. Burke resigned in high dudgeon, feeling betrayed by the man he felt he had made Taoiseach. That was the reason the Taoiseach voted down by 76 votes to 69 my amendment No. 27, that would have required the Moriarty tribunal to conduct a preliminary investigation into the Burke donation to determine whether there was a prima facie case to warrant a full inquiry.It can be seen, therefore, how misleading it is for the Taoiseach to claim that he set up the tribunal as if to convey that he wanted to get to the bottom of the allegations in the public domain. In fact, he wanted to do the opposite and had given an undertaking to Mr. Burke to that effect. After the Magill story on 25 September, he could no longer hold the line. Indeed, as Whip at the time, I remember the attempt to keep his name out of the ultimate terms of reference.I adduced these passages in the report to highlight how blatantly misleading is the Taoiseach's claim about who and why the tribunal was set up. His Chief Whip and other Fianna Fáil Deputies have repeated this mantra ad nauseam. The truth is the opposite. Having hidden behind the shield of supposedly setting up the Flood tribunal for the last two weeks, the Taoiseach comes into the House today to argue that he has no responsibility to answer to the House for the tribunal report because he is hardly mentioned in it. Last week he was claiming ownership of it. I notice that the text of the two Deputies' speeches has now changed to refer to the tribunal that was set up by the Oireachtas. For the last two weeks it has been the tribunal set up by the Taoiseach.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	600	It is this kind of simply unbelievable evasion that has brought politics into disrepute in the eyes of so many citizens. Why, even now, can the Taoiseach not deal with this inglorious chapter in his party's history in an open, straightforward and comprehensive way? Instead he continues to make it up as he goes along, hoping that a debate, disgracefully already delayed for two weeks, will be replaced by other events. He knows and the country knows that he and Ray Burke were political Siamese twins who soldiered together for almost 25 years in Government and Opposition. That is not to allege that the habits of Ray Burke were the habits of Bertie Ahern. It is to state, however, that the Taoiseach, in whatever capacity, could scarcely have escaped knowledge of some of Mr. Burke's financial adventures.The big question he must answer tomorrow is: why did he insist on appointing Burke to a senior  Cabinet office? Why did he send Deputy Dermot Ahern on a fool's errand to London? After his appearance before the tribunal Deputy Ahern qualifies for membership of the UEFA inspection team that recently visited our capital city to inspect one non-existent stadium and another that does not permit soccer and proclaimed itself well pleased with the outcome. Deputy Ahern came back empty-handed and only reverted to Mr. Murphy of JMSE, not for the purposes of finding out whether he indeed gave Ray Burke £30,000 – or £100,000 today – but rather to ask him if he had any dirt on any member of the Opposition that Ray Burke could use when answering questions on 10 September. New members of Fianna Fáil might be shocked at this, but it is all true and checkable.Helping Ray Burke dish the dirt on the Opposition had become Deputy Ahern's objective by 10 September. Did any Opposition member get a donation of whatever character from JMSE? If one reads the transcript of the tribunal, Deputy Ahern's evidence is, to put it mildly, unedifying. He sought to deny that these phone calls were made until counsel for JMSE produced the logs. The extraordinary question is why the Taoiseach failed to tell Deputy Ahern what he knew before he went to London. More amazingly, we know now from former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds that his successor, Deputy Ahern, was fixed with knowledge since 1994. In a matter of days after being informed of concerns about Ray Burke in 1994 and receiving files from former Minister Máire Geoghan-Quinn, he brought Ray Burke out of the wilderness and onto his Front Bench. It is fair to say that he would have appointed him to the Cabinet if that Government had not collapsed.The only reasonable conclusion is that the Taoiseach did not want to know. The same conclusion applies in respect of his failure to ask his party treasurer, now Deputy Seán Fleming. Nor did he want to know what Mr. James Gogarty had to say. One man who did know what Mr. Gogarty had to say was the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. What did he say to his leader, Deputy Harney, before she acquiesced in Burke's appointment? She already had her own troubling information from a JMSE executive who was the husband of a PD candidate. Why did she not put her foot down? Now, five years later, the leader of the cavalry to rescue this Government from implosion is the same Deputy McDowell.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The report of the Flood tribunal is a damning indictment of my former constituency colleague Mr. Ray Burke, who was born and reared less than a quarter of a mile from my own home in Portrane. We went to the national school together, played football together and both ended up in politics, but that is as far as the comparisons  go. Hundreds of ordinary, hard-working Fianna Fáil personnel who gave loyal service to Ray Burke and his father before him have been utterly betrayed. While most of them were walking the roads for Ray Burke he was receiving massive amounts of money from builders and developers.The report outlines a series of payments to Mr. Burke from a number of quarters. It also reveals a sordid and disgusting aspect of public life in the 1980s and 1990s. It is an outstanding and very concise report which has surprised many, particularly the journalists who have been endeavouring to undermine the work of Mr. Justice Flood and his team over the years. In this report Mr. Justice Flood has called a spade a spade. He says there is no such thing as a free lunch and never has been. If people receive substantial contributions it can only be in return for services rendered or for the expectation of services in the future. On the basis of this report many people, such as politicians both national and local and builders, developers and their agents, will be quaking in their boots.Most of those involved in this process felt they were untouchable. They go as far as to acknowledge receipts of contributions of various amounts, depending on their importance in the chain of events, for election purposes. These contributions were alleged to be in the interests of democracy and nothing could be proven. Previous investigations could not come up with the evidence, but Mr. Justice Flood is a different proposition. Fianna Fáil is endeavouring to send out a message that things have changed since Deputy Bertie Ahern became Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is the person, we should note, who nominated Ray Burke to office when he knew that Mr. Burke had received at least £30,000 from Joseph Murphy and that Mr. Murphy himself had denied making this payment to Deputy Dermot Ahern.As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, Ray Burke was the rotten apple in the barrel and things have moved on. As far as I am concerned things have not changed much. Other people named in the report, such as the Baileys, P. J. Mara and John Finnegan, are members of Fianna Fáil or major contributors to the party.They are all part of the Fianna Fáil family and will continue as such in the future. On a personal basis and in the interests of politics, I am pleased the allegations of corruption to the planning process in County Dublin have been publicly acknowledged. I regret I do not have the time to go into this issue but I was in Fingal County Council at the time when we saw what was going on. We have seen the builders, developers and those mentioned in the report in the chambers endeavouring to bring about change.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	602	In the time available to me I would like to raise some questions which should be answered on the basis of the Flood report in regard to radio, particularly the project called Century Radio. Chapter 9-07 of the Flood report refers to a very specific and worrying phenomenon. I wish the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was here to listen to some of this, which he believes is not important. Níl práinn ag baint leis, to use his phrase. Chapter 9-07 states:Some RTE personnel learned of a proposal in an informal way at the meeting which took place, on 6th February 1990, with the Department officials. On the 27th February 1990 the matter was raised specifically in the Dáil by Deputy Mitchell, and responded to by Mr. Burke in a manner which could only be interpreted as a denial that any such plans were afoot. A proposal to divert licence fee income was contained in proposed legislation which Mr. Burke laid before the Dáil on the 29th May 1990.I want to specifically ask a question for answer tomorrow by the Taoiseach. What was in the memorandum for Government for that legislation on the date I referred to in 1990? I was the Minister who lifted the cap on RTE. I knew what I had to do. I had to consult colleagues, I had to consult Ministers in both parties that formed the Government and the officials had to consult other officials. I find it incredible that there was no stated reason in a memorandum for Government in 1990 when the cap was being put on. A number of questions flow from this. Perhaps the Cabinet colleagues were completely conned by arguments that had nothing to do with the promoters of Century Radio who were talking to Mr. Burke. Remember Mr. Burke had met the bankers of Century Radio.The Minister assured those who were promoting the venture that he could help. What did he put in the memorandum? Did he put entirely specious arguments that conned the then Members of the Cabinet or did he share with his Cabinet colleagues, particularly those who were in the same party, the reason he felt it necessary to maim and destroy the national broadcaster to help people whom the Flood tribunal has heard were offering inducements and for which he was facilitating the award of a national radio licence? There was no recommendation technically or in principle for this radio licence by the Department of Communications which had responsibility in this regard. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, thinks there is no urgency in this regard, there is the same urgency there was in keeping the Irish Press in place before it was destroyed as a newspaper. I wish there was not a line in the sand, stopping in 1997, that went right back to the foundation and operation of that paper.Let me say why Century Radio is important. It is of the utmost importance that this matter is resolved. On what basis was legislation put through this House in which people decided to damage the national broadcaster?

Let us have the answer.I want to raise other questions. Let us have the answer to questions about other colleagues of Mr. Burke. Did they discuss with him his proposals for changes in the oil and gas regime in regard to offshore licences or were they independent actions also? Did any of them discuss with him their concerns in regard to the issue of passports? I listened to a great number of speeches this evening and one of the charming attributes of many people on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench these days is a brass neck. There was a suggestion, for example, that the Opposition should have gone to the Taoiseach and discussed privately with him what was bothering it. Would it have to queue behind a former Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, and a former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn? Why would he listen to them if he was not listening to his former Cabinet colleagues?I liked the idea of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney's pathetic reference that she had to demonstrate her trust. She stated that the reputation had gone around that the Progressive Democrats were pressing too much for heads and so on in government. She said she did so because she wanted to base the new Government on a foundation of trust and co-operation of partnership. In a previous coalition with Fianna Fáil the Progressive Democrats had been branded, fairly or unfairly, as a party that was totally unreasonable and too quick in forcing resignations and blocking appointments. How pathetic. What an admission and how complicit it makes her party in what happened.

One comes into public life with honesty, integrity and a good name, and is tax compliant. I would like to think that when the 55 new TDs finish our term in this House our honesty, integrity and good names willl be intact and that we will continue to be totally tax compliant.I listened very attentively in my office to the contributions this evening. I want to be part of anything that is good about life in Ireland and I do not want to be part of anything that is not good, whether business, politics or anything to do with family Iife. My name was mentioned in the House this evening by Deputy Cuffe in regard to an action plan for the village of Delvin, County Westmeath. Councillors of all parties in Westmeath are endeavouring to do something about the decline in the population in the north of the county, while everywhere else in the county is absolutely bursting at the seams. Areas in County Westmeath must join together as clubs to get a minor hurling team. Our area is not an attractive place for development. There is no employer in Delvin apart from St. Mary's Hospital. We trusted the council, planners and the very eminent people who have gone on to other local authorities in the past 15 years. None of their proposals for the county plan worked.Under the action plan proposed for Delvin, the Government has seen fit to make €995,000 available to upgrade the sewerage scheme. This equates to 40% of the cost while the other 60% must come from developments in the area. In an effort to raise these funds we proposed an action plan for the village, all within the speed limit of the village. I was incorrectly named tonight for the first time in the House. Anything I ever did either in public life or as an employer was honest, open and decent. I would like to think that my good name will not be tarnished by a political remark made here this evening. I congratulate all Deputies of all political parties who are doing their utmost, as has the Ceann Comhairle throughout his political life. He has provided us all with a great example in dealing with political matters. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to clarify my position because I was upset when the statements were made about me.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Like other Members, I welcome the findings of Mr. Justice Flood in his interim report of the tribunal. His meticulous work and that of his legal team deserve to be commended because undoubtedly, over many months, there was a lot of obstruction and obfuscation. Mr. Flood experienced a lot of difficulties with many witnesses and he is to be commended for the very clear and concise fashion in which he drafted his report.However, it is very sad for any Member of this House to have to read those findings. They are findings of disgraceful conduct by a former Member, a person who had the trust not only of his constituents but of this House as a Deputy and as a Minister. There are also findings of disgraceful conduct by members of the business community.I find it really ironic that opprobrium is being heaped upon the current generation of politicians  for the actions of former politicians. After all, we are the generation who, as politicians, set up tribunals, resourced them and introduced new legislation, ethics and standards. We are the people who demand—

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I am saying that we in this House are people of high standing who have the faith of our constituents. We stand for public life and all that is good in it. We are here to serve our constituents with the highest of standards and every Member of this House shares in that, as indeed does Deputy Rabbitte. We want to ensure that the conduct of public life is such that we can restore the faith of the public in us as politicians, who are elected to do an honourable job in an honourable way.We will do whatever it takes to do that. If it means having stronger legislation, we will draft it. If it means setting up further bodies to monitor compliance, we will do that as well. It is not pleasant for a lot of people, but that does not matter because we have to ensure that the essential work will continue and that the work of the tribunals will continue to expose what went on in the past. That is why, when we established the McCracken tribunal, upon which I made my maiden speech just five years ago, I spoke of what we are speaking of today – high standards in high office. We have to be prepared to further resource the DIRT inquiry and Moriarty tribunal if necessary.It must be very frustrating for the public to find that, as a result of all these tribunals, the reports have no legal effect. It is frustrating that we cannot use them within our constitutional order and that it is necessary for other bodies and other regulating agencies to take matters a step further. Groups such as the DPP, the Garda Síochána, the Director of Corporate Law Enforcement and the Criminal Assets Bureau have to go back and retrace the ground that has already been covered. It is necessary for them to operate within a particular structure. If the findings had legal effect, they would not be operating within that structure.It would not be acceptable to re-examine the legislation which sets up the tribunals and their terms of reference now, but when the current tribunals are over there will be a case for such re-examination to give them some real teeth so that  their findings can be used. Obviously, the ultimate desirable situation would be one where one would have judicial tribunals which would link the rights within the constitutional framework, but that is another day's work.That is not to say that we will do nothing. As the Taoiseach announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, as can be seen in An Agreed Programme for Government and the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and as prioritised this week in our legislation, we will be bringing forward legislation this session to establish a corruption assets bureau. This is to ensure that the findings of this tribunal report can be used where corruption has been discovered to seize assets, freeze assets and put today's value on them to ensure that the public can regain some of the money it has lost. That is something that can be worked on fairly quickly.While all the other bodies are operating it is very important to ensure that we do not frustrate, hinder or obstruct any investigation or any prosecution of any cases. Obviously, that is why we have to be cautious in our comments, but of course we can make legitimate comments on the findings of the report. We endorse the findings that talk about a former Member of this House, Ray Burke, and say that he was a disgrace to himself and to public office.In condemning his behaviour, I also question the Opposition, the sole aim of which this evening seems to have been a concerted effort to turn the debate on the Taoiseach. I notice that some Members have the report with them. I challenge them to read the report and every one of its 400 pages. They will find that there is not one word of criticism of the Taoiseach. If they are just seeking to divert attention from the very serious findings in this tribunal report, they are not serving democracy or the tribunals well.It is a privilege for each of us to serve here. It is a privilege for people to want to serve. Many are called and few are chosen. Each of us stands for very high standards. The type of conduct which is talked about in the report has unfortunately brought a lot of politicians, probably the whole of the political body, into disrepute in the public eye. We need to take resolute action and we have taken it over the past couple of years to show transparency and accountability because we have to reassure people. We have to reassure the public and young people that we are here for decent reasons. We are here as honest people doing an honest day's work. If we do not have the trust of those people, then it will be very difficult for democracy to survive.The findings of the tribunal report are hard to stomach for a lot of people. They are very critical of people and very serious. The report is a victory for democracy because it shows there is no room for corruption in public, business or political life. Particularly in political life there exists a message that if corruption is one's aim, one does not  belong. The message is as clear for Members of this House as it is for local authority councillors, most if not all of whom are doing a very good job representing local communities for no salary or wage. It takes up much of their time and it is important that the public should restore its confidence in them as well.This is only a second interim report by Mr. Justice Flood, not his final report. However, he does indicate on page 1 that in his final report, when he gets to finish it, he will make recommendations as to further legislation and, perhaps, how the Legislature will be able to move forward to protect society from corruption. I look forward to seeing that and I know we in this House will ensure that we work upon his recommendations and ideas to restore faith in the political process.As I said, the report is a damning indictment of a former Member of this House and a serious criticism of many top business people. It has shown a type of culture that existed in the past, and it is important now that each of the agencies to which this report has been forwarded undertakes its work and does so speedily and efficiently. The public is anxious for some result from the report, which should not be left to rest. Our job is to ensure that happens also.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank you, Sir, and the Minister for taking this matter. Castledermot parish originally had four schools, located at Moone, Kilkea, Levitstown and Castledermot. In the 1950s and 1960s the then parish priest, Father Cotter, initiated the erection of four new schools in these areas. I was one of the first students to attend the school in Castledermot. Since then, Moone has been determined as a new parish by the Archbishop, thus Castledermot parish now has three schools, at Castledermot, Kilkea and Levitstown.Regrettably, the school at Castledermot is no longer equipped to meet the needs of a modern day school. According to the Department's guidelines, it is only one third of the required size. Due to the small size of the existing site it is not possible to develop or obtain land adjacent to this, so there is an urgent need to acquire a new site.The school has no proper facilities for the principal, who is attempting to operate in a small box room. The remedial teacher has no proper facilities. I understand the board of management has a grant application with the Department of Education and Science seeking funding to provide proper facilities for this very necessary medium of teaching. I ask that the Minister use his good offices to ensure that the application is addressed  as a matter of urgency. There is no proper playground or physical education facilities at the school and despite the wonderful efforts of the teaching staff in attempting to provide games etc., it is very difficult to do so.The other major concern is the proximity of the N9 national primary route to the school. This is a dangerous situation and despite the wonderful and exhaustive work of the traffic warden, there is concern by all the parents for the safety of their children due to the huge volume of traffic, including lorries and motor cars, passing the school each day. Every morning, lunch time and closing time creates a major headache for all concerned to ensure the safe passage of children to and from the school.The board of management proposed three sites for Office of Public Works investigation, which were brought to the attention of the local authority, Kildare County Council, for its investigations and observations regarding planning, services and so on. I understand the local authority made the observation and recommendation that it is now imperative that the Department ensures the Office of Public Works acts in relation to the purchase of the favoured site.The county development plan of the local authority states that there will be significant growth of the population of the Castledermot area over the next five years. I understand the Department's inspector has recommended a new school for Castledermot. Given that all the evidence strongly supports the provision of a new school, I therefore ask the Minister to ensure that the Department actively pursues this very important matter to secure an early solution.It is not feasible from a safety and facility viewpoint for the teaching staff in the school to provide proper teaching and modern advancement for the children of the Castledermot area. It is imperative that the Department seeks the advice of the Office of Public Works on the problem with proceeding with a new site and to have it rectified as a matter of urgency. The N9 national primary route is adjacent to the school, which is located on a small three cornered site. It is not possible to buy land adjacent to it, nor is it feasible to continue to require that children must access the school under present circumstances.There is a major problem with the provision of schooling at Castledermot. The board of management of the existing school took a lot of trouble to identify sites. There was contact with the Office of Public Works and the local authority but the Office of Public Works appears to be hedging its bets on the matter and is not advancing the necessary purchase of a site to ensure that Castledermot is provided with a proper school. I ask the Minister, as a matter or urgency, to investigate what is hindering the purchase of a site so that the planning and development of the proposed school can proceed.

He is glad the Deputy has given him the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's current position regarding the acquisition of a site for a new school building for Scoil Diarmada, Castledermot, County Kildare.At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, eight mainstream classroom teachers, a shared learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher, both based at the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 277 pupils. The school's facilities consist of seven classrooms, one of which is a double staff room an administration office and Portakabin used by the learning support teacher. The property management section of the Office of Public Works is acting on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally and is exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for Scoil Diarmada. The school authorities will be kept informed of developments.The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation for Castledermot national school. I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to again raise the issue of Monaghan General Hospital. I also thank the Minister for attending the House at this late hour to listen to the debate. There is an urgent need for the Minister to intervene in the Monaghan General Hospital saga, where, in spite of his commitment to me on 27 June 2002 that everything was all right and that services would continue, the hospital was taken off call on 2 July.At one stage patient numbers were reduced to 13 but they have now increased to approximately 70. This has caused chaos all over the region, especially in Cavan General Hospital. It is extending the waiting lists and putting tremendous pressure on families, especially the very young and the elderly.Last December the Minister promised me he would request someone to intervene between the different groups and the health board executives. He again agreed to this when he met me with my Oireachtas colleagues on 4 July. There have been many protests, thousands of words have been written and there has been heated debate on  radio and television, yet the people of Monaghan, especially the sick, suffer.The Minister saw fit to intervene in the Western Health Board when jobs were at stake. Surely the lives and health of the patients of Monaghan should be of at least the same importance. I and two of my party colleagues had a useful meeting with the chief executive officer and two of his colleagues this morning. However, the clear message I received was that little or nothing has happened to bring about realistic dialogue between the executives, consultants and other management at the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group. Another forum has been established and it is supposed to report by 30 November. Review groups are the order of the day, but nothing is being done to restore confidence at either staff or patient level.From my discussions this morning with the chief executive officer I believe there could, and should, be a future for Monaghan General Hospital. The people of Monaghan, including those who own their own businesses, need and deserve an accident and emergency service that will meet most of the needs of the area. A service is needed for heart and stroke cases within the immediate area if lives are to be saved.Between forums and review groups 31 December will be upon us but no junior doctors will have been appointed. That will be the final nail in the hospital's coffin. It is difficult to explain or understand how high profile patients, such as Mr. Taylor from Northern Ireland, can have operations at Monaghan General Hospital, yet Monaghan people cannot avail of the hospital services. Senator George Mitchell was brought in to broker a deal in Northern Ireland by acting as a mediator and I believe that is what is necessary in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. If the Minister cannot act himself or find someone to do the job then he must consider his position because this is an extremely urgent matter.I had personal faith in the Minister and he is aware of that. I tried to work with him for the best possible future of Monaghan General Hospital, however, his failure to deliver on what he promised last January and his failure to take a hands-on approach to the ministry and Monaghan General Hospital, in particular, begs major questions.The restoration of the boiler was necessary and welcome but it is a long way off the promised €7 million. Consultants feel they have to negotiate through The Irish Times, others through the local radio and newspapers, yet hospital staff fear for their jobs and patients fear for their lives. Imagine a heart attack victim having to travel 75 miles on poor roads on the first week in January 2003. That prospect is staring us in the face.

As he is aware it has been taken off-call from 7 July which has created quite a number of problems for us in Monaghan. A critical date is rolling forward and come 1 January we are going to have very severe difficulties in Monaghan.About ten days ago I called on the Taoiseach to establish a forum. Some positive steps in that direction were made at the last meeting of the North-Eastern Health Board but unfortunately I believe that it will not happen at this stage. A number of minor adjustments need to be made to it. Dialogue is the only way forward. We must bring the stakeholders face to face to thrash out a plan that will give a future to the hospital.So far we have had the executive drawing up plans in isolation and the medical board in the hospital devising their own plan. They reject each other's plans. I urge the Minister to consider having another look at the possibility of a forum in order to get the concerned parties talking. We may need to look at the balance of numbers, a critical issue from what I have heard from hospital consultants to date.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I thank Deputies Crawford and Connolly for their contributions. The fundamental responsibility for the provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital rests with the North-Eastern Health Board as it is the statutory authority in the area. It is a matter for the board ultimately to determine the nature and level of service provision at the hospital consistent with the board's commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost effective service.I have met with almost every party involved with Monaghan General Hospital. I met with Deputy Connolly before he was a Deputy when he was on the hospital action committee. I met with Deputy Crawford on a number of occasions, as he has said. I visited Monaghan General Hospital earlier this year and met about 12 delegations. We made commitments then that I have honoured in terms of sanctioning posts. We had discussions with the hospital management, staff and representatives. I have had further discussions with interested parties.The hospital has been taken off call and there has been an interruption of services. That was not my decision nor that of the board. Deputy Crawford did not refer to that in his contribution, but he knows full well, as does Deputy Connolly, that a decision taken by the Royal College of Anaesthetists with regard to accreditation was the critical factor in what transpired there. I assure Deputy Crawford that we did intervene at that stage and we asked the college to look at the situation with the health board to see if they could rearrange things to allow for proper accreditation to take place in order for services to be resumed. The North-Eastern Health Board has advised me that it has sought to resolve these difficulties. The  board and I took the view that we could not bring about a resolution without the input of the relevant professional bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the College of Anaesthetists and the Medical Council as well as Comhairle na nOspidéal. They are the statutory bodies with specific responsibilities for key areas on this issue. Another key element is the co-operation of the clinical staff of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I cannot order a resolution of this problem. We can try and be helpful, which we have been, and I maintain that we have endeavoured to be helpful with regard to seeking a resolution but our proposals have been rejected. Deputy Connolly has suggested that it may have been rejected because of the methodology or the mechanism of the exchanges – the way people are passing various sets of proposals to each other.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The people are not talking to each other.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	622	There was a proposal on the table which may not have given everybody what they wanted but it would certainly have brought back 70% of the surgical activity to the hospital straight away if it was accepted. We have tied up development arrangement on other sites, such as between Naas and Tallaght hospitals in the area of accreditation two years ago to ensure that junior doctors would be appointed. We have done it in other areas across the country where two hospital campuses have been used as a basis for rosters or programmes to facilitate junior doctor training which allows for the concerns of the accrediting body and the Medical Council in terms of safety and standards. There are ways around these issues that would meet everybody's concerns. We must always be mindful of the concerns of those who are charged statutorily by this House in terms of safety standards and so on. These are issues that we cannot simply gloss over. Where there is a will, there is a way and I believe the bodies concerned have certainly been willing to be helpful in terms of finding a solution but it does need everyone else to come on board as well.Both Deputies are aware of the project teams that have been recently established to advise on development of all five acute hospitals in the North-Eastern Health Board area, including Monaghan General Hospital. The primary role of the Monaghan hospital project team is to prepare an outline planning brief for the development of the hospital site. I recently issued approval for funding of the boiler plant upgrade for the amount of €473,000. My Department has approved a number of new services at Monaghan Hospital in recent months. When I was there I said the Department would sanction new consult ant posts in dermatology and in geriatric medicine, which we have done.Other developments recently approved include additional investment in consultant-led surgical and anaesthetic services. Approval has also issued to the board for the recruitment of five additional medical support staff. Comhairle na nOspidéal is looking at some of those issues and I do not have any control over that body. It is a statutory body which regulates the appointment of consultants. It is about time we told people the truth. It is the easiest thing in the world to try and blame the Department or the Minister for Health and Children for everything but we have statutory authorities to whom this House gave certain responsibilities. We might not like the decisions taken from time to time but these structures govern how we do things. There is no point in trying to allocate blame: we need to try and ensure that through working with the bodies and the interested parties we can arrive at solutions to the issues.Over the past three years in excess of €4.064 million has been allocated to the hospital in respect of various capital projects. That money would not have been spent if the intention was to close it. I wish somebody would tell me if that is the objective of the North-Eastern Health Board. We would not have put £1 million into the modular surgical theatre there. I visited it and it is a fine facility which we should be using to reduce waiting lists. That is my position as Minister for Health and Children; I want to see that facility used.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	623	So do I.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I do not see why it cannot be used with a bit of common sense all around if people come out of their entrenched positions. The main projects completed included the refurbishment of the female medical ward. A major equipment replacement programme costing almost €1.27 million was undertaken throughout the hospital, which included specialist cardiology and patient monitoring equipment. More capital investment is proposed in the short term. Plans have been advanced by the health board for the upgrading and development of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the emergency treatment unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital costs for all these is about €7 million.On 16 January last I announced the immediate commissioning of an additional 709 beds in public hospitals nationwide. This is the first phase in the provision of an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. The North-Eastern Health Board said it could provide 38 of those beds this year,  ten of which will be in Monaghan General Hospital – I refer to revenue spent to commission ten extra beds. This combined investment represents tangible evidence of my commitment to the continuing development of services in the region. I have sanctioned these developments and have allocated funding to the health board to carry them out.My Department received proposals from the North-Eastern Health Board today for the establishment of a Monaghan General Hospital forum. I understand from the correspondence, which I only saw after tea, that people indicated at a board meeting last night that they might be in favour of this. I am open to suggestions as to how that mechanism can be developed and to discussing it with the Deputies if they feel it may be a vehicle for breaking the logjam. We will consider it in the Department. There is a suggestion to have an independent chair.The North-Eastern Health Board has consistently advised me and assures me that it is committed to the future provision and development of services at Monaghan hospital. I reiterate what the Deputies have said. It is essential that all parties involved play their part to resolve the present difficulties. I know the feelings of the people in Monaghan on this issue. We have seen the protests. The energy should now be applied to devising a formula which resolves these issues and gets the hospital back into running order.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The Minister for Transport promised shortly after he took office that the penalty points system would be introduced on a phased basis from this autumn. The system was widely welcomed by everyone and we believed a constructive method of reducing road accidents would finally be put in place. It appears it has been put on the long finger once again. What are the Minister's plans for the introduction of the system and, most importantly, when will the first phase be implemented?Penalty points were introduced in Northern Ireland in 1997. The view of the Department of the Environment there six months later was that the penalty points campaign had a significant impact on drivers' attitudes. At a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in April of this year, it was noted that, in regard to mutual recognition of penalty points by both jurisdictions, it could be possible to address such a measure when the system in the South came into operation. It makes good sense to have a common penalty points system in the North and South. Driving patterns are similar and, since 1996, joint safety awareness campaigns have been in use.It is five years since the penalty points system was first mooted and we are still waiting on the implementation of the first phase. We are missing  out on a golden opportunity for constructive co-operation between North and South on an important road safety issue. Is it a matter of funding not being available to progress the implementation of the penalty points system and has it become part of the Government adjustments we have heard about? Some 304 people have died on the roads so far this year. The daily loss of life and number of serious injuries on our roads is too high a price to pay for not making funding available. While the technology may be sophisticated, it is surely not rocket science in this day and age. If it is a matter of the technology being sophisticated, it is up and running in the North and surely technology transfer could be addressed and brought to bear on the system here.Drink-driving and driving under the influence of other drugs continue to plague our roads and to put lives at risk. The number of road deaths in 2001 was 411. On-the-spot fines for speeding, not wearing seatbelts and drink-driving in the same year were impressive. Detection of these breaches of road law is not a problem. However, it is clear that detection and imposition of financial penalties have little or no effect on bad road habits.The penalty points system is effective in other countries and concentrates people's minds when their driving licence is likely to be removed and they are banned from driving. If the Minister is serious about the penalty points system, he should also concentrate on delivering a focused public information campaign to the driving public to make them aware of the system and how it will work. There has not been a word about penalty points in any public information campaign on road safety.The Minister promised the system would be introduced on a phased manual basis from October, but that month has arrived and there is no sign of it. The loss of life on our roads should not be sidelined and put on the back burner. Either the technology should be accessed and made operational or a manual system introduced. Road safety should not be compromised.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I thank Deputy Upton for raising the issue and I will give the reply on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. It gives me the opportunity to state in the House the Government's commitment to the introduction of a system of penalty points. The Government Road Safety Strategy 1998-2002 provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002.As indicated in the Government strategy on road safety, the design of the system required careful consideration in Irish circumstances because of the exclusive constitutional role of the  courts in the administration of justice. This gave rise to protracted examination of the legal issues in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. There could have been no question of proceeding on any basis that entailed uncertainty. Penalty points will be applied in respect of a wide range of minor offences, the commission of which have a potentially negative impact on road safety. These include excessive speeding, red light running, poor lane discipline, non-compliance with stop and yield signs and a number of offences relating to vehicle safety and driver licensing.Excessive speed is recognised as the most significant contribution to road accident causation and has already been the subject of significant investment in enforcement measures by An Garda Síochána, with more than 345,000 speeding notices issued in 2001. The importance of achieving safer speeds is recognised as a key priority of the current road safety strategy. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, is therefore giving high priority to the introduction of a penalty points system on a phased basis, commencing with its application to speeding offences only. Work is at an advanced stage in putting arrangements in place for the limited operation of penalty points, and the Minister expects this system to be operational by Thursday, 31 October 2002. It is widely accepted that road safety strategies must consist of many different policies and measures and that no single measure is sufficient by itself to ensure improved road safety performance. However, it is envisaged that the implementation of a penalty points system to address recurring driving violations, in particular speeding, will significantly improve driver behaviour on our roads.The penalty points system will be operated through the national driver file which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. A project team involving the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service developed a business specification for a penalty points functionality to be added on to the national driver file. The software application of the national driver file has been changed to accommodate a penalty points system. Before the system becomes fully operational, the national driver file must be supported by the IT systems of the courts and the Garda. The development of these IT systems is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a contract for the development of a fixed charge processing system for An Garda Síochána was signed in September 2002 and work on the project is under way. From a Garda Síochána perspective, this computer system will facilitate the full implementation of the  relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 2002. The system is planned to be completed by the end of 2003.As part of the overall computerisation process, electronic interfaces are also planned between the relevant agencies and Departments, that is, An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This is to ensure that the penalty points imposed on offending drivers are recorded on the national driver file maintained by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In the meantime, the limited operation of the penalty points system to which I referred earlier will involve a manual system operated by the Garda and the courts from which the necessary electronic data for transfer to the national driver file will be captured.Since the decision was taken to implement the penalty points system on a temporary manual basis for the offence of speeding, senior management in the Garda Síochána the Courts Service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been intensively engaged with officials of the Department of Transport in the development of the system. It has been necessary to design detailed work processes and procedures to determine how the various agencies involved will interact to give effect to the system on a manual basis. This work is being completed and I understand that briefing of gardaí in relation to the new legislation and processes involved has commenced.The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 October 2002.

The implications of bringing gas ashore are many but the main ones can be summarised as follows. Work on the onshore pipeline including estuary and river crossings has been deferred. Work on the Mayo-Galway export pipeline has been suspended pending the determination by ABP and the delay could have ramifications for the extensions of pipeline supplies to other towns in the north west region. No work will be undertaken in 2003 prior to the receipt of planning determination by ABP. The delay in the planning process has incurred additional costs to the developers. The benefits to the local economy are deferred and the financial return to the developer and partners will be substantially less than forecast. The benefit of a significant source of indigenous energy supply will be deferred.

Under the terms of its licence the Atlantic Dawn must predominantly operate outside EU waters.The vessel is allowed strictly limited access to EU waters as a result of arrangements reached with the European Commission and the Atlantic Dawn company. The company permanently withdrew its other vessel, the Veronica, from the Irish and EU fleet registers, which enabled Ireland to resolve a long standing engine power over capacity situation in the pelagic segment and comply with mandatory EU fleet capacity limits.The Atlantic Dawn is only allowed to fish in EU waters to the same degree, in terms of catch limits and fishing effort, as the Veronica was allowed. The vessel has been allocated the same catch limits for mackerel and herring as those previously given to the Veronica. It may also target other pelagic species such as horse mackerel and blue whiting, as the Veronica was entitled to do, subject to strict effort limitations. There is no increase in fishing effort within EU waters. The situation is, therefore, status quo as far as the rest of the fishing industry is concerned.Under the terms of its licence the Atlantic Dawn is prohibited from fishing within 12 nautical miles of Ireland's baselines and from fishing in the Irish Sea. The vessel's compliance with the terms of its licence with respect to EU waters and elsewhere is closely monitored. The entry of the Atlantic Dawn into the Irish fleet was facilitated by a decision of the European Commission to grant additional capacity and fishing effort to take account of fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and west African waters. The Atlantic Dawn company will continue primarily to focus its attention on developing sustainable fishing opportunities outside the EU and positioning itself as a successful player in the international seafood market.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 104 and 125 together.Globally, renewable energy technologies, including wind, require special support in the short to medium term to ensure significant increased development. In Ireland the current support mechanism is the AER programme – alternative energy requirement. Under this programme projects which are successful in a competitive bidding process are entitled to enter into power purchase agreements, PPAs, with the ESB. The agreements require the ESB to purchase the output from the projects declared successful in AER competitions for up to 15 years at the prices volunteered by the developers.The guaranteed revenue streams reassure credit institutions who will in turn provide debt financing if all other consents are secured, for example, planning permission, an authorisation from AER, confirmed connection. In addition, renewable energy projects which are successful under EU research programmes are also granted PPAs to ensure the viability of the projects. The target for the period 2000 to 2005 is to add 500 MW new renewable energy based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network. My predecessor announced earlier this year the award in principle of power purchase agreements for approximately 350 MW of new wind based electricity generation. The vast majority of these plants are expected to be built in 2003 or 2004.In a change from previous AER competitions, following a recommendation of the renewable energy strategy group, applications in this competition, AER V, were confined to projects with planning consent and the cap on project size which had applied previously was withdrawn. I am, therefore, confident that the build rate among successful applications in AER V will far exceed anything achieved previously. I will announce a further AER round later this year to ensure the overall 500 MW target is delivered. This competition will be conducted in accordance with EU procurement rules and it would be inappropriate of me to comment further in any detail until the prescribed notice is published in the Official Journal.

I have had inquiries made into this matter and the control authorities advise that these vessels are regularly checked, both at sea and on landing into Irish ports, as are all fishing vessels operating within the Irish fisheries patrol area.The Irish Naval Service monitors the fishing activities of Spanish owned, French registered fishing vessels as part of its normal patrol missions. Checks at sea include the inspection of fishing gear used by vessels, using the methods and criteria prescribed under EU fisheries legislation, for compliance with requirements on minimum mesh sizes. Vessels are also boarded at sea and their catches inspected for compliance with EU fisheries legislation governing the minimum sizes of fish. The proper recording of catches is also checked. My Department's land based inspectorate also carries out regular checks of all vessels when they discharge fish into Irish ports.Spanish owned, French registered vessels and all other non-Irish vessels are required to give prior notification of landing, including information on catches aboard the vessel which it is proposed to land. Inspections carried out by my Department's sea fishery officers check the advance notification information against the catches recorded in the European Communities fishing logbook and the actual fish being landed. In addition, checks are made on the fishing gear used by these vessels and on other technical requirements set down in EU fisheries legislation.I am advised that checks, at sea and on land, of Spanish owned, French registered fishing vessels have not resulted in the detection of fisheries offences. This matter will continue to receive due attention from the Irish Naval Service and my Department's land based inspectorate in the context of overall fisheries control and enforcement.

Any application from RTE for an increase in the licence fee will be considered on its merits and having regard to the recommendations of the forum on broadcasting.

The review will seek to identify and evaluate appropriate options for the ownership and corporate governance of the ports, including strategic alliance and wider share ownership possibilities and enhanced private sector involvement. The prime objective of the review is to identify how to ensure that the ports are structured to provide the best service to port users and the Irish economy. A secondary objective is to ensure that the ports have access to adequate funding to meet the longer term infrastructural needs of this sector of the economy. The study is fully inclusive and involves a full consultation process with all relevant stakeholders and interested parties.As I stated publicly at the Irish Ports Association national conference on 27 September last, I have an open mind as to the best management, operation and ownership arrangements for the ports industry and its customers. I have undertaken to publish the study findings when it is completed, which I expect to be in a position to do early next year.

This responsibility currently falls within the remit of the Department's coastal zone management division, which is also charged with regulation and management of the marine coastal zone, including aquaculture, foreshore licensing and control of dumping at sea. The findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report reflect a widespread recognition of the need for a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to coastal zone management.

My Department was notified in accordance with these arrangements in advance of the recent shipment. The Irish Government has the capability to respond to any incident and was aware of the vessels' location once they entered the Irish Sea. The vessels did not enter waters under Ireland's jurisdiction.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The outcome of the Fisheries Council in September was generally satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint. I succeeded in securing an additional quota of Celtic sea herring at the meeting of the Fisheries Council held in Brussels last month. At the Council meeting, Ministers agreed to set a total allowable catch, TAC, of 13,000 tonnes of herring in the Celtic Sea for 2002, replacing the provisional quota of 8,000 tonnes agreed last December. I stressed that it was absolutely vital that Ireland's case for an increase in this TAC was accepted by the Fisheries Council.The Council also held a detailed and constructive policy debate on the Commission's proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. The discussions centered on a number of core issues concerning new arrangements involving multi-annual management of fishery resources, fleet and structural aid policy and also fisheries control and enforcement. I, along with colleagues from five member states – Greece, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, also tabled a common position paper which sets out common positions mainly in relation to fleet policy and resource management, which Ireland is developing with like minded member states. This alliance of common interests demonstrates clearly that the views of coastal communities all across the EU have to be heard in developing a new Common Fisheries Policy. I am satisfied that the interests and concerns of the Irish fishing communities are being well served by the common positions being developed with these member states. I am also optimistic that Ireland's position on the Common Fisheries Policy proposals is gaining ground at the Council table.I outlined Ireland's position on the Commission's proposals for reform of the CFP. I emphasised to my colleagues the need for Council to take a fundamental and systematic review of existing allocations to Ireland of fish stocks and to bring forward proposals that will reflect a fairer and more equitable distribution. I also stressed the importance of maintaining the "Irish Box" in order to limit fleet sizes and fishing activity in this area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The EU Commission brought forward proposals in May 2002 to provide for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP. These proposals include a change in fleet policy. The proposal involves the introduction of limits on fishing effort, that is, days at sea, of between 30% and 60% depending on the state of stocks and the regions. The Commission's objective is to rapidly reduce fleet size by putting in place a system that will make the operation of the current national fleets uneconomic. The fleet reductions are to be achieved through imposing restrictions on the days vessels will be allowed to fish. The total amount of fishing effort, days at sea, the Irish fleet will be allocated will be significantly less than the total that would allow the present fleet to operate on an economic basis and, accordingly, many vessel owners would be forced to scrap their vessels and get out of fishing. The Commission's estimate is that the effect of its proposals would be that more than 400 Irish vessels would be scrapped. This represents 40% of the fishing fleet. This would have serious consequences for the fishing industry in Ireland and for the coastal communities dependent on fishing.The Commission's proposals were most recently discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 24 September. At Council I explained my opposition to this element of the Commission's proposals on the basis that it was a technocratic approach to fisheries management and would not ensure the sustainability of fish stocks which is the primary aim. I explained that Ireland could not support these measures which would force many family fishing enterprises in peripheral areas out of business. My position was supported by a number of other member states with whom I have been working to achieve agreement on a way forward. I am satisfied that all other member states and the Commission understand clearly the difficulties that the Commission's proposals on the fleet would create for the Irish fishing industry.Over the coming months I will continue to work with member states and the Commission to effect changes to the Commission's proposals which will ensure an appropriate balance between protecting the livelihoods of coastal communities and having in place effective measures to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	640	The Commission's proposals for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, include measures to strengthen control and enforcement. The measures include the establishment of a joint inspection structure at Community level, which will pool national means of inspection and surveillance and manage them within a Community framework. The Commission has indicated that establishment of a joint inspection structure will not change the distribution of existing responsibilities between the Commission and the member states in which the member states are primarily responsible for the control and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy.Ireland has for many years been at the forefront in pressing for a more efficient and effective control and enforcement regime under the Common Fisheries Policy and an even handed approach to the implementation of control and enforcement measures across the Community. As the waters around Ireland are rich fishing grounds where many fleets operate, the protection of fish stocks against illegal fishing activity is critical for the maintenance of Ireland's peripheral coastal communities, which are dependent on these fishing grounds. It is also critical that a level playing field applies across the Community so that fishermen have confidence in the system.I am, therefore, generally supportive of proposals to strengthen control and enforcement. However, there are a number of significant issues in relation to the Commission's proposals, including jurisdictional and sovereignty aspects, which must be examined in depth. I would not support measures that remove member states' responsibility within the respective exclusive economic zones. It is important to bear in mind that the feasibility and practicality of the Commission's proposals are still being examined at a technical and legal level and, accordingly, have not yet been debated in detail by Council. This examination is proceeding against the backdrop of differing legal systems prevailing in member states and also a number of other important and broader issues concerning respective competencies of member states and Community institutions. Accordingly, I am not in a position to give a definitive assessment of or response to the Commission's proposals at this juncture.

The Common Fisheries Policy provides for the conservation and rational exploitation of fisheries resources through a range of instruments, including through the determination of maximum annual catch levels, total allowable catch, TAC, and fleet management rules, multi annual guidance programme, MGP.TACs for the various fish stocks are established each year by the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers taking account of scientific advice provided by fisheries biologists on the state of stocks. The scientific advice is based on a precautionary approach whereby signposts are set giving information on the status of the stock in relation to predefined limits that should be avoided to ensure that stocks and their exploitation remain within safe biological limits. This precautionary approach ensures that where stocks are judged over exploited or at risk of depletion the TAC will be reduced to enable the stock to rebuild.In the recent past, the Community has put in place recovery plans in respect of cod in the Irish Sea, hake off the south of Ireland and cod off the west of Scotland in order to focus measures on the recovery of these stocks which are deemed to be at risk of depletion. These stocks are important to Ireland and the Irish industry has been involved in the preparation of the plans. The starting point for these recovery plans is a substantial reduction in the annual TAC. This is followed by conservation measures to protect spawning grounds and juveniles. The plans, which have received the full backing of the Irish fishing industry, should ensure that stocks are rebuilt over a medium timeframe.

Tara is Europe's largest zinc mine and has produced almost 55 million tonnes of ore to date. Current reserves and resources are estimated at about 45 million tonnes, not including over eight million tonnes in the Nevinstown part of the Navan ore body, acquired recently by Tara from the receiver of Bula Ltd.In recent years, however, the zinc market has been experiencing serious difficulties resulting in a decline in prices to levels not seen for 30 years. In the face of this and the high costs of the operation Tara's parent company, Outokumpu OYJ of Finland, decided, in November 2001, to temporarily close the mine and put it on a care and maintenance footing. The mine fully reopened on 16 September 2002 with a workforce of more than 650. Up to 28 employees are being recruited to replace retired workers and some who did not return following the temporary closure. A training programme for these is now under way. A total of 60,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrates is expected to be produced in 2002 rising to over 200,000 tonnes in 2003.Any recovery in the zinc sector will be subject to international forces but Tara has used its period of temporary closure to implement measures designed to reduce costs and increase productivity which will improve competitiveness. The cost of the improvement programme is estimated at between €15 and €20 million.

What principally differentiates 3G services from their current 2G counterparts is the greater capacity to handle data as well as voice services. Wireless Internet, audio on demand, video conferencing and traffic and travel information which is location specific will potentially be available on a 3G handset.The licensing of third generation mobile phone technology is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. In June 2002, the director announced that following a competitive selection process held during the year Hutchinson Whampoa, Vodafone and O2 had been offered licences to provide 3G services in Ireland. There were two types of licence to operate 3G in Ireland on offer. The A licence won by Hutchison Whampoa with a total fee of €50.7 million provides for 80% population coverage with minimum roll out requirements of 53% of the national population by the end of December 2005 and 80% coverage by the end of December 2007.

In these circumstances, it is appropriate that they pay dividends to their shareholders out of their profits.

An interim payment of €20 million based on the company's half yearly profits for 2002 was recently declared by the board. While the Commission for Energy Regulation allows reasonable returns in the regulated segment of the ESB's business, there is no direct link between the commissioner's recent decision and the ability of the company to pay dividends.

A key objective of this strategy is the putting in place of new models addressing interactions between relevant sectors, agencies and legal frameworks and delivering a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the management of coastal agencies.The development of the strategy for integrated coastal zone management will be taken forward in co-operation with the other public bodies concerned, will be informed by national and international experience and research to date and will take account of the EU recommendation on integrated coastal zone management published earlier this year. Account will be taken also of the ongoing work, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, on the implementation of the EU water framework directive, which is based on river basin management.

The MV Clipper Cheyenne is a semi-submersible float-in/float-out, heavy-lift/ro-ro dock ship. The purpose of the investigation is to ascertain, as far as is possible, the cause of the sinking of the ship. The ship sank while nearing the completion of the ballasting procedure to flood the ship's float-in/float-out cargo dock to load a dredger for transportation. The investigation is ongoing at present and it is being carried out in co-operation with the Bahamas maritime administration, the flag state for the vessel. The ship has now left Foynes and it is berthed in Cherbourg, France.The salvage agreement to refloat the MV Clipper Cheyenne and to prevent and clean up any pollution was between the salvors, underwriters and the Protection and Indemnity Club. The operation was commanded by the harbour master of the Shannon Foynes Port Company. The Coast Guard monitored the refloating and the pollution prevention and clean up operations undertaken by the salvors, to ensure that the environment was being safeguarded to the greatest possible extent. It is only if there is a difference of opinion as to the best way of serving the over-riding public interest that the Coast Guard will become more actively involved in salvage operations of this nature.The cost of the services provided by the Coast Guard, including the provision of pollution response equipment, was almost €138,000 and steps have been taken to recover this sum. The port company and others will be negotiating the recovery of their own costs.

In the case of Ireland, the administration of the .ie domain name was performed by UCD.Country code top level domain names can only be delegated to a national registry by ICANN, International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, with the approval of the national administration. ICANN is a not for profit, private sector company, which co-ordinates the policy development and operation of naming, addressing and related functions for the global Internet community.The IEDR, dot ie Domain Registry, is a private sector not for profit company. The company is in the process of having the responsibility for the domain name registry transferred from UCD. The management of the country code top level domain by a private sector company is common in many countries. Two typical examples are the USA and the UK.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	687	EU law prevents Governments in the member states, including Ireland, from intervening in relation to premium levels or the risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite. The pricing and underwriting of insurance are, therefore, the responsibility of individual insurance companies.Under the Agreed Programme for Government, we are committed to bringing about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market which we expect should lead to a reduction in insurance costs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I regret the announcement by the company that 104 jobs are to be lost due to restructuring of its operations.This is due to the fact that the market for its product has changed dramatically in the last 18 months whereby it has become far easier for low cost countries to compete. This shift in the market makes it increasingly difficult for the Killarney operation to remain competitive. The company's forecasts for the year ahead predict that there is no foreseeable pick up in the market for the basic, low cost product which has been in decline since last year. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, the company cannot continue to sustain current employment levels.IDA Ireland has advised that the restructured operation will now cater for the high value added market segment, which the company believes can be supplied on a profitable basis from Ireland. FÁS contacted the company on the day the announcement of redundancies was made. The full range of FÁS support services was offered to the employees. Following liaison between the FÁS employment services officer and the company, I understand that 58 of the staff have now registered with FÁS, of whom 33 are seeking training courses.

This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the single market. Once the relevant provisions of EU competition law are respected and single market rules adhered to, it is open to all companies to source their products anywhere within the EU. A sourcing obligation would, therefore, be contrary to EU rules.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The social economy programme aims to maximise the role of social economy enterprises in the regeneration of local economies within local disadvantaged areas, communities and within communities of interest experiencing disadvantage. The programme will be particularly targeted at disadvantaged communities and long-term unemployed persons.The objectives of the social economy programme are: to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to generate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; to promote equal opportunities between men and women.The purpose of the proposed high supports process is to provide appropriate supports to meet the needs of those people who because of age, literacy or other barriers are unlikely to succeed in getting, and keeping a job in the open labour market. The high supports process will build on the existing guidance and counselling services provided under the dual stranded national employment service to help people to become job ready.I anticipate that the high supports process will be launched by FÁS on a pilot basis in the near future.

EU law prevents any intervention from Governments in the member states, including Ireland, in relation to premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.On the specific question of the availability of insurance regardless of age, sex or marital status, the recent report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which has made a number of recommendations in that regard, has been referred to the Equality Authority.

The encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a far better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price controls. I urge consumers to be assertive in seeking explanations for price increases that they do not feel are justified.

This is 0.2% below the rate recorded in July and 4% lower than the annual rate of inflation for food products recorded for the same period last year. Food inflation is also well below the overall annual rate of inflation of 4.5%. These figures do not support assertions of excessive general levels of price increases in the food sector. I am committed to ensuring that  competition operates effectively in all sectors of the economy to the benefit of consumers.

However, I am confident, following my discussions with the IDA, that Cardinal Health continues to be strongly committed to the expansion of its business to Ireland. I have been assured by IDA Ireland that its commitment to the development of Longford remains solid and focused. In this regard, IDA Ireland has already initiated a process, over the past six months or so, to enhance its business park in Longford town. The agency is also committed to the establishment of a new business and technology park for the town comprising 30 to 40 acres. Both developments are well under way and, with the support of the local authority, a number of potential sites have been identified for the new business park. This park will be a flagship element of local infrastructure designed to attract new investment into Longford.

Many of the findings and a number of the recommendations of the MIAB, though concerned with motor insurance, have equal relevance to employer and public liability insurance.

At present, there are three overseas companies located in Tuam – Transitions Opticals, Pulse Engineering and Logstrup – with a combined employment of over 300 people. IDA Ireland has purchased a new 30 acre business park in the town. Site development work has progressed in the park, advance units have been designed and planning permission has been granted for a 25,000 sq. ft. new advance facility.Tuam's proximity to Galway as a successful regional hub further enhances the town's attractiveness for suitable clients and in this regard IDA Ireland will continue to develop and enhance the marketability of the town.

Each transfer application is examined by the military authorities having regard to factors such as the manpower level of the unit in which the applicant is serving, the number of transfer applications already on hand, the seniority of the applicant within the unit and the existence of a suitable vacancy in the unit to which the applicant wishes to transfer.The individual in question has been attached to 5 Field CIS Company, FCA, since 18 June 2000. In June 2002 he applied for a transfer from 28 Infantry Battalion to 5 Field CIS Company, FCA, in Sligo. Such transfers to the PDF cadre of FCA units have been suspended for some time pending the re-structuring of the Reserve Defence Force.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The person named applied for premium for 107 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an inspection of the herd it was found that one animal tag number XWVL0004K was not in the herdowner's ownership and possession at the time of application. This resulted in the animal being rejected from the claim with a consequent reduction penalty being applied to the remaining eligible animals. The person named was informed of the outcome and accepted this decision without appeal. He was paid his entitlement on 106 animals subject to a 0.94% reduction penalty on 24 July 2002.The person named was paid his full entitlements under the 2001 special beef premium scheme, 2001 slaughter premium scheme, 2001 ewe premium scheme, 2001 extensification premium scheme and 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	744	The long-term trend in on-farm employment is one of gradual decline. This is not unique to Ireland. The numbers of farmers have been in decline across EU and OECD countries as a whole for many years.The CSO's agricultural labour input survey shows that the number of farms has decreased from 161,700 in 1992 to 143,900 in 1999, the most recent year for which CSO data is available. This is a decrease of 17,800 farms or 11% in seven years, an average of approximately 2,550 farms per year. The decline has been most marked in the small farms category under 20 hectares where a 21% decrease was recorded. The average farm size has increased 13% from 26.0 hectares in 1991 to 29.3 hectares in 1999. There has been virtually no change in the number of farms over 20 hectares.The Government is fully committed to the preservation of the maximum viable number of both full and part-time farmers. In particular, this commitment was made clear in the agri-food 2010 plan of action published in August 2000.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	745	It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure Irish livestock or beef exporters have unrestricted access to world markets. Intensive efforts are being made by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to achieve this objective.It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of cattle or beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic contacts by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets. As an example, my Department, with the assistance of An Bord Bia, is this week hosting a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. I am pleased that the conference is being attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The decision by the Egyptian authorities to lift the ban on Irish beef imports was a welcome development for Irish cattle and beef sectors and I and my officials are working with the Egyptian authorities and the industry in general to regain our traditional position in that valuable market. In regard to the live trade, there has been a resumption in trade in younger animals to markets in the EU such as Spain and Italy. The trade in finished animals to Lebanon is also continuing since that market reopened to us following the lifting of FMD restrictions.On 11 March 2002, the EU scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare adopted a report on the welfare of animals – horses, pigs, sheep and cattle – during transport. The Commission is drafting a proposal for the amendment of Council Directive 91/628 on the welfare of animals during transport, which will include some of the recommendations stated in the report. The draft Commission proposal is not yet available to member states so I am not in a position to give a conclusive opinion upon it. However, live exports are a vital component of the Irish livestock trade. I have always insisted on the stringent application of the existing controls rather than the imposition of further restrictions on journey times and controls that are difficult to apply. I will continue to support measures which facilitate live exports in a manner which ensures the welfare of animals.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	746	I am not aware that the farming organisations have made any demand for the early introduction of the dairy cow premium in 2002. The dairy cow premium was part of a package of measures negotiated under Agenda 2000 and was the mechanism agreed to compensate farmers, by means of direct payment, for the planned reduction of 15% in the intervention price, to be implemented in three equal steps in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The first phase of the dairy cow premium is due to be paid in 2005 to coincide with the first phase of the price reduction.Any change in the phasing of payments would require a proposal from the EU Commission and agreement in the Council of Ministers. Given the linkage between the dairy cow premium and the intervention price reduction, I do not expect the Commission would seek to bring forward the compensation element alone.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 311 together.The intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder are set down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/99 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products. The current intervention price levels are those agreed as part of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. This envisaged a reduction in support prices commencing in 2005, to coincide with the introduction of a dairy cow premium as part compensation for the price reduction. Any change in the intervention price would require a proposal from the EU Commission and agreement in the Council of Ministers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	748	I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 298 and 310 together.The major factors in determining price levels are the availability of and ease of access to markets, the returns from those markets and, in addition, in the case of third countries, the level of export refunds. Other factors involved include efficiency at processing level and the extent to which value is added to the primary product.As far as beef is concerned, the EU market has recovered well from the last BSE crisis. The destocking of cattle arising from the FMD outbreak last year has resulted in a substantial reduction in beef production in the United Kingdom. These developments have created additional opportunities for Irish beef exporters. With regard to the third country markets, the EU Commission increased export refunds on 27 September last by up to 30% for Egypt, following my strong representations to Commissioner Fischler. This new special high rate of export refund will make Irish beef more competitive on the Egyptian market and should lead to the resumption of trade to a very important traditional market at a crucial time in the cattle disposal season. With regard to other third country markets, the decision by the Russian Government to lift restrictions on the six county BSE ban was also made following contacts between the Irish and Russian authorities and will substantially improve access to that market for Irish beef. I expect exports to Russia to reach 75,000 tonnes this year compared to 43,000 tonnes last year.Intensive efforts are ongoing with the Gulf region, the Philippines and Indonesia to have those markets re-opened to imports of Irish beef. Of particular interest is the fact that this week my Department is hosting a visit by technical experts from six Gulf states who are looking at food safety and consumer protection issues in relation to Irish beef.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	749	Since February 2000, my Department has published on a weekly basis, prices paid by individual named meat plants for all grades and categories of cattle. This initiative introduced a new degree of price transparency into the market which has been extremely useful to farmers in their decisions relating to the disposal of their stock.As far as market price transparency is concerned, my Department endeavoured over a lengthy period in 1999 and 2000, through the monitoring committee on the report of the beef task force, to secure the agreement of all of the interests in the beef industry to a voluntary price transparency mechanism. While substantial progress was made on a price transparency model, the industry was unable to reach agreement on the issue of independent verification.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	750	As far as payment of compliance costs to farmers is concerned, I am bound by the EU provisions on state aids as to what can be achieved in that regard but I am committed to ensuring that such costs are kept to a minimum. My Department's payment system is one of the most efficient in the European Union. Notwithstanding this, application procedures continue to be subject to review with a view to simplification, subject to EU accountability requirements.I am aware of the difficulties faced by some in completing the paperwork required under many of the schemes and as part of this ongoing review process a protocol on direct payments was agreed with farming organisations in 2000. This has been carried forward into my Department's Customer Service Action Plan 2001-2004, which includes commitments to the use of clear and comprehensible language in forms and information leaflets, the establishment of regional customer panels and the development of electronic data to reduce form filling.Payments to farmers under the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, are calculated to cover the additional costs and reductions in income that arise when a farmer follows the more extensive and environmentally friendly farming practices that participation in the scheme requires. In April this year I announced some improvements in the early retirement scheme and I am currently considering some changes in the operational requirements of REPS. However, REPS and the scheme of early retirement from farming are two of the four measures included in Ireland's CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, which was approved by the EU Commission. The plan also incorporates the compensatory allowances and forestry measures. Any changes in those conditions of the schemes that are included in the rural development plan would require formal amendment of the plan at EU level.Subject to EU requirements and in consultation with its customers, my Department will continue to simplify forms and application procedures generally.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The premiums paid to beef producers are part of the common organisation of the market for beef and veal. The current arrangements for these premiums were agreed as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement, which provided for the introduction of new premiums and an increase in the existing premiums over a three year period from 2000 to 2002 in return for a 20% reduction in institutional prices over the same period. There are no proposals for these prices to be index linked.As a result of this agreement, the maximum premiums payable on steers submitted for the special beef premium this year are €270 higher than in 1999. This is equivalent to an increase of 27c/lb for all steers slaughtered in Ireland. The increase in the premiums payable on suckler cows amounted to €171 per head. In addition, part of the national envelope, worth €20 million per annum, has been used to top up the suckler cow premium in respect of replacement suckler cows and up to 15% of dry heifers submitted for the suckler cow premium. Premiums were introduced for heifers for the first time under Agenda 2000 through the slaughter premium which is worth €80 per head this year. In addition, one third of the national envelope amounting to approximately €10 million is used to top up the slaughter premium on beef heifers bringing the total premium on beef heifers to over €100 per head this year. Furthermore, the payments of the compensatory allowances in the disadvantaged areas were €25 million higher this year than in 1999.The value of these premiums has to be seen in the context of developments in cattle prices over the last three years. Current steer prices, at 234c/kg or 84p/lb, are broadly at the same level as in late September 1999.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	752	I propose to take Questions Nos. 242, 295 and 322 together.The present area based compensatory allowance scheme replaced the old cattle, sheep, equine and goat headage schemes with effect from 2001. Under the 2001 scheme, a total of €235 million was paid to approximately 99,000 farmers compared to €144 million paid to 92,000 farmers under the 2000 animal based schemes. This additional expenditure of €91 million annually represents a major boost to farmers' incomes in the 75% of the country classified as disadvantaged.The area based scheme was modified in 2002 by increasing the rate payable on mountain type land. That increase was backdated to 2001 with farmers being paid €16 million earlier this year by way of a top up on the 2001 scheme. The scheme now provides for area based payments as follows: mountain type land –€101.58 on first ten hectares or part thereof and €88.88 per hectare on remaining hectares subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares; more severely handicapped lowland –€88.88 per hectare on up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland –€76.18 per hectare on up to 45 hectares. Where a farmer farms a combination of the above lands he is paid on mountain type land first, lowland more severely handicapped second and lowland less severely handicapped last, subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares.Payments under the scheme in 2002 commenced on Friday, 20 September 2002 ahead of the target date for payment agreed in the Protocol on direct payments to farmers. In the first week a record total of almost €192 million, including €4.5 million under the compensation package, issued to over 84,000 farmers. The payments now being made represent 100% entitlement for 2002. While there is a minority of farmers who would stand to lose money under the revised scheme when compared to the old animal based headage schemes, the compensation element agreed as part of the original area based scheme continues to apply. Under this arrangement farmers who lost out in 2001 received compensation of 90% of their loss. The compensation element has reduced to 80% this year and the payments now being made include this element of compensation for losses in appropriate cases.The Government is committed, in the agreed programme for Government, to examine, in conjunction with the Commission, the possibility of extending the disadvantaged areas classification to the whole of the Border, midland and western region. The issue will be raised with the Commission in the context of the mid-term review of the CAP rural development plan.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, is one of the four measures included in Ireland's CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006 which was approved by the EU Commission. Any changes in those conditions of REPS that are included in the rural development plan would require formal amendments at EU level.It is my intention shortly to put in motion a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	754	The farming sector in north County Dublin is comprised mainly of horticulture, potato and grain production. My Department devotes significant national and community resources to assist these sectors.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, there are separate schemes of investment aid in the commercial horticulture, potato and grain sectors to which over €34 million has been allocated over that period. Some 359 projects have been approved under the first round of these schemes, which have now concluded, of which 53, involving aid of €3.2 million, are in north County Dublin. Also, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department operates a capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, which includes horticultural, potato and grain among other agricultural products. A total of €25 million has been allocated over the duration of this scheme. Grant aid was awarded to 14 projects in these sectors in the first round of the scheme, of which five were in north County Dublin and involved grant aid of just over €1 million.

The scheme makes provision for the processing of applications in joint names.
Questions Nos. 248 and 249 answered with Question No. 232.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system.A stocking density of 1.5960 livestock units per hectare for the holding was established based on the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by the herdowner on CEN.1 and 2 forms at all five census dates. Where the stocking density of a holding is less than 1.6 livestock units per hectare, premium is paid at the rate of €66.00 per qualifying animal.Under EU regulations, however, at pre-payment stage the Department is obliged to carry out a stocking density cross check against the Department's cattle movement and monitoring system, CMMS. For the purposes of carrying out the cross check in this case, the numbers of bovine animals declared by the person named at one of the five census dates were substituted with the numbers found to have been present on the holding at that same date according to CMMS and the stocking density recalculated. When recalculated, the stocking density of the holding increased to 1.6086 livestock units per hectare. Where stocking densities of between 1.60 and 2.0 livestock units per hectare are established, premium is paid at the rate of €33.00 per qualifying animal.On 15 August 2002 an extensification premium grant amounting to €1,650 was paid to the person named.

Commission Regulation 1900/2000 provided for an across the board application of a 0.8 co-efficient to the livestock unit value of bovine animals declared by herdowners on their CEN.1 forms in respect of the first and second census dates in 2001. Thus a co-efficient was applied in this case at the first and second census dates.The regulation also provided for the granting of the co-efficient in cases where herds are totally restricted under TB or brucellosis regulations on a census date. Should a census date fall within a 20 calendar day period immediately following de-restriction, the co-efficient may be granted for that date also. The herd was restricted under brucellosis regulations from 21 May to 26 October 2001 and a 0.8 co-efficient was applied to the livestock unit value of the bovine animals declared as present in the herd at the third and fourth census dates. Since the herd was de-restricted on 26 October 2001, the 20 day period as referred to will not allow for the granting of a co-efficient at the fifth census date of 18 November 2001.Notwithstanding the granting of the 0.8 co-efficient at four of the five census dates, a stocking density of 2.0164 livestock units per hectare was established in this case which is based on the numbers of bovine animals the person named declared as being present in his herd at all five census dates for 2001. I regret that the relevant EU regulation does not allow payment of 2001 extensification premium where the stocking density of a holding is greater than 2.0 livestock units per hectare.The person named was paid his full entitlement under the 2001 special beef premium scheme.

The herd was selected for a field inspection which was carried out on 20 May 2002.At the inspection the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months found to have been present in the herd at all five census dates in 2001 were such that the stocking density when calculated amounted to 1.753 livestock units per hectare. Under the census system, where the stocking density of a holding is found to be between 1.60 and 2.0 livestock units per hectare, payment may only issue at the lower payment rate of €33.00 per qualifying animal.On 8 June 2002, a payable order for €330.00 issued which represented payment of extensification premium on ten animals that had already qualified for payment under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. On 11 July 2002, a payable order for €6,864.00 issued which represented payment of extensification premium on 208 male animals that had already qualified for payment under the 2001 special beef premium. The person named was paid his full entitlement under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, the 2001 special beef premium scheme, 2001 slaughter premium scheme and the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme.

However, my Department received no written confirmation from him of any repayment schedule, and as a result it was necessary to continue the recoupment of the outstanding debt from payments to which he would have been entitled under other schemes. The balance now outstanding is €3,049.35.No interest has been added to the debt since the person named first indicated to my Department in June 2001 that he was prepared to agree a schedule of repayments. My officials will now write to him directly and endeavour to make an agreement with him to recover the balance of the debt over a period that is suitable to his circumstances. In the meantime, no further recoupments will be made from payments due to him under other schemes.

This property was sold subject to existing turbary rights in favour of other parties and in accordance with the provisions of section 8 of the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992. It was advertised for sale by my Department in a local newspaper in February 2000 and interested parties were subsequently invited to tender for the land. I have arranged to write to the Deputy giving the name of the purchaser and the purchase price. When land is sold by my Department, it may be sold subject, inter alia, to turbary rights. These rights may appear as a burden on the folio for the lands sold. The interests of the various parties in, on or over the land are protected by both statute and common law. Disputes arising between the various interest holders are matters for resolution between the parties either by negotiation or by way of application to court. Disputes are not a matter for my Department to resolve.Folio number 39642F County Mayo mentioned in parliamentary questions 16340/02 and 16312/02 does not relate to land in the townland of Corlee.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The person named applied on seven cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on 29 June 2001. Two of the cows applied on were not registered on the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, as having calved at any time and one of the cows was slaughtered within the six months retention period of the scheme and was not replaced as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme. He was informed on 8 February 2002 that no payment could therefore be made under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme as he had contravened clause 26 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The person named requested a review of this decision on 8 March 2002. My Department asked for further information regarding the calving dates for the two animals on 9 April 2002 and based on the reply dated 27 June 2002 it was decided to accept one of the two animals as a heifer and to delete the second animal from the application since no independent evidence was provided that it had ever calved. He was advised on 5 July 2002 that his application would be processed further on the basis on five cows and one heifer submitted for premium. As he disposed of one cow during the retention period, with no eligible replacement, a reduction penalty would apply to the grants due on his remaining five eligible animals, i.e. four cows and one heifer. However, when his application was subsequently cross-checked against the CMMS it was found that the heifer had also been slaughtered within the six months retention period with no eligible replacement for this animal.My Department advised the person named on 9 September 2002 that two animals were now rejected from his application and that a reduction penalty would apply to the grants due on the remaining four eligible cows. The person named confirmed that he accepted this penalty. Payment of his 100% entitlement under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, amounting to €549.77, issued to him on 12 September 2002; as did payment of €7.15 under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme euro compensation.

At an inspection of his herd on 5 September 2001 four of the animals applied on were absent and he was advised that as he had contravened the terms and conditions of the scheme no grants were payable to him. The person named subsequently advised my Department that the four animals died between 1 and 20 October 2001 and were disposed of at a local knackery. My Department wrote to the person named on 12 February 2002 advising him that as  he had failed to establish that the cows were in his herd at the date of application he was not entitled to payment under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. The person named wrote to my Department on 6 June 2002 stating that the four cows had actually been buried on his own land.As there is no record of a burial licence having issued from my Department in respect of these cows nor any notification of their deaths to the cattle movement monitoring system's database, the person named was informed that he was not entitled to any grants under the 2001 scheme. He was advised that he could appeal this decision to the agriculture appeals office and an appeal from him was received at that office on 23 September 2002.

The delay in progressing this case is mainly due to the complexities involved in the rectification of this title. Some 45 parties are involved in this transaction and a number of people have yet to sign rectification forms relating to this title before the transaction can be completed. All necessary steps are been taken with a view to expediting the completion of the schedule in question.

According to the terms and conditions of the scheme, producers must submit an area aid application if they wish to be paid premium on animals in excess of 15 livestock units. As there is no record of a 2001 area aid application being submitted by the herdowner and as he has already been paid special beef premium on 5.4 livestock units, his suckler cow premium payment has been limited to 9.6 livestock units comprising of two heifers under two years and 8.4 cows. He has been paid his full entitlement on 10.4 animals. An advance payment issued on 24 October 2001 with a balancing payment on 5 February 2002.Though the person named opted to participate in 2001 extensification premium under the census system, the question of payment cannot be considered because he did not submit an area aid application in 2001.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system. When herdowners were notified by letter of the third census date for 2001 extensification premium, they were requested to return their completed CEN.1 forms to the Department by Friday, 5 October 2001. The CEN.1 form catered for the first three of five census dates in 2001 while the CEN.2 catered for the remaining two. In November 2001 the Department wrote to those herdowners who at that stage had still not returned their CEN.1 forms giving them a final opportunity to do so. The letter advised that, if still interested in 2001 extensification premium, herdowners must lodge their outstanding forms by Friday, 14 December 2001.The relevant EU regulation requires that on-farm checks must be carried out on 10% of herdowners participating. The purpose of these checks is to establish whether discrepancies exist between animal numbers as declared on CEN.1 and 2 forms vis-à-vis what was actually found to have been present on holdings on the census dates checked. Cases are selected for on-farm checks using a risk analysis process that is structured on declarations made by herdowners on their CEN.1 and CEN.2 forms. Where the CEN.1 and-or CEN.2 form is not returned to the Department, the case simply cannot be selected for any check because there are no declarations made on which the check itself can be compared against.

These include the following: I obtained a derogation from the EU Commission to allow set-aside land to be used for animal feed purposes on farms where 33% or more of the land has been flooded; I arranged for Teagasc to provide an intensive advisory service, both general and one to one; in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, I arranged that the farm assist scheme take account of the situation faced by farmers; I obtained EU Commission approval to bring forward the payment of 50% of arable aid due to cereal farmers to 16 October; and I obtained an increase in the rate of advance payments made on cattle premia from 60% to 80% with effect from 16 October.I have also put great emphasis on improving market supports. Over the summer period I succeeded in strengthening the market supports system within the milk sector aimed at addressing the market weakness which prevailed at the time. Furthermore, I recently announced a substantial improvement in the beef export refund rate for Egypt, aimed at the specific requirements for that market. In this context I have no plans to introduce a national aid scheme.

As part of this process, my Department has engaged in an extensive consultative process.Having received submissions from a number of interested parties and having had a number of follow-up meetings which had been requested by some of the parties, my Department is finalising proposals for prospective changes to the relevant legislation so as to take account of the recommendations of the IMB and, in so far as possible, the views expressed by interested parties.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	798	I propose to take Questions Nos. 294 and 321 together.I remain fully committed to the principles of the national sheep identification system, NSIS, introduced in June 2001, which provides the means by which each individual animal in the national flock can be identified and traced from birth to carcass, with ensuing benefits in areas such as disease monitoring/control, consumer assurance, flock management, etc. Based on its own monitoring, my Department believes that all aspects of the NSIS, including the register are generally working well.In launching NSIS, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has invested major effort in equipping flockowners with information and guidance on all aspects of its operation. My Department continues to assist flockowners in this regard, via the NSIS help-line and in other respects. Notwithstanding this, it has been made clear from the very outset that it is open to examining any specific difficulties which flockowners might encounter in the operation of NSIS, with a view to resolving such difficulties within the key parameters of the system. In this context my Department has examined a number of concerns expressed by flockowners relating to particular aspects, most notably the reconciliation component, of NSIS. Adjustments in a number of areas can be considered which will address these concerns in a manner which maintains the integrity of both the identification and traceability dimensions of NSIS.

Because of foot and mouth disease, control measures relating to the movement of animals were in place during the early part of 2001, Commission Regulation 1900/2000 provided for an across-the-board application of a 0.8 co-efficient to the livestock unit value of bovine animals declared by herdowners on their CEN.1 form in respect of the first and second census dates in 2001. In the case of the person named, the coefficient was applied to the livestock unit value of the animals declared at the first and second census dates.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	808	It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish beef exporters have unrestricted access to whatever markets with which they wish to trade. All markets are important to our exporters in so far as having the maximum number of outlets for our products throughout the world can only be positive for the sector as a whole. Intensive efforts at diplomatic, political and technical levels are made by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to bring about this objective.It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic contacts by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.My Department, with the assistance of An Bord Bia, is this week hosting a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region and I am pleased that the conference is being attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.We are also in contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	809	Arrangements are in place to ensure full traceability of beef at all stages of production and marketing, up to and including the final point of sale to the retail consumer. These measures include the following beef labelling requirements: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to an animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; the  approval number of the de-boning hall and member state or third country in which it is located; the member state or third country where the animal was born was fattened and was slaughtered.As regards the extension of similar detailed labelling rules to sales of food products through the catering and food service sector, I have asked that this be among the areas to be considered by a committee which I have recently established to examine food labelling in general. This committee, which is chaired by Mr. Ned Sullivan and is broadly representative of food industry and consumer interests, is due to report by the end of the year.With regard to the importation of de-boned fresh beef, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products of UK origin, products must be sourced under the EU approved date-based export scheme and approved premises in the UK, and from bovines under the export certified herd scheme in Northern Ireland.Products of foreign origin coming from the UK must comply with special marking and labelling conditions and be sourced from designated slaughter plants and processing premises. All such products must be processed in export approved premises, XAP, and only such goods may be dispatched from the UK from officially approved establishments.To minimise any risks that might be associated with trade with third countries in food products, strict rules governing the importation of animal products from non-EU countries have been put in place at EU level. In particular, the EU Commission must approve the country of origin and the establishment in which the product was produced in advance of importation. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the animal health status of the country, the adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production plants are inspected by veterinary experts from the food and veterinary office of the European Commission.On arrival in the EU, a third country product is subject to official inspection at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents, on identity and labelling and random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order importation is authorised and thereafter the product may circulate freely. Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, is one of the four measures included in Ireland's CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, which was approved by the EU Commission. Any changes in the conditions of REPS that are included in the rural development plan would require formal amendment of the plan at EU level.It is my intention shortly to put in motion a consultative process about REPS involving a wide range of stakeholders, leading into the mid-term review of the rural development plan in 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the EU Commission in 2003 are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	812	Over recent years my Department, in consultation with the farm bodies and with progressive use of information technology, has made major progress in simplifying the application procedure under the various schemes. The changes introduced include: pre-printing of personal details, name, address and herdnumber and in the case of area aid, land parcel identification numbers, on application forms; use of bar-coding on bovine animal passports – no need in most cases to list tagnumbers on applications; Provision of "CMMS herd profiles" to assist farmers in completing extensification census forms; automatic processing of entitlement to slaughter premium without the need for farmers to submit an application; and the removal of certain notification requirements – such information is now taken from the database.In addition to the above, the move in 2001 from an animal based system for payment of disadvantaged areas' compensatory allowance to an area based system has greatly facilitated simplification of the application procedure.Information technology and CMMS have therefore been used to significantly simplify the application, administration, inspection and payment procedures. In general all of our application forms consist of one A4 personalised page with pre-printed details provided where possible. Because of increased use of CMMS the number of on-farm inspections to be carried out under the bovine schemes has been reduced by over 50% with effect from this year. The CMMS is being used to make payment under the slaughter premium scheme without the need for individual applications. Profiles from the CMMS are being issued to farmers to assist them in completing census forms for the extensification premium scheme. As the CMMS becomes more accurate we will be able to dispense with individual census forms and use the CMMS data for determining entitlement to extensification premium. This aspect is currently being examined for the 2003 extensification premium scheme.

A working group was subsequently established to examine appropriate changes to the control requirements with a view to ensuring a greater degree of simplification and proportionality. That examination was concluded in November 2001 and a new regulation was published in December 2001 which was effective from 1 January 2002.The following changes have been introduced: a farm-based approach to bovine livestock inspections leading to a reduction of over 50% in the number of on-farm inspections; reduced penalties for late lodgement of an area aid application involving permanent pasture; a producer may lodge an application up to 1 July with 0.5% percent penalty per working day late after the closing date; no penalty for overdeclaration of forage area where there is sufficient area to support the stocking density for the livestock schemes concerned; non-compliance with passports or bovine herd register is not penalised at a first inspection and only has the effect of flagging the herd for a second inspection within 24 months; the concept of false declaration through serious negligence has been abolished; and a fairer approach to adjusting payments has been introduced where there is non-compliance.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	817	In submitting its proposals for the early retirement scheme to the EU Commission, my Department had made provision for annual increases in the rate of pension. However, the Commission advised that the relevant regulations required a fixed rate be set and this is reflected in the scheme as approved.The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. That regulation does not provide for indexation of payments.It is a requirement of the EU regulations governing both the 1994 and the current schemes of early retirement from farming that the early retirement pension can be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension that is payable. This means that the amount of national retirement pension payable to a participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, must be deducted from the early retirement pension.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	818	A total of 10,450 applications were received under the first scheme of early retirement from farming which closed to new applications at the end of 1999. To date, 1,366 applications have been received under the current scheme which commenced in November 2000. Of these 1,166 have been approved for payment; 54 have been refused; 140 are currently being processed and six were withdrawn. A significant number of the applications that were refused may yet be successful if the deficiencies identified in them are rectified.The following is a breakdown on a county basis of applications under the two schemes:
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	819	It is a requirement of the EU regulations governing both the 1994 and the current schemes of early retirement from farming that the early retirement pension can be paid only as a supplement to any national retirement pension that is payable. This means that the amount of national retirement pension payable to a participant, and to his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, must be deducted from the early retirement pension.On entering the early retirement scheme, participants undertake to cease commercial farming definitively. Even in a case where payment may have ceased because the amount of the national retirement pension is greater than the early retirement pension, the participant may not resume farming. Farming transferees, too, undertake to practise farming as a main occupation and work the expanded holding for as long as the pension is granted to the retiring farmer, and they must continue to comply with their undertakings regardless of whether the pension continues to be paid.These undertakings are clearly set out in the scheme documentation and are in compliance with EU regulations, and my Department has no authority to vary them.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I introduced a scheme for the distribution of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota among certain producers. Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply.A large volume of applications was received under this scheme and considerable progress has been made towards the finalisation of allocations. An application was received from the person named. My Department will not be in a position to confirm whether individual applications are acceptable until a full assessment of the accompanying documentation in all cases has been conducted. The amount of quota to be allocated to any eligible applicant can be determined only when all eligible applications have been processed. Allocations made under this scheme may be used to cover milk delivered during the 2002-03 quota year.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The person named included a land parcel on his 2001 area aid application to which he was not entitled. He claimed a total of 15.46 hectares but was entitled to claim only 13.82 hectares. This resulted in an overclaim of 1.64 hectares or 11%.Under the EU regulations, no penalty is applied when the overclaim is less than 3%. The penalty is based on double the difference when the overclaim is between 3% and 20%. Therefore in this instance, an area aid penalty of double the difference between the area found and the area claimed must be applied leaving an area determined for payment purposes of 10.54 hectares.Payments due under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme, 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, 2001 special beef premium scheme and 2001 extensification premium based on 10.54 hectares will issue shortly.The 2002 area aid application of the person named was fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 18.66 hectares. The person named was paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 27 September 2002. Payments under the 2002 premia schemes are not due to commence until 16 October 2002.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	823	Following an inspection by my Department on 20 February 2002, a penalty was imposed on the person named for the removal of a hedgerow. The REP scheme conditions define any hedgerow, stonewall or field boundary as a habitat and require that it be retained. Where such a feature is found to have been removed, those conditions also specify that a 100% penalty shall be applied to the person's annual REPS payment. My Department has no discretion as to the level of penalty to be imposed since REPS includes a schedule of penalties for specific breaches of the scheme conditions.The proposed penalty was notified to the person named on 25 February and she was informed of her right of appeal to my Department's local office. No appeal was received within the time limit specified, and the penalty was therefore applied. An appeal was received subsequently and has been lodged for consideration by my Department's REPS appeals committee. The case is being investigated and will be presented to the appeals committee for a final decision at the earliest possible opportunity. The person named will be notified directly of the outcome by my Department.

Herdowners were notified by individual letter of each of the five census dates for 2001. When notified of the third census date, the notification letter requested herdowners to return their completed CEN.1 forms to the Department by Friday, 5 October 2001. The CEN.1 form catered for the first three of five census dates while the CEN.2 catered for the remaining two. When notified of the fifth date, herdowners were requested to return their completed CEN.2 forms by Friday, 18 January 2002. Some weeks after the passing of the respective closing dates, those herdowners who had still not returned their CEN.1 and-or CEN.2 forms were issued with reminder letters giving them a final opportunity to do so. The Department continued to accept census forms lodged up to Friday, 17 May 2002.The person named did not return his CEN.1 or CEN.2 forms to the Department. The relevant EU regulation requires that on-farm checks must be carried out on 10% of herdowners who participate in extensification premium. The purpose of these checks is to establish whether discrepancies exist between animal numbers as declared on CEN.1 and 2 forms vis-à-vis what was actually found to have been present on holdings on the census dates checked. Cases are selected for on-farm checks using a risk analysis process that is structured on animal number declarations made by herdowners on the census CEN.1 and 2 forms. Where CEN.1 and-or CEN.2 forms are not returned to the Department, the case simply cannot be selected for any check because there are no declarations made on which the check itself can be compared against.In view of the events as outlined, I regret the person named cannot be considered for payment of extensification premium for 2001. The person named was paid his full entitlements under the 2001 suckler cow premium, 2001 ewe premium and the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance schemes.

Because of the late receipt of the form it was necessary to arrange for an on-farm check to be carried out. This check was carried out on 26 September 2002 and matters were found to have been satisfactory.Arrangements are in place to pay 2001 extensification premium to the person named. He can expect two payable orders amounting to €858.00 shortly.

The maximum destocking that will be applied for 2003 is 50%, subject to the polluter pays principle.I will shortly be announcing details of an appeals mechanism in relation to commonage framework plans. Shareholders may appeal the destocking percentage specified for their commonage. If it is decided that a change is warranted this will be on the basis of an environmental assessment of the condition of the land. If an adjustment is made to the destocking percentage for a commonage this will apply to all shareholders. It is not possible to alter the destocking requirement for individual shareholders.

Under the terms and conditions of the suckler cow premium scheme, it is necessary to carry out detailed checks regarding the identification and registration of animals to ensure compliance with traceability requirements as provided for under EU regulations.My Department carried out an inspection of the herd of the person named on 28 September 2001 and it was found that 11 calves did not have cattle identity cards as their births were not registered on the national calf birth registration service database and two animals presented for inspection had no eartags. As the person named had contravened the terms and conditions of the scheme he was advised in writing by the inspecting officer that no grants were due to him under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. My Department wrote to the person named again on 18 February 2002 confirming that no payments were due to him under the scheme. He was given 21 days to appeal this decision. To date, no reply has been received from him.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I propose to take Questions Nos. 360 and 361 together.The development of a common unified animal health strategy for the island of Ireland is an objective of the North-South Ministerial Council. To date a considerable amount of progress has been made towards achieving this objective. Advances have been made on a number of specific initiatives concerning controls and policies at the point of import onto the island of Ireland and regarding the development of common guidelines for those involved in agriculture on bio-security measures and scrapie. In addition, a comprehensive review has been conducted on the scope for convergence of animal health policies and a timetable has been agreed for action to achieve convergence. Side by side with these developments, the extent of contact, co-operation and co-ordination between the northern and southern administrations has intensified both at political and official level.A number of working groups have been established under the aegis of the North-South Ministerial Council to carry forward the detailed work in regard to animal identification and traceability, cross Border fraud, disease surveillance, import and export policies, TSEs and other animal diseases, animal welfare and veterinary medicines.Complete alignment of policies is contingent on certain external factors including the attitude of the European Union, the development of complementary strategies within Great Britain and further developments in regard to BSE. In this connection, at its most recent meeting on 27 September last, the Council instructed that officials should seek to finalise discussions with the authorities in Great Britain prior to final agreement of the strategy by the North-South Ministerial Council at the end of the year.The development of an all Ireland animal health strategy includes the adoption of a unified or complementary approach towards disease surveillance and disease prevention and control, including contingency plans for the prevention and control of any future outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. In so far as sheep scrapie is concerned, the European Union is tabling proposals for scrapie genotyping and control and this will provide the framework for North-South convergence.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The circumstances surrounding the labelling of queen potatoes in a supermarket was a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs as that office has the responsibility for labelling, presentation and advertising of pre-packaged foodstuffs under EU Directive 2000/13/EC. Section 4 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 also makes it an offence to apply a false trade description in the course of any trade, business or profession.On foot of a complaint from the IFA, officials of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs met with representatives of the IFA on 23 August 2002 when the ODCA's position in relation to the applicability of EU Directive 2000/13/EC and section 4 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, in relation to new potatoes, was fully explained to the IFA delegation.The Director of Consumer Affairs considers that no action is necessary in this case. The packer who supplied the supermarket in question was allocated a grant under the capital investment scheme for marketing and processing of certain agricultural products in 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 364 together.Under the capital investment scheme operated by my Department for the marketing and processing of certain agricultural products grant assistance is provided towards capital projects in the eggs, livestock, horticulture, grain and potato sectors which do not fall within the remit of the development agencies or are not covered by my Department's on-farm schemes. The guidelines for the scheme, including sectoral priorities and eligibility criteria, are set out in the scheme document which was provided to applicants at application stage.The scheme document sets out the following broad sectoral priorities for the potato sector. The objective of the scheme is to speed up improvements in the marketing infrastructure of the potato sector by providing grant assistance towards the capital cost of facilities for the storage, handling and marketing of seed and ware potatoes. Grant aid is geared towards: construction of new storage and handling buildings; upgrading of existing storage and handling buildings, including provision of ventilation and insulation; acquisition-installation of storage-related equipment; and acquisition-installation of marketing equipment, for example, for grading, brushing, washing, packing, weighing, labelling, handling.The marketing equipment listed was given as an example of the type of equipment which could attract grant aid and is not an exhaustive list. As the aim of the scheme is to encourage marketing and processing, it is open to my Department to fund items of equipment other than those given as examples if they contribute to the development of the sector.My Department received 24 eligible applications in the potato sector seeking grant aid in the region of €10 million. As all of the applications met the broad sectoral priorities set out, and in order to allocate the limited available funding, it was necessary to assess, evaluate and prioritise the applications received. The applications were evaluated by reference to viability, target markets, their sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they would improve the saleability of the primary product. Following the assessment process, six projects were approved for the award of grant aid.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	850	The animal movement control arrangements put into place during last year's foot and mouth emergency have been largely dismantled. However, certain provisions in relation to cattle and sheep have been retained in an ongoing effort to slow down animal movement and to avoid the dispersal of disease through animal movement and contact.  The principal trigger for spread of disease is deemed to be animal movement, particularly continuous movement such as through dealers' premises or movement involving multiple source contacts or destinations such as through marts. Thus, the measures now in place are focused on these higher risk areas. They comprise a limit on the number of sales that may take place of an animal within a 30 day period where there has been a dealer involvement. In addition, a permitting arrangement for the movement of cattle from farm to farm continues to apply.Apart from the foregoing, dealers must be registered and must maintain records of transactions, etc. and systems of identification and traceability of sheep and pigs have been introduced under the NSIS, national sheep identification system, and NPITS, the national pig identification and tracing system, respectively.

To qualify for premium the animal must be more than eight months of age and must have been held by the producers for a period of two months of the last three months of the animal's life. Payment of the slaughtering premium is related to the Department's cattle movement monitoring system, which records information on cattle registration, movements and slaughter-export.The person named will be paid in respect of 27 animals that have met the requirements of the scheme. Advance payment on these animals will commence on 16 October 2002.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	866	The person named included a parcel of land on his 2002 area aid application that relates to a commonage on which an overclaim has been determined. All 19 herdowners on this commonage have been written to with a view to resolving this overclaim. Until this matter is resolved the area aid application for the person named cannot be fully processed and no area related payments can issue.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	867	The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system. Based on the numbers of bovine animals over the age of six months declared by the herdowner as being present on his holding at each of the five census dates, the stocking density of the holding was 2.0143 livestock unit per hectare. The calculations were based on the full forage area of 48.63 hectares declared by the herdowner on his 2001 area aid application form. Even in a case where a greater area for a holding is established than that declared, EU regulations do not allow the greater area to be accepted for payment purposes.Under the terms of the relevant EU regulation, extensification premium may only be paid where the stocking density of a holding does not exceed 2.0 livestock units per hectare. The person named has been paid in full in respect of 38 animals applied on under the special beef premium scheme, 2001.The person named was paid his full entitlement under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	868	I introduced a scheme for the distribution of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota among certain producers. Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	869	The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and its successor introduced in November 2000 are both governed by EU Council regulations. It is a requirement of these regulations that the early retirement pension may only be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension payable. This means that any national retirement pension payable to a participant in the scheme must be deducted from his or her early retirement pension.The overpayment for the person named, amounting to €163.48, arose from the concurrent payment to her of non-contributory old age pension and the full amount of early retirement pension. My Department is obliged to recover all overpayments under the scheme, as failure to do so would jeopardise its obligations with regard to EU funds. However, my Department will consider sympathetically any proposals the person named may wish to make to repay the full amount over a period of time.

These schemes were completed in 1998 and 2000 respectively, with a total investment of approximately €12.7 million. There are no plans to consider further works on the Mulcair River catchment.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	871	The issue of integration of occupational pension with the social insurance system was considered by the  Commission on Public Service Pensions. The commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pensions framework and it was strongly of the view that it should be continued. However, in order to enhance the pension position of public servants in full PRSI class and subject to integration and who retire on relatively low levels of pay, it recommended that the operation of integration be amended in order to improve the occupational pension component for such persons.As the Deputy may be aware, the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and to establish the working group to advise on implementation provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by the Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group which it is hoped will be submitted by the end of the year.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	872	I am aware of the campaign for a VAT refund currently being run by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. There is no provision in EU VAT law for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies such as those represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.I would add however that charities already enjoy relief from most taxes. Furthermore, in the 2001 Finance Act, I provided for a new scheme of tax relief for donations to charities. I understand that this has already been of significant benefit to them. Even if VAT relief were possible, the cost to the Exchequer would be substantial, especially in the light of the existing valuable tax concessions to such charities.

The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. There are no plans to remove this levy which yielded €69.11 million in 2001.

I can however say that in September 2001 the Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The working group has met on a number of occasions since January of this year and hopes to be in a position to report by the end of the year. Parallel  structures with the same remit have been established in the case of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group.In relation to the issue of parity of pensions for members of An Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1993, I should point out that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of An Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved.

If in such a case the residential property being purchased is greater than 125 metres square, duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property, whichever is the greater.The table below shows the stamp duty rates applying on the transfer of second-hand residential property after the changes introduced in budget 2002.

The terms of the scheme were considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The commission, which drew together the views of unions, management and independent pensions experts, recommended a provision to allow payment of a pension to a financially dependent partner in certain circumstances. Two members of the commission entered a reservation in this matter to the effect that such a provision would move ahead of the law generally on family units based on marriage.The Government has accepted the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and has established a working group, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, comprising representatives of management and unions to advise on implementation. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations are to be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from this group, which is expected later in the year. Pending receipt of this report, I am not in a position to give a more definitive response to the question posed by the Deputy.

The body's remit was to examine public service pay and jobs, by comparison with the private sector, and make recommendations thereon. The terms of reference of the body were agreed between the public service employers and the public service unions.The body reported on 1 July 2002 and made recommendations on pay rates. Discussions about its implementation began soon after and are continuing. In general, all workers have benefited from the terms of the PPF which gave an average annual increase of 6% in pay terms in addition to the tax reductions in recent budgets. This has resulted in real increases in take-home pay under the PPF.

This was to ensure that as the year progressed the Government would have full and timely information on emerging trends and would be in a position to take decisive action if or when problems were identified to them.In the first four months of the year, the year-on-year increases in overall voted spending by Departments, as published in the Exchequer statements, were January 22%, February 22%, March 17% and April 21%. The end-April expenditure management report which I submitted to Government on 8 May stated that the increase in spending to end-April was affected by timing factors, such as the once-off cost of the 1% lump sum payments under the PPF and the carry-over costs of the budget and PPF measures. The level of spending to end-April was actually slightly below the spending profiles – consistent with full-year spending allocations – submitted by Departments at the start of the year.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	882	Income tax receipts in 2001 were €9,347 million compared to a 2001 budget day target of €9,879 million – a shortfall of €532 million. This is equivalent to an increase of 2.6% over 2000 as compared to a budget target increase of 8.4%.Like all taxes, income tax is affected by the level of activity in the economy. The 2001 budget day target for taxes was predicated on a forecast for economic growth of 8.8% in 2001. Preliminary results from the CSO now suggest that GDP grew by just 5.9% in 2001. Allied to the lower than expected growth in 2001, employment growth was lower at 49,000, than the 60,000 estimated at budget time.A number of other factors also had a negative impact on income tax receipts in 2001. The 2001 Finance Bill introduced further income tax measures additional to those proposed on budget day. These measures, including the special savings investment account scheme, cost approximately €135 million in 2001.In addition, the income tax package included in budget 2001 had, of necessity, to be costed on the basis of the information then available. Subsequent revisions to that information point to the cost of the tax package in 2001 being €242 million higher than originally estimated.

The exemption also applies where a bloodstock breeder trading  in the State acquires a share in a foreign stallion in order that mares owned or partly owned by the breeder may be serviced by the stallion. In this case the exemption applies to tax on any profits or gains from the sale of any nominations from the breeder's share in the stallion. Taxpayers are not required to include income arising from tax exempt stallion fees in their tax returns and the information sought by the Deputy is therefore not available.

My officials have been in contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food to follow up on this issue, and the following is the position.Following the fire at UMP in January 1992, the Department of Agriculture and Food engaged independent consultants to review the nature and scope of insurance cover on the beef intervention stock. As a result of this review a number of upgraded conditions have been applied by the Department since then. However, in the context of preparing for trial of the Ballaghaderreen cases, legal opinions were obtained on a wide range of insurance-related questions which I understand are still in the process of being examined in detail by the Department of Agriculture and Food to assess whether there are any further steps which could be taken to reduce exposure in any similar case in the future.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	891	The issue of the Tobin tax has been considered in a number of fora, including the informal Ecofin meeting at Liège on 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other (non-taxable) alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.Nevertheless, at a formal Ecofin meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, "Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation", was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that "while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated".I remain quite unconvinced of the feasibility of such a tax, given the problems associated with it as outlined above.

This provision only applies where it is proposed to introduce measures for simplifying the procedure for charging VAT or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance. A derogation would not apply in respect of this request by the Deputy since the request would not be covered by any of the requirements of Article 27.I am therefore assuming that the Deputy is asking me to make contact with the European Commission requesting them to bring forward a proposal for a reduced VAT rate for motorcycle helmets and other safety clothing. The Deputy will appreciate that the European Commission has the sole right of initiation of European Union legislation and that any such legislation would require the unanimous agreement of all 15 member states.It is not clear that the Commission would agree to bring forward such a proposal or that the 15 member states would agree to it. In any event, I consider that it is appropriate that VAT on motorcycle helmets and other safety clothing should continue to be standard rated. I have no plans therefore to raise this issue with the Commission.

The main maximum measurements to be used to qualify for zero rating are chest size 32" and waist size 26". I appreciate that this may mean that some children may require adult clothing earlier than others.All other clothing attracts VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent. The provisions of EU VAT law would rule out any extension in the scope of the zero rate at this stage. The practical administration of these provisions is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

However, I am informed that there is currently a backlog of appeals to be dealt with by the board. I understand that the length of time a person waits to be assessed by the board can vary from 12 to 18 months. This is an indication of the level of demand for tax relief under the scheme. In addition, the backlog seem to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal.I am currently examining the Interdepartmental Report on the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme which contains recommendations relating to the Medical Board of Appeal.

In this case the court held that the method of charging tax on used cars being imported into a particular member state was contrary to Article 95 of the Treaty. It did not find that the charging of such tax was in itself contrary to EU legislation.In Ireland, VRT is not calculated on the same basis, and therefore, this ruling does not affect the Irish system. A discussion document was published by the European Commission in September 2002 regarding the taxation of passenger cars. As the Deputy will be aware, all EU Legislation regarding tax must be agreed by unanimity.I have no plans to abolish VRT as it is a significant source of tax revenue to fund necessary public services. In Ireland VRT generates over €800 million per year. To replace this would require, for example, an increase of 2 percentage points in the standard rate of income tax.

Section 32 of the Act provides, inter alia, that a financial institution “shall take reasonable measures to establish the identity of any person for whom it proposes to provide a service”. It is the legal responsibility of each financial institution to ensure that it complies with this provision. The obligation on financial institutions to identify customers is a basic element in the anti-money laundering regime both in Ireland and internationally.The Act does not state what may or may not represent reasonable measures and does not provide for the making of regulations in this regard. Accordingly, in order to facilitate consistent implementation of the anti-money laundering provisions of the Act, Guidance Notes were issued in April 1995 by the Money Laundering Steering Committee, established under the aegis of my Department and representing various sectors of the financial services industry and the relevant authorities.While the 1995 Guidance Notes gave credit institutions discretion to deal with customers who do not possess the recommended forms of identification, it became clear that difficulties were being experienced by particular social groups in opening bank accounts. To deal with this problem the 1995 guidance on customer identification was revised to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations.Following approval by the Money Laundering Steering Committee, revised Guidance Notes were issued to all credit institutions in November 2001 with a request that revised procedures be put in place as soon as possible but in any event no later than 1 May 2002. While the revised Guidance Notes provide additional examples of documents which may be used to verify identity at account opening, the basic recommendation to credit institutions is that they should verify a customers name by seeking a document which bears a photograph and signature. Wherever possible a current valid full passport should be requested. There are of course other documents that customers might produce as evidence of their identity, e.g. driver's licence with photograph, age card issued by the Garda Community Relations Section.

The national development plan, NDP, and the Community Support Framework, CSF, 2000-2006 provide for membership of the monitoring committees to include representatives of the four social partners pillars.Responsibility for assembling the monitoring committees rested with the designated managing authority for the relevant operational programme. The managing authority for each of the operational programmes, in this case the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly and the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, wrote to each of the four social partners pillars, namely, the community and voluntary pillar, the farming pillar, the trades union pillar and the employer-business pillar, inviting each of them to make arrangements for nominations to membership of the regional operational programmes. In deciding upon their representation their attention was drawn to the commitment in the NDP-CSF that gender balance will be promoted on all monitoring committees. Each of the four social partners pillars have two representatives on the monitoring committees.

The assessment, which showed that the taxpayer had a tax liability of €1,066.07, £839.60, was based on the information provided by the taxpayer on his return of income. Following the issue of the assessment, the taxpayer advised the inspector of taxes that  his income had been overstated on his return. On the basis of additional information provided by the taxpayer, the inspector revised the taxpayer's liability to €135.34, £106.59, for the 2001 tax year.As regards the previous tax year 2000-01 the position is that the taxpayer was not liable to pay tax on his income for that year because it was below the exemption limit. His income in 2001 was above the exemption limit. Therefore, he is liable to tax on his 2001 income.

Thus they do not generally charge VAT on their services and do not have the right to recover any of their input VAT.They can, however, be considered to be within the VAT system where they engage in activities or transactions where their treatment as non-taxable persons give rise to significant distortions of competition. In such circumstances, they would be able to recover some or all of their input VAT but would have to charge VAT on the services they are providing.The Exchequer contribution to the operation of local authorities amounts to €419.6 million in 2002. I do not intend to provide separate funding for the recoupment of VAT payments by local authorities. Apart from the concern that such a refund system may not be in compliance with EU VAT law, a VAT refund system as suggested would lead to a narrowing of the VAT base and the fall in VAT revenue from such a refund scheme would need to be made up from other sources.The Valuation Act, 2001 – No. 13 of 2001 – which updated and modernised a body of legislation, which in some cases dated back over a century, listed in two schedules relevant property which is rateable and relevant property which is not rateable. There are no plans to review this legislation.

The Irish Charities Tax Reform Group is currently running a campaign to seek a refund of all the VAT incurred by them. The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. There are no provisions for refund orders under the EU Sixth VAT Directive.I would point out, however, that charities already enjoy relief from most taxes. Furthermore, in Finance Act, 2001, I provided for a new scheme of tax relief for donations to charities. This is a generous scheme which has, I understand, already been of significant benefit to them. Even if VAT relief were possible, the cost to the Exchequer would be substantial, especially in the light of the existing valuable tax concessions to such charities.

In the year 2001, a total of 251 exempted bodies were so reviewed and the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the reviews disclosed a high standard of compliance. The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that while a tax exempted charity is subject to a Revenue audit in the same manner as any other body, records are not kept in such a manner so as to distinguish charity audits from those conducted in other cases.It is not the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to publish the names of charities which have been reviewed or audited by them. A list of bodies which have been granted charitable tax exemption under the Tax Acts is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie, publications, lists. There are currently 5,603 such bodies and the website is updated on a monthly basis.

In relation to my Department, I do not intend establishing a full-time voluntary activity unit. I con sider that a more effective approach is to appoint senior personnel from this Department, with responsibility for formulating policy advice on public expenditure in the relevant areas to work with interdepartmental and voluntary groups set up to implement national agreed policies, that is, the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. This ensures a more integrated and informed approach to funding.For example, the assistant secretary in public expenditure division who advises me in relation to social welfare, education and health expenditure, is a member of the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, and attends meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. It is very important that senior staff who are involved in decisions on the provision of funding for voluntary and publicly funded programmes participate in groups and committees such as these in order to further strengthen the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector.

The value of the programme for projects in this jurisdiction, including matching funding, should be in the region of €71.5 million. The Northern Ireland European Regional Development Fund allocation is €80.8 million to €107.7 million, including matching funding. The three priorities targeted for support under the programme are: (i) integrated local development strategies; (ii) physical infrastructure and the environment; and (iii) civic and community networking.The programme is being managed by the Special EU Programmes Body and will be implemented by a range of Departments, intermediary funding bodies and locally based agencies. The INTERREG partnerships promoted by the three Border corridor groups have been established and are currently developing their internal systems for programme delivery. It is expected that the Programme will be open for applications in the near future.Ireland is also participating in other INTERREG Programmes under the 2000-06 round and the following is the European Regional Development Fund allocation in Ireland in respect of each of these programmes:

There are a wide range of important issues which must be taken into consideration in making decisions in relation to the programme of decentralisation. I am not, as yet, able to say when I expect the Government to be in a position to take such decisions.

It has also included this proposal in its submission to my Department's public consultation on the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland No. 2 Bill, 2002.I agree with the IBOA that the Irish financial sector is a major contributor to the economy, and that there is a need to ensure a strategic approach is taken to its development. To this end I established, in November 1999, the joint Department of Finance and Central Bank Working Group on strategic issues in the banking sector, which reflected on the future challenges facing the industry. The working group, which consulted widely in carrying out its deliberations, published its report as recently as August 2000. It made many recommendations which guide and inform policy development in this area.

As of 1 January 2002 the relief is given at source by the various financial institutions.Where the property is situated in an area designated for special incentives, such as the urban renewal, town renewal or the rural renewal schemes – upper Shannon region – and the individual is an owner occupier, certain tax relief is allowable in respect of eligible expenditure incurred on refurbishment.The property must comply with the requirements relating to floor area applicable to the relevant scheme and be in receipt of a certificate of reasonable cost from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to the expenditure on refurbishment. The relief applies to qualifying expenditure incurred on work carried out during the qualifying period in relation to the particular incentive area. The rural renewal scheme is due to expire on 31 December 2004 and the town renewal scheme on 31 December 2003. The urban renewal scheme expires on 31 December 2002 but can be extended in certain circumstances to 31 December 2004. To qualify for the extended period for the urban renewal scheme the relevant local authority must issue a certificate to the person refurbishing the property on or before 30 April 2003 certifying that the authority is satisfied that at least 15% of the expenditure on refurbishment was incurred by 31 December 2002.In the case of refurbishment expenditure, the relief is 100% of the allowable expenditure allowed at the rate of 10% per annum for ten years.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	923	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the situation whereby the general income tax exemption limits for those aged under 65 years have not been increased since 1998. This is not an anomaly; rather it reflects the policy approach adopted in recent years.Up to budget 1998, the limits were increased virtually every year with a view to keeping those on very low incomes out of the tax net. However, consistent with the recommendations of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare, 1996, the limits for those aged under 65 years have not been increased since 1998 – exemption limits for those aged over 65 have been increased. The expert working group considered that the exemption limits should effectively be phased out. There were two reasons for this: at the time, the interaction between the system of marginal relief, which is an integral part of the exemption limits arrangements, and the withdrawal of FIS was seen as potentially giving rise to a negative impact on work incentives as well as causing severe poverty traps for a small number of people in a narrow band of income; and the group held the view that it was difficult to justify, as a matter of principle, the imposition of high marginal rates of tax on low income.In recent years, low paid individuals have been assisted through increases in personal credits consistent with the expert group's recommendations. For example, as a result of increases in the main personal tax credits, that is, the personal and employee credits, over recent years, the entry point to taxation for a single person is over €209 per week in the current tax year as compared with under €98 per week in 1997.

The strategy maps out the broad direction of procurement policy across the public sector and is focused on the delivery of cost effective procurement in the medium to longer term. The use of e-procurement technologies will be a critical element in the efficient roll out of the strategy.The strategy recommends changes in current structures, processes and systems at national and sector level with a view to re-positioning procurement as a strategic function within public sector organisations. The first major initiative at national level is already under way with the establishment in late June of the National Public Procurement Policy Unit, NPPPU, within my Department. The NPPPU has overall responsibility for developing procurement policy, including support to e-procurement initiatives, in line with the overall thrust of the strategy and the Information Society's Action Plan – New Connections 2002.The programme of work of the NPPPU is consistent with recommendations in the strategy and includes the following areas: work has commenced on a review of existing public procurement policies and practices that will underpin all public service procurement and e-procurement initiatives going forward; further development of the public sector procurement opportunities portal is a priority for the NPPPU and work on this national initiative will be progressed over the next 12 months; procurement strategies, including e-procurement, for the health, local government and education sectors, consistent with the overall direction of the national strategy, are being developed – work on some of these strategies is well advanced and it is expected that implementation projects will be identified as part of this process; and the NPPPU is also directly responsible for developing an approach to procurement and e-procurement across Departments. The NPPPU will be examining options for the roll-out of the strategy across this sector in the coming months.

The Exchequer contribution in respect of each month is paid in the following month on the basis of amounts claimed by the qualified savings managers concerned. The total amount paid out in 2001 was €71 million and the total amount paid out so far this year is €302.4 million.The expected cost to the Exchequer in 2002 is of the order of €435 million on the basis that the level of investment in the most recent month for which figures are available broadly continues. As the scheme did not close until the end of April, and more new accounts were being opened in the first four months of this year, the full year cost will be greater than the 2002 cost. The expected full year cost is of the order of €525 million. The cost of the scheme is affected where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. The expected costs provided above assume that these variations will broadly cancel each other out.

Where the owners of the accounts cannot be traced, the Act provides for the transfer of the moneys in the accounts to the dormant accounts fund, so they can be used for community and charitable purposes. The Act preserves the rights of the account holders – and of their heirs and legal representatives – to reclaim the moneys from those accounts, together with any accrued interest, in the event of claimants coming forward to claim them after the transfer to the fund.

US military aircraft meeting these conditions have been granted permission to refuel at Shannon Airport over a period of decades.In addition, and on an exceptional basis, a decision was taken to waive the normal conditions for the granting of permission for overflight and landing in respect of military aircraft operating pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1368, adopted on 12 September 2001.It has also been the practice, going back many years, for commercial charter aircraft carrying US servicemen between the US and bases overseas to land and refuel at Shannon. Such flights do not require special permission and are subject to the requirements of civil aviation regulations.No arrangements have been agreed with the US Government to facilitate the use of Shannon Airport for the transfer of troops and equipment to the Middle East. Any request for such agreement would be considered in light of the position of the UN Security Council.

Certain interface areas in Belfast have been particularly affected by sectarian attacks ranging from pipe-bomb campaigns to individual assaults. This sustained violence has resulted in a number of deaths and many injuries. Many families have been intimidated out of their homes. Since the start of the year, two young men were murdered by loyalist paramilitaries for purely sectarian motives: Daniel McColgan, a 20 year-old postal worker shot dead in Rathcoole on 12 January, and Gerard Lawlor, aged 19, shot dead on the Whitewell Road in North Belfast on 22 July. In addition, Chris Whitson, a 20 year old student, died on 12 August following a sectarian assault outside a nightclub in Portrush.The situation was particularly acute in the Short Strand area of East Belfast during the summer months, beginning in mid-May. Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government's representatives based at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast were in ongoing contact with local elected and community representatives during these disturbances, including visiting the area on a regular basis to assess the situation at first hand. Because of this presence on the ground, the Government was kept fully appraised of developments as they occurred. In regular, often hourly, contacts with the British Government, we stressed the urgent need for effective and impartial policing and increased security measures to protect the residents of the Short Strand and other interface areas.

My Department has been active in providing consular assistance to the men including visits by consular officials from our Embassy in Mexico and assistance to representatives of the men's families, some of whom I met recently.We have consistently made representations to the Colombian authorities at political and diplomatic levels to ensure that the men are held in safe accommodation and that they have satisfactory living conditions and have adequate access to their lawyers. I raised this matter most recently with the Colombian Foreign Minister in New York in September.I am aware of the media interest in this case and I have emphasised to successive Colombian Foreign Ministers the importance of ensuring that the men receive a fair trial. In this regard, the Government will be represented at the forthcoming hearing by a diplomatic officer from the Embassy in Mexico acting as an observer.I deplore the death threats against the legal representatives of the three men and I have asked our ambassador to convey my concern in this regard to the Colombian authorities in Bogota.My Department will continue to monitor this case very closely and to provide all possible consular assistance to the three men.

Should the people decide that the State may ratify the Nice treaty, the National Declaration will be lodged with the instrument of ratification and forwarded to the United Nations.The Seville Declarations provide authoritative statements by the Government and by the 15 EU member states and the European Commission that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is fully compatible with, and safeguarded by, the EU treaties. including the Treaty of Nice.All the legal guarantees which Ireland needs in the security and defence area are already in the European treaties. These treaties are legally binding, as are the safeguards which they contain. Since the treaties contain no obligations inconsistent with our traditional policy of military neutrality, the question of seeking legally binding opt outs from the treaties does not arise.

As its preamble states, it is intended to complete the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam of preparing the institutions of the European Union to function in an enlarged Union.The treaty represents the shared assessment of the existing member states of the changes necessary to ensure that the institutions of the European Union continue to work efficiently and effectively after the accession of up to 12 new member states.The intention is that ten of the 12 countries negotiating to join will be in a position to sign an Accession Treaty in early 2003, so as to join the Union in 2004. The institutional aspects of that treaty are to be as set out in the Treaty of Nice.If the Treaty of Nice is not ratified, there is no agreed basis on which these countries will be able to join the EU as planned.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	950	I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 503 together.Ireland is a strong advocate of the system of collective international security based on the United Nations Charter. Under the terms of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. All member states of the United Nations are bound by the UN Charter to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.Iraq is therefore obliged to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions and must live up fully to the conditions imposed on it by the Security Council. This means, as regards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq must agree to the return of arms inspectors in full accordance with the conditions laid down in Security Council resolutions, and not seek to impose its own conditions.The Government shares in the growing international consensus that the Iraqi regime poses a potential threat to regional security. Up until now, Iraq has consistently failed to meet its obligations under international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. Their recent decision to admit weapons inspectors without preconditions and in accordance with those resolutions is clearly a highly important development and is to be welcomed. However, past experience shows that the performance of the Iraqi regime must be judged on action not words.We look forward to the earliest possible agreement on the return of the inspectors and the rapid commencement of work on the ground. We have been closely following the recent discussions that Mr. Hans Blix, head of the UN Weapons Inspection team, and Mr. Al Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have been engaged in with the Iraqi authorities. These talks have resulted in substantial agreement on practical arrangements for the future work of the inspection team – although some issues in relation to the modalities of access remain to be finalised. We are ready to study any proposal for a further Security Council resolution which would bring further clarity to the conditions under which the inspectors would operate and would strengthen their ability to do their job.

I condemned that attack in a public statement of 23 July in which I said that:"the use of air launched missiles in densely populated areas can only result in civilian casualties on the scale we have seen today. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous. This kind of attack is not a reasoned or proportionate response to the threat of terrorism".These sentiments were echoed by our Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York during a public meeting of the Security Council on 24 July where he also condemned the attack as an act of gross brutality.The question of the criminal responsibility of individual political leaders for the acts of their forces is a complex one and is, in the first instance, a matter for national legal systems.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	952	The Government is keenly aware of the grave humanitarian situation now facing Zimbabwe and the Southern Africa region. Recent assessments carried out by the United Nations World Food Programme – WFP – indicate that over 14 million people in Southern Africa will be in need of food assistance by next March. Nearly half of these are in Zimbabwe.In response to this food crisis, Ireland Aid, the official aid programme of the Government, has delivered over €8 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance for the affected countries in Southern Africa to date this year. Financial support has been given to the key international organisations providing food aid in Zimbabwe and other affected countries in Southern Africa – in May €0.5 million was provided for the International Federation of the Red Cross in response to its food security appeal and in July over €1 million was allocated to the WFP. To date this year, €1.2 million has been delivered to Irish non-governmental organisations – NGOs – for the provision of food relief in Zimbabwe.The Government's concern at the situation in Southern Africa has also been underlined by the fact that the Minister of State with special responsibility for Overseas Development Assistance, Deputy Kitt, visited Malawi and Zambia last August and witnessed at first hand the devastating effect that famine, drought and HIV-AIDs are having on the people of the region. The Minister of State also viewed the excellent work being carried out by Irish non-governmental organisations and by missionaries and their local counterparts in seeking to alleviate the worst effects of the crisis.The WFP Country Director for Zimbabwe visited Dublin in September and briefed Ireland Aid on the food situation in Zimbabwe. A senior Ireland Aid official is scheduled to travel to Harare shortly to meet with relevant international organisations, Irish NGOs and missionaries to review Ireland's emergency humanitarian aid programme and to co-ordinate further assistance.I would note that, in addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland Aid is also delivering long-term development support to the region with an emphasis on poverty reduction through the provision of basic needs and capacity building support. In 2002 it is estimated that such support for Southern Africa will exceed €80 million.Ireland's financial support has been complemented by ongoing political action. The Government has been working closely with its partners at the European Union and United Nations to develop strategies on how immediate food needs across Southern Africa may best be addressed at both the national and regional levels.

He has called for a cessation of violence by the illegal armed groups in order to enable talks to commence. We will support such talks as the only way of bringing about a lasting peace, and we welcome President Uribe's invitation to the UN to play a central facilitating role.Ireland and the EU will also support the Colombian Government and people in meeting the daunting array of challenges – political, economic and social – which face them. We welcome President Uribe's commitment to meet these challenges, including those posed by terrorism and drug trafficking – with full respect for the principles of democracy, for human rights and for the rule of law.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	954	There is no place in our democracies for the use or the threat of the use of force. Democracy means that issues must be addressed through respect for human life, for the rule of law, and the political process.As I understand the situation, ETA and the political party associated with it, Batasuna, have not abandoned the use of violence and have not committed themselves to exclusively peaceful and democratic means of pursuing their aims. In these circumstances, I would not wish to enter into a debate on the democratic decision of the Spanish Parliament to adopt a law on political parties which has resulted in the banning of Batasuna.In his question, the Deputy refers to doing "further harm to the Basque peace process". The best way to avoid further harm would be for ETA to desist from violence and, together with their associates in Batasuna, commit themselves exclusively to democratic means of pursuing their aims.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The Government decided in September 2000 to  achieve by 2007 the UN target for ODA expenditure of 0.7% of GNP. The Programme for Government makes clear that "we will complete our major expansion of our overseas development aid programme, achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007". At the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the Taoiseach reconfirmed the Government's clear commitment to this objective.Due to current economic circumstances, the size of the budget increase for the Ireland Aid programme this year will be €32 million less than originally envisaged. The revised allocation for 2002 is €340 million. I want to emphasise that, while we will not reach 0.45% of GNP this year, the €340 million allocation represents an increase of €100 million over the 2001 budget and is the largest single annual increase in the history of the programme. In the history of Ireland Aid, it is an unprecedented level of resources.

The primary responsibility for the ratification of Protocol 12 lies with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I understand that this is currently under examination by that Department.Ireland has a comprehensive anti-discrimination protection legal code in place since the enactment of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts which prohibit discrimination on nine separate grounds. It has also put in place an equality infrastructure which offers redress for individuals to pursue complaints in regard to discrimination experienced on any of these grounds. Ireland, has, therefore, already provided in national law for many of the provisions of Protocol 12. Ten ratifications are needed for this protocol to come into force; to date Georgia and Cyprus are the only states to have ratified the protocol.

The EU discussed and replied with a joint response to this proposal. It was decided not to pursue such an appointment, since it was agreed that any EU Special Representative would be unable to contribute effectively in Tibet, without Chinese support.The EU is aware that China has refused to allow the US State Department's Tibet co-ordinator, Ms Paula Dobriansky, to visit Tibet. The EU believes that nominating an EU Special Representative would not achieve anything practical and that our concerns would be more effective when expressed to the Chinese authorities directly.In our bilateral contacts with China, and through the European Union, Ireland has continued to raise and pursue our concerns with the Chinese Government and urge them to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	960	On 5 July 2002, I wrote to the Romanian Minister for Foreign Affairs on this issue. This was a follow up on our meeting en marge of the Afghanistan Conference in Tokyo last January when we discussed reforms within Romania in the context of progress towards EU accession. I am encouraged to note that positive steps have been taken in the area of child care reform, including the adoption of a National Strategy on Reform of the Child Care System, the establishment of a National Agency for the Protection of Children's Rights and the adoption of normative standards and levels of child care services. However, there remains much to be done and in my letter of 5 July 2002, I asked for the Minister's views in relation to how any external assistance could be fully integrated with Romania's National Strategy on reform of the child care system.The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the pre-accession process, the European Commission conducts ongoing reviews of progress in relation to a number of economic, social and political criteria set by the European Council and publishes regular reports. I understand that the Commission is issuing an evaluation report today and I will note with interest the findings and recommendations relating to institutional child care.Ireland Aid allocates resources through a number of trust funds which operate in the region. In 2001, €431,710 was allocated to the Irish General Consultancy Trust Fund – CTF – of the World Bank for activities in the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Ireland contributed €253,948 to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development – EBRD – Trust Fund which assists the economic transition process and development of the institutional infrastructure within Eastern Europe.

The House will be aware that both the Taoiseach and myself have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Chinese authorities. We will continue to do so in our bilateral contacts, as part of our efforts towards a resolution of this issue. It remains our view that human rights are an integral element of our dialogue with China. Ireland would urge the Chinese authorities not to act against the principles contained in the UN Covenants signed by China, in particular those relating to the freedoms of expression, assembly and association.The rights of Falun Gong members have also been raised through European Union channels, notably through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which had its latest meeting in Beijing, from 5-6 March last. At this meeting, there were frank and open discussions with the Chinese authorities on the Falun Gong, during which the EU reiterated its human rights concerns. The EU will continue to raise these concerns at all appropriate opportunities.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	963	This question falls within the responsibilities of my colleague, Deputy Brennan, the Minister for Transport.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	964	It is a matter of profound regret that the people of Iraq continue to suffer considerable hardship as a result of their Government's deliberate and persistent violation of successive UN Security Council resolutions aimed at preserving international peace and security.Ireland has worked to ensure that UN sanctions are administered in such a way as to ensure that the humanitarian and long-term economic interests of the people of Iraq are secured, while ensuring that the necessary controls are in place to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction. The provision of medical supplies is a particular priority among those humanitarian interests.As a member of the Security Council, Ireland was active in developing Resolution 1409, which was adopted in May 2002 and seeks to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising the impact of those sanctions on the civilian population. In particular, the provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure that there would be continuing availability of medical supplies for the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children. Iraqi Government requests to purchase food and medicines under the Oil for Food programme are given priority. All such requests are examined by the Office of the Iraq Programme and, where they include items which appear on the Goods Review List, are referred to the appropriate UN Security Council Sanctions Committee, with the aim of ensuring that necessary humanitarian goods, including medical supplies, are available and that no materials are imported which could be used for weapons of mass destruction.The Government will ensure that Ireland continues to be active on the UN Security Council and within the European Union in seeking to highlight the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.The fact remains, however, that the most effective way of easing the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people and avoiding any escalation in the current situation would be for the Iraqi Government to act immediately to meet its obligation under the UN Charter by complying fully with the demands placed upon it by the Security Council.

The comparative allocation for 2001 was €292,000. No consultancy or capital projects have been cancelled or postponed this year. It is anticipated that further projects, which will be funded under other subheads of Vote 38, this year will include consultancies for the following projects: the development of a new automated passport system; a strategic review with the Anglo-Irish Encounter reconciliation group; a legal equality scrutiny in relation to departmental regulations; and the development of an ICT strategy for the Department.The Development Co-operation Directorate of my Department commissions a significant number of consultancies, funding for which is provided under subhead A7 of Vote 39. The approved budget for this subhead for 2002 is €1.893 million, comprising fees of €1.580 million and expenses of €0.313 million. There has been no reduction in this subhead in 2002.The consultancies cover a broad range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on appraisal and evaluation of development programmes. A number of experts are also engaged to assist in the evaluation of funding proposals submitted to Ireland Aid for emergency relief and recovery funding.A number of entities operate under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs. These include the Agency for Personal Service Overseas – APSO – the National Committee for Development Education – NCDE – and the Irish Aid Advisory Committee – IAAC – which has been replaced by the Advisory Board of Ireland Aid – ABIA.In the case of APSO, the budget for consultant and related study contracts for 2002 is €126,974. No APSO consultancies have been postponed. No further consultancy projects are under consideration for 2002.The NCDE has made provision of €393,858 for consultancies in its 2002 Estimates.

The provision for measures to promote access to further and higher education has increased significantly from €0.5 million in 1997 to €24 million in 2002.The Millennium Partnership Fund for Disadvantage is one of a number of measures aimed at increasing access to third level education, which was introduced following the publication, in July 2001, of the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education.

It is, therefore, primarily a matter for each school to establish rules on what is and is not acceptable for students to do while on the school premises, provided that those rules are lawful, fair and reasonable. I am not aware of any rule of law which would prevent schools imposing a ban on eating certain foodstuffs, although any special dietary needs of students would have to be taken into account.My Department supports the view that good nutrition is central to a child's educational development. Evidence from existing studies shows that there is a significant positive relationship between improved dietary status and school performance.A knowledge of what constitutes a nutritionally balanced diet is acknowledged as being of importance for students. To support this, nutrition education is featured in the curriculum in both primary and post-primary schools.

The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is agreed for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 169 pupils which warrants a staffing of a teaching principal and five mainstream class teachers for the 2002-2003 school year. The school also has the services of a resource teacher and a shared learning support teacher.As the agreed appointment figure for the sixth mainstream class teacher of 175 pupils has not been achieved, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction an additional post at St. Andrew's National School for the 2002-2003 school year.The Deputy may be aware that I recently established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board will operate independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision will be final.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	985	Earlier this year difficulties arose in Scoil Tulach na nÓg, Dunboyne, in relation to two distinct issues – firstly disciplinary proceedings in relation to the principal teacher and, secondly, the wider issue of the teaching of religion.With regard to the disciplinary proceedings, these are employer-employee matters which are entirely for resolution between the board of management, the principal teacher and the patron body. They are not matters in which either the Minister or the Department can interfere.Primary schools are private institutions under independent management. The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of the school and is the employer of the teachers in the school, including the principal teacher. The board is entitled to take disciplinary proceedings against a teacher if it considers that his or her conduct is or has been in some way unacceptable. Procedures are in place at local level for dealing with such matters and these procedures do not provide for the involvement of the Minister or the Department. In addition, an employee has recourse to employment law to ensure due process.In the case of Scoil Tulach na nÓg the principal was suspended and subsequently dismissed and I understand that the case is the subject of an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.On the wider issue of the teaching of religion, the school is under the patronage of an Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán Ghaeilge. Its ethos is described by the patron body as interdenominational, whereby equal status is given to the Catholic and Church of Ireland religions. It is a matter for patron bodies to decide on the ethos which will apply in individual schools and neither the Minister nor the Department has any wish to interfere in such matters.The Department does not lay down a religious education curriculum at primary level. It is a matter for the patron to outline the religious education programme which it expects the school to follow under its patronage and to determine how the programme should be taught. The Department's only stipulation is that a minimum of 30 minutes per day must be allocated to the teaching and implementing of religious education curricula.However, to assist in resolving the difficulties surrounding the teaching of religion at Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg, as opposed to the disciplinary matters referred to above, I supported and funded a facilitation process between the parties. My Department was not a party to this process.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	990	Anti-racism attitudes are fostered through a number of curricular areas in primary and second level schools.At primary level, subjects such as social, personal and health education, geography and history contribute to the development of knowledge, skills and attitudes that encourage respect for human and cultural diversity. Social, personal and health education – SPHE – seeks to foster in the child a sense of care and respect for himself-herself and others and an appreciation of the dignity of every human being. It also seeks to enable the child to respect human and cultural diversity and to appreciate and understand the interdependent nature of the world. In addition, the geography curriculum aims to enable children to develop empathy with people from diverse environments and an understanding of human interdependence, while the history curriculum is designed to enable children to acquire a balanced appreciation of cultural and historical inheritances from local, national and global contexts.These aims are reflected in many of the detailed objectives outlined in the various strands and strand units of these curricula. For example, in the strand unit developing citizenship in the SPHE curriculum at fifth and sixth class level, children will be taught "to recognise and acknowledge the various cultural, religious, ethnic or other groups that exist in a community or society and explore ways in which these differences can be respected". At the same level in the geography curriculum, the strand human environments provides that children will learn about and appreciate the peoples and communities who live and work in the locality, in other parts of Ireland, Europe and the wider world. In doing so, the curriculum states that they will "develop an increasing awareness of the interdependence of people in these places and people in Ireland" and "learn to value and respect the diversity of peoples and their lifestyles in these areas and other parts of the world".At second level, civic, social and political education – CSPE – and geography are among the subject areas that seek explicitly to develop responsible citizenship and anti-racist values.

Schools targeted were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. The survey provides a valuable and objec tive basis for directing resources to the pupils in greatest need. It is the most comprehensive survey ever of the incidence of educational disadvantage in primary schools in Ireland. In total, 2,145 schools are now participating in Giving Children An Even Break. The programme, which will cost €33 million and will run over a three-year period involves the creation of more than 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.There are separate urban and rural dimensions to Giving Children An Even Break and the school referred to by the Deputy has been included in the urban dimension. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period, through staff allocations, to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth classes.The school referred to by the Deputy was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. The school is benefiting from additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of school supports for the pupils concerned.An expansion of this programme is now taking place, following examination by the Educational Research Centre at the request of the Department, regarding survey returns received from schools not already participating under a second round process and consideration of appeals received from participating schools unhappy with the outcome of the survey carried out in 2000.On this basis, additional resources are now being offered to selected schools. In total, 268 schools have been considered under this process and those deemed eligible will receive either teaching and-or funding support under the urban or rural dimension of Giving Children An Even Break.The school in question will be informed of the outcome of process shortly.

The increase in the charge brings the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing these services.Students who are eligible for means tested student support will, in addition to any grant to which they are entitled, have the €670 charge paid on their behalf, either directly by my Department or through the local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that 34% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.The increase in the charge should be viewed in the context of an overall package of measures I announced earlier this year aimed at increasing and improving the student support schemes for the 2002-03 academic year. In the present financial year the Government will spend more than €360 million on student supports, including free fees. The measures announced are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to enhancing access to third level education. The range of measures form part of an integrated package, which is designed to maximise and target limited resources towards students who are eligible for student support.It is estimated that the cost per student of providing third level education in the present academic year will exceed €6,000 for arts, law and business courses, €8,000 for science courses and €9,000 for engineering and medicine. The contribution from the students has to be seen in the light of these figures. I have no plans to reverse the charge.

The extension  of the schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available, under the schemes, for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside Ireland could be considered only in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education section.However, the Deputy may be aware that section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, as amended by section 29 of the Finance Act, 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in publicly funded colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax. It is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.

As an initial response, and as an exceptional matter in some cases, my Department has funded a wide range of available courses for special needs assistants, including courses provided by a private training school.Special needs assistants have an important role to play in the overall provision for children with special needs. They bring various levels of experience and training to these positions. It has been essential, therefore, for my Department to give careful attention to the development of a suitable training programme for special needs assistants. This has been done in consultation with the colleges of education and, as part of this process, seminars involving school principals, special needs assistants and teachers have been organised by St. Angela's College, Sligo and by Mary Immaculate College, Limerick. Arising from this work, it was agreed that certificate courses would be offered immediately, on a pilot basis, by these colleges and that certificate courses, along similar lines, would also be provided by the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, in the coming school year.Experience of the various initiatives, and ongoing discussion with the providers, continue to inform decisions regarding suitable training programmes for special needs assistants, taking into account the context in which they work and the importance of their role in assisting teachers to meet the needs of children with special needs. In this regard, I should add that discussions with the colleges of education, in particular, have clearly indicated that home study courses are not an effective method of delivering training programmes of this kind.The delivery of the certificate courses will further inform decisions regarding suitable ways of delivering training to special needs assistants. In the meantime, and in addition to the courses outlined above, my Department will continue to consider requests from schools for relevant in-career development and will support suitable initiatives, including those proposed locally through the Education Centre Network. However, funding for home study courses will not be provided in 2002-03.Boards of management of individual schools have some discretion in the area of funding for in-career development courses for staff.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.Based on details supplied to my Department with representations previously received from the Deputy in respect of the candidate, it would appear the reckonable income in this case exceeds the set income threshold for purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant.It is not open to me, or to my Department, to depart from the terms of the special rates of maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

Therefore, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students.The rent-a-room relief scheme was introduced in the Finance Act, 2001. It allows homeowners to rent out a room in their homes and have rental income up to €7,620 a year tax free. The scheme encourages householders to rent rooms to students.My Department does not provide direct financial assistance for the provision of student accommodation.

The applications from Institute of Technology, Sligo, to which the Deputies refer came into this category.As any expansion of the range of provision by the technological sector would have significant implications not only for that sector but for third level provision generally, it was decided not to approve any such applications pending a review of the remit of the institutes of technology in relation to the provision of courses. In that context the views of the council of directors of institutes of technology and of the Higher Education Authority have been sought. I will consider the matter further when the review is complete.

Under existing guidelines, post-primary pupils who reside no more than two miles from the route of service to their appropriate school are considered to have an adequate level of service.The medical evidence submitted in respect of the pupil was forwarded to my Department's medical adviser who determined that her condition would not prevent her from making her own way to a pick-up point or school. As the pupil is considered to have an adequate level of service, an extension of service is not warranted in this case.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1024	The Deputy is referring to the National Forum for Early Childhood Education, which was established in 1998 as part of the commitment in the last programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to prioritise the development of early childhood care and education. Following presentations made to the national forum by 32 organisations involved in early childhood care and education, a compre hensive report was published by the forum's secretariat in 1998. Rather than making specific recommendations, the report set out key principles and issues for the future development of early childhood care and education on which broad agreement was reached at the forum. These include developing a national framework to promote high quality care and education in home and centre settings; safeguarding diversity of provision; promoting family friendly employment policies; recognising the role of parents; ensuring co-ordination and integration of services; regulating staff training and accreditation; enhancing access for children who are disadvantaged or have special needs; and sponsoring research.The report was accepted by the Government as a basis for the preparation of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which was published in December 1999. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for children aged from birth to six years. Following its publication, my Department carried out an extensive post-consultation process with all of those who made presentations to the national forum. The aim of these consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper and to enable the necessary planning and preparatory work for implementation to be undertaken by my Department in line with commitments given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.This culminated in the appointment last autumn of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Dublin Institute of Technology to set up and jointly manage a new centre for early childhood development and education. The centre has been given the following remit: to establish a national quality framework for early childhood education in all its aspects which is capable of being applied in the various settings in which this is provided; to develop targeted interventions for children up to six years who are disadvantaged or who have special needs, building on the experience of existing initiatives; and to lay the groundwork for the establishment of an early childhood education agency as envisaged by the White Paper.A budget of some €3.2 million has been approved for the operation of the centre over a three year period. A full-time director, three development officers and two administrative support staff have now been appointed to progress the work of the centre under the supervision of a management committee comprising representatives of St. Patrick's College and the Dublin Institute of Technology. The work of the centre will be undertaken in close consultation with my Department and the various stakeholders in the sector.

In order to be eligible, primary school children must live at least two miles from, and be attending, their nearest national school or school of amalgamation.Concessionary fare paying transport may be allowed to children attending Belmont national school from Miltown school area provided the written agreement of Miltown national school is obtained and there are spare places available on an existing service. Concessions, if granted, do not extend to anyone other than those for whom agreement is obtained, nor is there any implied commitment to allow a similar concession to other children.

In the interim, I am arranging for the issue of remediation works at the school for radon to be treated as a separate project. The design team will be requested to put the necessary procedures in place as soon as possible to deal with this issue. My Department will be in contact with the schools concerned when the programme for 2003 is published.It should be clearly understood that the primary responsibility for the health and safety of the pupils and teachers at Barnaderg national school rests with the school's board of management. The onus is on the board of management to use the annual minor works grant that they receive from my Department so as to ensure that urgent health and safety issues are satisfactorily addressed. If necessary, my Department will consider supplementing this grant as an interim measure until a major project can be undertaken at the school.

When the matter was originally brought to my Department's attention, my officials corresponded with both the parents and the board of management, setting out the responsibilities of the board and outlining the Department's complaints procedure.My officials subsequently received permission from the parents of the child to pursue the matter on their behalf with the board of management of the school.In an effort to bring this matter to a conclusion, the local inspector has been requested to interview the various parties involved, including the parents, and to submit a report on the matter.It is expected that the investigation will be concluded on receipt of the inspector's report and the parents will be informed of the outcome at that stage. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to conclude this matter as speedily as possible.

Hard copies of the schemes were subsequently issued on 15 July 2002. The official closing date for applications, as prescribed in the schemes of student support, was 30 August 2002 as compared with a closing date of 10 August 2001 in respect of the 2001 schemes.Significant amendments to the application form and notes booklet for applicants were required in view of the short, transitional tax period, April 2001 to December 2001. Also, the process of printing and subsequent delivery of the application forms took considerably longer than had been initially notified to the Department. When my Department became aware of the delay in the printing operation, the application form and notes booklet were issued to the awarding bodies via electronic mail, to allow the option of issuing forms as early as possible to prospective applicants. A hard copy of the material issued on the same day. My Department understands, however, that in most, if not all cases, the awarding bodies decided to await delivery of their printed orders.As noted, the official closing date for applications as prescribed in the schemes of student support was 30 August 2002. The local authorities have discretion, however, to accept late applications and generally do so.The awarding bodies process grant applications as speedily as possible and issue grant payments to eligible students as early as possible in the academic year. My Department understands that the student, referred to by the Deputy, has been awarded the full rate of maintenance grant by Dublin City Council, in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.

In this context, a review of second level provision in the Newport area is being undertaken by the planning section of my Department and a decision on the Newport proposal will be taken on foot of this review. Pending the outcome of this review, no further action in relation to the development of the school is proposed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	The assessment of means under my Department's third level schemes of student support is based on gross income from all sources with certain social welfare and health board payments being exempt. When assessing income from self-employment/farming the amount assessed is the adjusted profit/loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted  profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes.Finance lease arrangements are an alternative method of funding the acquisition of fixed assets. The lease payments comprise two elements: (a) repayment of the "purchase outright" cost of the asset; and (b) finance charges levied by the lease company. As these two elements are directly related to capital additions, the expenditure is not deductible for higher education grants purposes.

Under existing guidelines, pupils residing less than 1.5 miles from the route of service to a primary school are considered to have a reasonable service.The pupil in question resides well within guidelines and has a level of service that compares favourably with the standard in operation throughout the country as a whole. In any event, Bus Éireann, who operate the service on behalf of my Department, have advised that the road past the home of this pupil is unsuitable for a large bus to operate safely.

As the family are availing of fare-paying transport, the present service is the most that can be offered.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	I propose to take Questions Nos. 574 and 575 together.Special rates of maintenance grant for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.The target group of "those most in need" has been defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled. The special rates of grant are also available to mature students who meet the prescribed conditions.Earlier this year, my Department carried out a review of the operation of the special rates of maintenance grant. This review also has had the benefit of input from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.Arising from the review, the criteria for the special rates were broadened significantly and a number of additional social welfare payments have been included as eligible payments, for purposes of the scheme. As disability benefit is considered to be a short-term payment, it is not included as an eligible payment for purposes of the special rates of maintenance grant. Invalidity pension is, however, considered a long-term welfare payment. Persons in receipt of disability benefit must apply, and be assessed, for invalidity pension.In the case referred to by the Deputy, it is indicated that the candidate's father has now applied for invalidity pension. If the application is successful the candidate will be eligible to be reassessed for the special rate of grant, as a result of the change in circumstances, with effect from the date the invalidity pension is approved from.

Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service.The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated part-time resource teaching support for the current school year. The school has recently appealed to my Department for an increase in this allocation. The appeal has been referred to the psychological service for a report. As soon as the report has been received and considered, my Department will advise the school authorities of the decision in the matter.

Accordingly, I regret that there is no basis on which I can sanction an extension to her sick leave beyond this date.Officials of my Department have corresponded with the teacher referred to and have set out, in a letter of 1 August 2002, the options available to this person if she is not fit to resume duty after 4 November 2002.

To address this issue, a number of new community schools were built throughout the State. Of necessity, these buildings were provided within a very short time frame. Due to the economic circumstances prevailing at the time the buildings were relatively inexpensive and had a finite life expectancy.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	The staffing of a primary school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is agreed for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.The enrolment of Cushinstown national school on 30 September 2001 was 77 pupils which warrants a staffing of a teaching principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year. As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction an additional post at Cushinstown national school for the 2002-03 school year.The Deputy may be aware that my Department recently issued a circular to primary schools, (Circular 19/02), outlining information regarding the independent appeals board established to consider appeals on mainstream staffing in primary schools.In future years all appeals on mainstream staffing in primary schools must be submitted to the independent appeals board by boards of management.

Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE schemes, my predecessor secured the transfer of some €58.4 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school-based  community employment schemes (CE) come to an end.The availability of this funding, that has been transferred to my Department from FÁS, has enabled significant progress to be made in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to primary and second level schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. The increases in the level of the school services support grants will be of benefit to the vast majority of primary and second level schools. The transfer of the money to this Department from FÁS also ensures that this money will now be available on an ongoing basis.I am aware however that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. In this regard, my Department has set aside a sum of approximately €2.5 million in 2002 to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools. However, no decisions have yet been taken as to how this money will be allocated.My Department has agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years' participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.

This year, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2002. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2002-03 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.7%.Similarly, my approach was to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 7% in the reckonable income limits for the 2002-03 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 2000 to March 2001, which was 6.7%. I also increased by 15% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study, in line with the commitment in the June 2002 programme for government.

Under these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution.Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents income or address.When assessing the means of students other that independent mature students, the schemes specify that the students means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.Similar provisions apply in relation to the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.

Recognised pupils who reside over three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live, are eligible for transport under the scheme to that centre.Alternatively, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.The position in this case is that the family concerned reside in the Crossmolina catchment area, and are eligible for catchment boundary transport only to Belmullet. It is not open to my Department to allow a service encroach into another catchment area as this would be contrary to the terms of the scheme.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1064	My Department is committed to the Governments strategy as outlined in the Environmental Protection Agencys report on the need for development of a domestic processing market for waste of all kinds.Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school books are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level. School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. Textbooks have to be changed periodically, however, to enable teachers to keep their own and their students work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date. It is unavoidable therefore that some books will become obsolete over time. I am satisfied, however, that the problem of disposal of unwanted textbooks is minimised to the greatest possible extent by the policies operated by my Department.With regard to the suggestion that textbooks no longer required in our schools might be somehow re-used in schools in developing countries, while this does happen to some extent, it should be remembered that, just as in Ireland, each of those sovereign countries decides on its own curricula, which will reflect its individual national culture and other needs. In general, therefore, books designed for Irish schools would not be suitable for schools in another country.

This review of the organisational and staffing structures of vocational education committees was commissioned, following consultations with the IVEA and IMPACT.The report sets out a comprehensive blueprint for structural and administrative change that is designed to give vocational education committees the capability of responding to increased demands, to meet higher standards of accountability and in providing value for money. The proposals provide for improved organisation structures and management systems, a formula based approach to decision-making on staffing allocations, and a significant enhancement of the supervisory grade structure in line with public service norms.The report reflects very clearly that the process of strengthening administrative structures is a complex and multi-faceted issue, which requires careful planning, consultation and co-operation by all concerned.Discussions are at an advanced stage with the IVEA and IMPACT towards the development of a common understanding in relation to the actual structural and staffing changes for each VEC based on the staffing framework set out in the report for the VEC sector.While further work remains to be done, I wish to assure the Deputy of my commitment to progressing this matter in consultation with all concerned.

Prior to that date such teachers had to gain full recognition i.e. fulfil the Irish language requirement, before becoming eligible to teach in mainstream classes in primary schools. However, with effect from 1 September 2000 teachers trained outside the EU, whose qualifications are assessed and accepted by my Department are granted a five year period of provisional recognition. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are required to work towards meeting my Department's Irish language requirements.There are 188 teachers who obtained their teacher training outside the European Union (EU) recognised to hold teaching posts in primary schools. Of these, 109 have fulfilled the Irish requirement to teach in primary schools. Statistics are not available to my Department on the number of non-EU trained teachers currently employed in national schools.Teachers trained outside the EU on being granted either full recognition prior to 1 September 2000 or provisional recognition thereafter are allowed incremental credit in respect of approved teaching service outside the EU up to a maximum of seven years or a maximum of four years for service given prior to 1 June 1979. The combined maximum cannot exceed seven years.Schools who employ teachers with provisional recognition have a responsibility to ensure that appropriate arrangements are made for the teaching of the Irish curriculum to classes to which provisionally recognised teachers are allocated. Schools have been instructed that under no circumstances must such classes be deprived of competent Irish language tuition and are required to show what arrangements are in place to my Department's inspectors when they visit the schools.

A further 346 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants were employed in the second level system.The level of special needs assistant support allocated to a particular school is based on the professionally assessed needs of the child or children attending the school at any given time. Such allocations are adjusted on an ongoing basis in response to evolving needs. The majority of full-time special needs assistant posts are allocated to groups of children with special needs, including those attending special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools. The precise number of posts dedicated to individual children with special needs is not readily available.The number of hours which a special needs assistant is contracted to work varies between full-time and part-time posts. Part-time special needs assistants are contracted to deliver a specified number of hours per week in the schools to which they are attached.

Each special class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 7:1.My Department also provides resource teaching support for children with specific speech and language disorders who are attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis.A prerequisite to the establishment of special classes for children with specific speech and language disorders is the availability of an appropriate speech and language therapy service. Responsibility for the provision of such services rests with the relevant health authority. My Department liaises with the health authorities in the establishment of such classes.

The catchment boundary system is also used by school transport section to determine eligibility for school transport services and to avoid an open situation, which would be unsustainable in terms of costs and difficult to organise. Recognised pupils who reside over three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they live, are eligible for transport under the scheme to that centre.Alternatively, eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.

The condition in relation to residency applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.The residency condition in the free fees initiative can be disregarded in the case of the following: children of Department of Foreign Affairs officials who are on assignment in countries outside of the EU; children of semi-State agency officials who are on assignment in countries outside of the EU; an eligible volunteer development worker or a family member of an eligible volunteer development worker; children of certain Irish officials working with the United Nations.In order to qualify for grant assistance under my Department's schemes of student support, all candidates must fulfil specified conditions, including those relating to age, residence, means and nationality. To fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate her-himself, must have been resident in the administrative  area of the relevant local authority or VEC from 1 October of the year prior to entry to an approved course. The local authority or VEC has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirements under the terms of the schemes are eligible to apply for a means tested fees-only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education in an EU member state, from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1102	My Department provides funding  towards the cost of secretarial services in secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is that introduced in 1978-79 for the employment of secretaries in secondary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. There are currently 169 secretarial posts in some 164 secondary schools, which are currently paid under this scheme. The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant.It has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of secretarial and caretaking services in schools. This scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which such services are provided. Responsibility for the making of appointments is a matter for school authorities and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed.Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding of such services in second level schools. Under the school services support initiative, the school services grant which was increased from €25.40 per pupil to €63.49 per pupil in September 2001, has been further increased to €88.88 per pupil from September last. Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of these measures, secondary schools covered by the 1978-79 secretarial scheme, and in receipt of caretaking grants of up to €11,110 per school introduced under the PESP programme, qualify for a range of equalisation grants, that were approved in December last, of up to €6,666 per school, €19 per pupil, and a further increase of €28 in the support services grant, bringing the rate to €116.88 per pupil from last September. In the case of secondary schools that are not covered by the 1978-79 secretarial scheme and are in receipt of secretarial and caretaking PESP grants of up to €24,400 per school, such schools will qualify annually for an enhanced school services grant rate of €116.88 per pupil and additional school grants of up to €15,554 per school. For a school with 500 pupils, total current annual school funding towards general expenses and schools services support including secretarial and caretaking services now amounts to €236,761, €255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools.

The only instances where payments are made are: means tested maintenance grants for higher education and PLC students; training allowances paid to unemployed adults over 21 and at least six months unemployed under the vocational training opportunity scheme; training  allowances paid to early school leavers aged 15-20 in Youthreach and aged 15+ in senior traveller training centres, who left school with either minimal or no qualifications, generally less than five Ds at junior cycle level or equivalent.Approximately 6,000 part-time places have been provided in the further education sector this year under a new Back to Education initiative which is aimed at providing flexible learning opportunities for those in employment, unemployed or not in the labour market.

Information on Back to Education opportunities is available from the local vocational education committees.In addition to the above, my Department provides grants of order of €4 million per annum to vocational education committees to enable disadvantaged adults to avail of community education at minimal or no cost. This is usually allocated through the provision of teaching hours to a range of community and voluntary groups for educational activities. The special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme, SPIDAS, forms part of this grant, and enables vocational education committees to support disadvantaged students on a discretionary basis by providing funds towards the cost of fees, books, materials travel and meals. People who benefit from this scheme include, for example, participants in the Department of Social and Family Affairs back to education allowance scheme.Overall, there are of the order of one million Irish adults aged 15-64 with less than upper secondary education. The priority under the White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, is to widen access, increase flexibility and responsiveness, provide a national adult literacy strategy, and improve quality and supports such as guidance and childcare. Meeting these challenges will require considerable increases in investment on a phased basis. It is not possible in that context to expand the provision of financial support to students to a broader range of groups.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

To introduce free fees for all part-time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.With regard to the further education sector, 6,000 part-time places have been introduced under the Back to Education initiative this year, in order to promote increased flexibility and enable adults, particularly those with less than upper second level education, to combine a return to learning with work or family responsibilities. Under this initiative, tuition is free for holders of medical cards, unemployment payments, family income supplement or means-tested welfare payments and their dependants. There is a reduced charge for other unwaged categories with less than upper second level education, and the remainder pay fees. The impact of this on the participation of different groups will be monitored carefully.

In 1993 my Department issued, Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour, to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of  behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.Bullying is also addressed in the social, political and health education, SPHE, curriculum in both primary and second level education. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand, Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module, Belonging and Integrating.Furthermore, where staff within my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance is offered by staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter.The national educational psychological service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.

This amount excludes an allowance for additional family members attending approved courses.In relation to the 2002 income limits, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Accordingly, I approved an increase of 7% in the reckonable income limits for the 2002-03 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 2000 to March 2001, which was 6.7%.In the 2002 maintenance grants schemes, the reckonable income limit for the award of the full rate of maintenance grant where there are three dependent children is €21,629, £17,034, excluding the allowance(s) for additional family members attending approved courses.

The institutes of technology also levied a charge which varied from college to college. With the introduction of the free fees initiative the charge was standardised.The table below gives the amount of this charge since 1996.Students who are eligible for means tested student support will, in addition to any grant they are entitled to, have the €670 charge paid on their behalf, either directly by my Department or through the local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that 34% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.My Department does not hold information on the funding collected by the third level institutions in respect of this charge. Due regard is had to the expected income available to third level institutions when determining their annual grant.

One of the criteria under which appeals are to be considered is where the guidelines for maximum class sizes have been breached in the cases of schools in the Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle programmes. Henceforth all appeals on mainstream staffing in primary schools will only be considered by the independent appeals board.Giving Children An Even Break was initially launched in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.

Support in respect of transport and social outings was also sought.My Department's support package for July education programmes is available to all schools catering for children with severe/profound general learning disabilities who choose to extend their education services through the month of July. The package includes special nationally agreed rates of remuneration for teachers and special needs assistants involved in July programmes. Participating schools also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of pupils participating in the programme. Funding is also available to facilitate the provision of school transport and escort services for the children. All special schools were advised of the detailed funding arrangements applicable to July education programmes when the service was introduced in July, 2001.I understand that a copy of the claim form on which funding for July education programmes is based has been forwarded to St. Vincent's and that a response is awaited.

Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

Responsibility for ensuring that the various inputs are delivered in a co-ordinated manner rests with the local management authorities. The guiding principle informing such arrangements must be that the needs of the children are paramount and that they require and are entitled to a multi-disciplinary response involving educational and health care. In this regard, the education and health professionals assigned to work with the children need to make appropriate arrangements to meet the specific needs of each child at the centre.I am fully aware of the issue to which the Deputies refer and I am most anxious that this matter be resolved as speedily as possible. I have met with the parents involved and am aware of their concerns in relation to the matter.The issues involved have also been subject of high level discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children. Arising from these discussions a senior member of my Department's inspectorate and a representative of the Department of Health and Children have been appointed to visit the centre to review the situation and assist local management in resolving the current difficulty. These officials have already met with the parents of the children and are in ongoing discussions with the management authorities at the centre.I am hopeful that local management with the assistance of the officials referred to will secure an early resolution of the current difficulties.

Schools' authorities are authorised to appoint substitute teachers to replace teachers who are on approved absence, for example, due to illness, on school business etc. In the circumstances, subject to the availability of substitute teachers on a given day, the number of free classes arising from the absence of teachers should be minimal.Secondary schools are privately owned and managed institutions. Complaints such as those outlined should, in the first instance, be addressed by the parents to the principal of the school concerned. If they are unhappy with the response from the principal, the parents may contact the board of management in the matter.In exceptional cases, where issues remain unresolved and all local avenues of appeal have been exhausted, my Department may, on receipt of written authorisation from the parents, refer a complaint which it has received to the management authority of the school concerned for its observations. Following consideration of the school's response, the case may be referred to my Department's inspectorate for the purpose of making local inquiries. The outcome of my Department's investigations, when complete, is communicated to the parents.

My Department is working on a number of Bills at the moment. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will provide a statutory framework within which the education of children and people who have special educational needs because of disabilities can be guaranteed. A consultation process has now commenced on the basis of that Bill with a view to publishing a revised version by the end of this year.Preparation for a Bill concerning people who are considered unsafe to work with children is ongoing at the moment within my Department. The Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technologies (Amendment) Bill have as their goals the transfer of funding of the institutes of technology from my Department to the Higher Education Authority and to transfer responsibility for certain operational matters of the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority. Discussions are ongoing on this matter between my Department and the HEA.The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill will establish a statutory body which will oversee the development of a modern new campus at Grangegorman, Dublin for the Dublin Institute of Technology and for upgraded facilities of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Work on the drafting of the heads for this Bill is at an early stage.

Where architectural planning for a project has not yet commenced my Department will not be in a position, for financial reasons, to start the planning process, in the foreseeable future.My Department has an extensive primary school building programme for 2002 under way at present, details of which are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. Projects at schools referred to by the Deputy that are currently in architectural planning will not proceed to construction this year. Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction and projects at an advanced stage of architectural planning will be considered for inclusion in that programme. In the meantime, boards of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should therefore continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may apply to my Department's building unit for grant aid.

While my Department has recently made a number of new appointments of psychologists to NEPS, including some who will be based in the eastern region – south-western area – the situation will remain as previously outlined until the new staff are ready to take up work in the Kildare area. I am hopeful that it will be possible to extend the NEPS service to these schools during the current year but the exact timing will depend upon when the psychol ogists actually take up their posts and complete their induction training. In the meantime, the schools may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessment, details of which may be found on my Department's website.

To enable teachers, who had attempted to qualify as second level teachers of art through the technical schools examinations system but who had failed to do so, gain suitable recognised qualifications for the purposes of appointment as recognised teachers of art, my Department arranged for the provision of a suitable one-year course by the National College of Art and Design in the 2001-02 academic year.It is proposed to provide the course again in the current academic year. It is expected that the necessary advertisement inviting applications for admission to the course will be published in the near future. A teacher who successfully completes the course in question is recognised as fully qualified and may be appointed in a permanent capacity to a post as a teacher of art and paid at the appropriate point on the incremental salary scale for teachers.

This school will also be furnished and equipped to current standards at significant cost. The second level school building programme has expanded greatly in the past number of years. However, in addition to building new schools and extending existing schools in areas of increasing population, much of the available funding is being directed towards bringing existing school accommodation up to an acceptable standard and providing schools with the accommodation necessary to enable them to deliver the core curriculum to their pupils.For many years, this Department was not in a position to undertake a comprehensive programme of refurbishing, developing and, where necessary expanding, the second level school infrastructure. This has led to a position where many schools are urgently in need of significant capital expenditure, so that the demand for funding from the second level capital programme is very heavy.

I understand RTE services are available to a significant proportion of the population of Northern Ireland by means of over-spill of the analogue terrestrial signal from this State with some carriage by cable operators. The Broadcasting Act, 2001 includes a provision whereby I can require that a digital terrestrial television company in this State must carry those channels that are receivable throughout the whole of Northern Ireland on a free-to-air basis. This provision was included in the 2001 Act with a view to arriving at a situation in the future where, in a digital era, all channels available free-to-air on the island would be available throughout the entire island.

However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services due to lower population densities and lower concentrations of industries, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland and lower the cost differentials between the regions.In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled out broadband nationwide to a value – both public and private funding – of €70 million were supported and are now completed.

The appropriation account is a cash-based account providing details against the Estimate provision of actual payments made and receipts brought to account.While the cash basis is consistent with existing statutory requirements, most Departments have since 1994 provided some information of an accruals nature with the main appropriation accounts. The former Department of Public Enterprise provided full accrual accounts. As the Deputy is aware, the Department no longer exists and my Department was formed out of part of that Department together with the Department of Marine and Natural Resources and the broadcasting division of the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.

Broadleaf planting in 2001 was 18%. The 12.4% figure quoted is the total broadleaf planted by grant category. It does not for example include broadleaves planted under the 20% diverse conifer category or broadleaves planted for environmental or landscape reasons. When account is taken of these the correct figure for broadleaves planted in 2001 is 18%. As outlined in the rural development plan progress is being reviewed on a regular basis. In 2001 my Department launched the native woodland scheme and the neighbourwood scheme, both of which promote the planting of native broadleaf species.

Mineral exploration is conducted by private enterprise under prospecting licences under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. It is a high-risk activity which does not generate revenue in itself. The aim of mineral exploration is to discover mineral deposits which will be worth mining. It is not appropriate, therefore, to seek significant payments at the exploration stage which would only deter investors and divert funds from their proper use for investigation on the ground. However, fees levied under the Minerals Development Acts contribute significantly towards the cost of administering these licences.It is only on the rare occasions that such exploration is successful that any question arises regarding the generation of revenue to the State. Under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999, a separate permit is required before mining can take place. The financial terms of these state mining facilities – leases or licences, as the case may be – are set by individual negotiation as required by section 26(2)(a) of the 1940 Act, which states:

It was envisaged at that time that its work would take approximately 18 months. This period expired in September and I have been advised by Ms Dunne that, while the work of the inquiry is proceeding apace, it will take a considerable time for the inquiry to complete its work. An interim progress report was provided to me last Thursday by Ms Dunne and this is being considered by my Department.The inquiry is a non-statutory inquiry and it depends upon the voluntary co-operation of those involved in its work. The inquiry took the view from an early stage, that in these circumstances, it would be conducive to the success of its work if its proceedings were confidential and were not subject to dissemination publicly. Anyone contributing to the work of the inquiry is requested to enter into a written confidentiality agreement to treat as strictly private and confidential all information, given or received, relating to the work of the inquiry, whether written or oral. This undertaking is to ensure that the work of the inquiry will be totally private and confidential. The inquiry has advised me that it has received a satisfactory response to its request for this undertaking and has explained its reasons for seeking it to the persons concerned. The inquiry team does not believe that the undertaking would in any way limit or restrict the scope of the inquiry's work or its report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1281	Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health-related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. A sum of €14.6 million has been invested in these services nationally since 1998. In addition to this ring-fenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments using the resources allocated to the services.In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve a fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade.

Accordingly, the Deputies questions have been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputies as a matter of urgency. Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputies that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.

The association did not receive any funding from the other health boards. My Department has not given funding direct to the Motor Neurone Disease Association. However, €48,000 was allocated in 2002 to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the purpose of assisting the association.The provision of additional funding to organisations providing health services for people with disabilities is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. Any application for funding to a health board is entirely a matter for the relevant health board, in this case the South-Eastern Health Board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the final matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.

The group was set up to advise on proposals for the future of the Central Mental Hospital in the context of national and regional services provided by the hospital, linkages with community psychiatric services, linkages with the criminal justice system, legislation, the training role of the Central Mental Hospital for medical, nursing and paramedical staff and future accommodation and resource requirements. The group has now concluded its work and its report was submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children in 2002.The report includes plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building and to provide a new residence on the campus. Overall capacity would increase from 90 to 120. The Minister for Health and Children has accepted, in principle, the main thrust of the report of the review group and is establishing a special project team, representative of all the main stakeholders, including the Irish Prison Service, to progress the matter as quickly as possible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1286	There is no universally accepted policy for  screening children with autism for a variety of hypothetical disorders. The quality standards sub-committee of the American Academy of Neurology – approved 9 June 2000 – states as regards diagnostic testing:There is inadequate supporting evidence for hair analysis, coeliac antibodies, allergy testing (particularly food allergies for gluten, casein, candida and other molds), immunologic or neurochemical abnormalities, micronutriants such as vitamin levels, intestinal permeability studies, stool analysis, urinary peptides, mitochondrial disorders (including lactate and pyruvate), thyroid function tests, or erythrocyte flurathione peroxidase studies.As with all areas of medical practice, however, continuous evaluation of emerging evidence is undertaken by practitioners and new diagnostic tests of proven value are constantly being added to the range of tests already available across the entire spectrum of medical practice. My Department, together with the relevant professional bodies, regularly reviews progress in this and other areas of medical practice.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1287	Delegation of ministerial functions orders are being prepared at present and will go to Government in the next two weeks. These orders will devolve the statutory powers for child care services to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan; services for older people to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely; and mental health services, services for people with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and responsibility for food safety to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1288	The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable –€114.30, €152.40, €190.50 –  in accordance with three levels of dependency – medium, high, maximum – which are eligible for subvention.As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.In 1997, the funding available for the scheme was £27 million; in 2001, the sum was £52 million; and in 2002 the funding available is £72 million-€91.4 million. In recognition of the issues involved, my Department made significant additional resources of over £1.2 million €1.5 million available to the Southern Health Board at the end of 2001.The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with sections 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. This solution involves the payment of enhanced subventions on quite a significant scale. In this context it should be noted that the Southern Health Board received an additional €4.24 million this year including a sum of €2.641 million to respond to extra pressures on the scheme.In relation to the case mentioned by the Deputy, as responsibility for the provision of health services in the Cork area rests with the Southern Health Board, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.

The NTPF was set up in April and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months. The patients' consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment.

I am pleased to report that considerable preparatory work has already been completed ahead of the commencement of lung transplantation in Ireland. The final report of the expert consultative group, established to advise my Department on the many issues associated with the development of this complex programme, was received in recent weeks by my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. This submission is being examined as a priority within my Department.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that revenue funding in excess of €3 million has already been provided to support the enhancement of lung transplant services for Irish patients, including the appointment of key transplant personnel to this new programme.In terms of the timescale for the introduction of the programme I am advised that the Mater Hospital proposes to commence lung transplantation over the coming weeks. The resource requirements for the programme are being progressed in the context of the 2003 Estimates process.Pending the establishment of lung transplantation in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients. To date 24 patients from this country have received a transplant at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.Finally, it is also important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients.

Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.Motorised Transport Grant:The purpose of this allowance is to provide financial assistance to persons with a severe disability who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or to provide financial assistance to persons with a severe disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the disabled person to obtain-retain employment or have transport requirements because of very isolated circumstances.Applications may also be considered in the cases of persons with severe disabilities, who are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from work. Consideration might be given for the purpose of the scheme to award a grant for the purchase of a car in the name of the person with the disability subject to the understanding that he or she will be driven by another person, whose name will be notified to the health board, to and from his-her place of employment. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1311	The Department of Health and Children recognises the importance of introducing measures to prevent eating disorders. In relation to public information measures, the health promotion unit of my Department has published a leaflet on eating disorders in association with BODYWHYS a support organisation for persons with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. This leaflet is available through the Department of Health and Children and health boards nationwide.In relation to preventative measures The National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-05 has as one of its key objectives to promote healthy eating habits and a healthy body image among school going-children and young people. The health promotion unit of my Department, the community nutrition and dietetic services in health boards, and the schools health promotion teams have been working together to draw up "Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Schools" which will be available before the end of the year. My Department has invested heavily in community nutrition and dietetic services in health boards and in schools health promotion officers in the last five years to help influence and encourage healthy eating behaviours especially in children. Community dietitians also work in the general practice setting, and therefore are more accessible to work with people with eating disorders. Another key objective in the national health promotion strategy 2000-05 is to work in partnership with the Department of Education and Science to support the implementation of the social, personal and health education curriculum in all schools consistent with the health promoting school concept. The health promotion unit is working with the Department of Education and Science to draw up appropriate nutrition education tools for schools.Other healthy eating initiatives for schools include the healthy school lunch policy and the attitude and behavioural programme – nutrition education at primary schools and the Department of Health and Children's participation in the recent review of the school meals scheme.The health behaviour in school-aged children surveys, 1997-8 and currently, carried out every four years also provide important research information which helps inform nutrition and other lifestyle behaviour programmes undertaken by my Department.

However, I understand that one of the priorities for the commission over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals. The mental health tribunals, operating under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission, will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention. The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention-extension order being signed. As part of the review process the mental health tribunal will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist and the commission will also operate a scheme to provide legal aid to patients whose detention is being reviewed by a tribunal.The Mental Health Commission will also appoint an inspector of mental health services which will replace the existing office of the inspector of mental hospitals. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The Minister will be empowered to make regulations specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres and these will be enforced by the inspector. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published along with the commission's annual report.The commission will also be required to put in place a system of registration of approved centres, as provided for in Part V of the Act. Section 72 of the Act provides for the temporary registration of existing centres for three years, to allow the Commission time to establish the new system.

There is specific mention of this programme in the Health Strategy with a stated objective to complete the overall transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals in all health board regions as soon as possible and not later than 2006. My Department will be working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to achieve this objective.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1317	The Social Services Inspectorate was established in April 1999, initially on an administrative basis but it is proposed to establish it on a statutory basis. The main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards. The SSI will monitor all personal social services operated by the health boards, in the longer term, but initially it is concentrating on the child care area and in particular on the inspection of health board operated residential child care facilities. The inspection process is intended to act as a catalyst for improvement and inspections play an essential safeguarding role and are just one part of ensuring quality services for vulnerable children.A steering group chaired by the Department of Health and Children and comprising representatives of the Department, the chief executive officers of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief inspector of the SSI oversees the operation of the SSI. The process of inspection has been agreed. A national set of standards against which all children's residential homes both statutory and non-statutory, are being inspected was published in September 2001. A set of standards for the special care units has also issued.An inspection of a special care unit highlighted the area of single separation as one where there is a need for guidelines. As a result my Department has established a working group to develop guidelines on the use of single separation. These guidelines will be finalised shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1318	The position is that the setting of premium charges is the responsibility of the VHI board. The legislation requires the board to set premiums at a level sufficient to cover costs and make allowance for reserves. The board is, however, obliged to notify me in advance of putting proposed increases into effect. I may prevent the introduction of an increase, but must have good reasons for doing so.Regarding the board's decision concerning a recent premium increase of 18%, the details provided by VHI in support of the need for such a level of increase were carefully examined. A key piece of information in the consideration process is the trend of likely claims which VHI will have to pay for on behalf of members. The forecast figures given by VHI in that regard strongly supported the need for such an increase. The trend in claims reflect high increases, both, in the price of medical services to members and the volume of claims by members.On the basis of the information put before me, I formed the view that the board's decision was in accordance with its legal duty in setting premium charges. In that connection, I considered that it would be unrealistic to veto the increase involved, while expecting VHI to meet the needs of its members, in terms of benefits and coverage, together with maintaining the integrity of its finances.The rate of increase in medical inflation is not comparable to the rate of increase in the consumer price index. This has been the experience in other countries also. VHI is obliged to incorporate into its premium increases a broad range of continuously evolving factors including, claims volume increases, new technology, new treatments, drugs etc, which are not captured by a standardised measure of inflation, such as the CPI.I would, of course, prefer if annual increases in VHI premiums in excess of the CPI rate of inflation could be avoided. However, the additional income yielded is primarily spent in meeting the cost of ensuring that the best care is provided for all VHI subscribers, and that VHI will continue to be in a position to fund such care on behalf of their members.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1319	The White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in 1999, set out the Government's proposals regarding the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The White Paper provided for the establishment of the VHI as a company under the Companies Acts, with full commercial freedom of operation, in the ownership of the Minister for Finance. The possibility of third party investment and eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable by the Government, were also addressed.Further to the provisions of the White Paper, corporate finance consultants were appointed to examine and report on strategic options for the VHI. The consultants have now completed their report and it is currently under consideration. Ultimately, it will be a matter for the Government, having regard to all the relevant factors, to prepare the course of action that will best serve the interests of VHI customers, the company's competitive capacity and the wider health insurance market into the future. As any change of status for VHI will require legislation, the Oireachtas will have the final say on the course to be pursued.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1321	Currently, there is a statutory charge of €40 for attendance at accident and emergency departments. This charge is levied only on persons who attend accident and emergency departments without a referral note from their doctor, and applies only for the first visit of any episode of care. The charge does not apply to the following groups: medical card holders, persons admitted to hospital as a result of attending the A & E department, persons receiving treatment for prescribed infectious diseases, children up to six weeks of age, children suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities, and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations, women receiving maternity services.The A & E charge is based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services. The income raised from the charge represents a valuable source of finance for our public hospitals and is important as an incentive towards the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.This year, almost €8.2 billion is being invested in our health service – this represents an increase of 16% over 2001, and an overall increase of 134% since 1997.Gross non-capital health expenditure now stands at 7.8% of GNP, the highest level in almost twenty years. Furthermore, when you look at the last four years, it can be seen that the rate of increase in gross non-capital health expenditure has been outstripping the rate of increase in GNP by an average of 10% each year.These figures demonstrate the clear and sustained commitment of this Government since first coming into office in 1997 to bring investment in the health services to a level never previously occurring in this country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1325	Responsibility for the provision of services for the elderly in the areas of Dublin 3, 5 and 9 rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. I am advised by the authority that a number of initiatives have been implemented during the year to enhance the delivery of services to the elderly in the Northern Area Health Board region which includes the area of Dublin 3, 5 and 9.The services catered for under the 2002 provider plan include community support services, home first, home care funding, the North Inner City Partnership and the provision of grants to voluntary organisations.The authority hopes to further improve community support services by providing: Alzheimer's day services at Sybil Hill, Raheny, a day care centre in St. Monica's, Belvedere Place, further respite beds in Clontarf orthopaedic hospital and by increasing the funding to home help organisations to allow for more comprehensive services.The home first project allows older people to remain in their own homes or return home from hospital with a comprehensive range of services. The project is being expanded at Beaumont Hospital to cater for additional clients. The project is also being extended to the Mater Hospital. I am informed by the authority that this will allow up to 30 clients to be discharged from the hospital setting.Home care funding is being provided to individuals to fund home care assisting. This allows older people to remain at home in line with their assessed needs.The North Inner City GP Partnership development has led to the appointment of two nurses and one social worker to work as links between GPs, community services and geriatric services in the Mater Hospital.In order to assist and maintain older residents at home with the appropriate community support the authority has entered into partnership and allocated funds to various voluntary organisations for the provision of a range of projects for older people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1326	An issue which has received considerable publicity recently is the deaths of children in circumstances of huge family turmoil, where separation seems to be one of a number of distressing factors. At the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs last year, the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced proposals to prioritise funding for research on how services can better respond to families in crisis and what measures can be put in place to prevent families falling into extreme distress, under the families research programme.I understand that this research is being commissioned under the new funding round of the families research programme. Meanwhile contacts are being made at official level with State bodies, research institutions and universities both at home and abroad to learn more about the experience of dealing with families in crisis and to gather the available research on this theme. This information, together with the views of Irish experts working in this field, will help to shape the terms of reference and focus the proposed research appropriately. The Department of Social and Family Affairs will be liaising with the national children's office in progressing the research project.I have no plans to empanel a child death review committee at present and will await the outcome of the research before deciding on future policy in this important and complex area.
Question No. 943 answered with Question No. 888.




#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1327	MMR vaccine is available under the childhood immunisation programme and I have no plans to introduce any change to the programme in relation to this vaccine. The childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious  infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The MMR vaccine is given by a single injection and not by three injections as suggested in the question.The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, USA, and the American Academy of Paediatrics.Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed some 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease.Earlier this year newspaper articles alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism referred to a study by Professor John O'Leary into the measles virus. In response to these articles Professor O'Leary issued a statement indicating that the research referred to in no way establishes any link between the vaccine and autism. He further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccine to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella.MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a 2-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved.

That meeting took place on 22 May 2002 at which the report was discussed. The Diabetes Federation of Ireland was informed that the report would be considered in the context of the current health strategy Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You and within the limits of available funding.The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, made a number of recommendations on the prevention of heart disease, many of these are also relevant to the prevention of diabetes. The strategy recommends the expansion of primary prevention initiatives to reduce the development of risk factors, and related diseases such as diabetes, in the population. Awareness of the need to adopt a more healthy lifestyle was one of the main objectives of the first phase of the heart health campaign, Ireland needs a Change of Heart.A combination of primary prevention in the general population and secondary prevention in those known to have heart disease, as outlined in Building Healthier Hearts, can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of heart disease, including in patients with related conditions such as diabetes in the coming years.A sum of €45 million has been allocated to the strategy since its launch. To date almost 800 new posts have been being created to support and implement the strategy. Four out of five of these are professional staff and include: smoking cessation officers, nutritionists, physical activity co-ordinators, public health nurses, cardiac nursing staff, cardiac rehabilitation co-ordinators, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, resuscitation training officers, cardiac technicians and research and information officers.

A total of €17.2 million was made available in 2002 alone for the development of out of hours co-operatives, of which €2.59 million was allocated to the Southern Health Board. All decisions in relation to the geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and the order of their commencement are matters for the relevant health board to make, having due regard to the range of financial and other issues involved. My Department will pursue the continuing expansion of co-operatives in 2003 in the context of the Estimates process.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1356	The Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act, 2002, was enacted on 1 May 2002. This Act required the Medical Council to draft new rules governing applications for full registration on the general register of medical practitioners. These rules have been drafted by the Medical Council under the provisions of the Act and these have been submitted by the council to me for approval.Following their careful consideration in my Department, I have recently written to the council seeking clarification on certain specific points. As these rules will have important consequences for the registration of doctors in this country, I wish to ensure that I am fully satisfied in relation to their appropriateness. I understand that arrangements are being made to meet with the Medical Council in this regard and I expect these rules to be finalised following these discussions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1357	I am concerned by the long delays experienced by some women waiting for a routine smear test result. I am advised that current waiting times for such results vary depending on the laboratory and can range from periods of three weeks up to those referred to by the Deputy. However, where cervical smears are urgent, results are available within a fortnight in the majority of cases; in a minority of instances, the waiting time can extend to four weeks.My Department is committed to facilitating a reduction in waiting times for routine smear test results. To this end, additional funding has been provided over the last few years for the development of cervical cytology laboratories in terms of additional staffing, equipment and the introduction of new technology. Furthermore, my Department has recently approved the piloting of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of the analysis of cervical smears to a laboratory abroad subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the December 1999 document, Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish National Cervical Screening Programme.Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The experience gained from phase one of the national programme in the Mid-Western Health Board area should be of assistance in the context of implementing this commitment. The process of planning and organising the national programme is, of course, a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that requires careful consideration. Accordingly, following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. I understand the chief executive officers will report on the outcome of the examination soon.

The group has identified two broad areas of co-operation: local cross-Border collaboration, covering hospitals in the Border areas, and wider co-operation on a regional and supra-regional basis, covering specialist services which are or could only be viable where delivered on an all-island basis.The work of the group is being informed by, inter alia, the acute hospitals review group report on acute health services in Northern Ireland. While this group was primarily tasked with the remit of examining and making recommendations on the profile of acute health services in Northern Ireland, it also outlines the potential for increased co-operation both at local and all-island level.The NSRHSG includes in its membership a senior representative of the North Eastern Health Board. Any proposals emerging from the work of the NSRHSG, and which are designed to further advance co-operation between the North Eastern Health Board and Northern Ireland in the provision of hospital services, will fall to be considered by the food safety and health sector of the North South Ministerial Council.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1375	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Western Health Board area.The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards – including the Western Health Board – for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Two dentists from the Western Health Board have recently completed their specialist in orthodontics training and have taken up duty. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The additional funding of €0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes €0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. Under the initiative, the board has recruited an additional specialist in orthodontics and engaged the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat cases.

In early July 2002, I was advised by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, that a single batch of BCG vaccine, batch number 761641, manufactured by Evans Vaccines Limited was being recalled due to the possibility of reduced effectiveness. This was a precautionary measure following tests which showed that this batch of vaccine, distributed in Ireland since March 2002, was found to be less potent than that which is normally administered. All stock from this batch was withdrawn at this time and is no longer in use. This withdrawal took place under the direction and supervision of the IMB. For precautionary reasons, the use of other batches of Evans BCG vaccine, five in total, was deferred pending testing and confirmation of their effectiveness.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1399	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1024, 1073, 1075, 1115, and 1141 together.I presume the Deputies are referring to the drugs payment scheme, DPS, introduced on 1 July 1999. The DPS replaced both the drug cost subsidisation, DCSS, and drugs refund schemes, DRS, and provided that families only have to meet the first €53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was €40.63 a month per individual, and for the DRS it was €114.28 a quarter for each eligible person. Under the DRS, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter.The DPS has brought about important improvements over the previous schemes. It is more user friendly, and it significantly improves cash flow for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. The DPS also removes anomalies where, for example, a family spending €100 in one month on medicines and nothing for the rest of the quarter would not get a refund. Families can now budget for medicine costs, as they only pay up to the threshold amount in any month, and no longer have to pay first and then claim a refund quarterly. Also, there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS, unlike the DCSS, which required a doctor's certificate and health board approval as having a long-term medical condition with regular and continuous prescribed drugs over €40.63 a month.The aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was £75 million, the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention to patients was £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to £140 million in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years.The DPS was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced. Regulations fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33 per month could have been made in July 1999 under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, but, as Government approval had been obtained to amend that section, it was decided to defer making the regulations until the Act was actually amended. At the time it was envisaged that the amending provision would be enacted very quickly. Subsequently, however, difficulties and delays arose in securing drafting time and parliamentary time for the new legislation. Following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General in October 2000, regulations to fix the threshold at €53.33 per month were put in place under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act in March 2001.

Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients.The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment in the target specialties has decreased by 20% between December 2000 and March 2002.In the period March 2001 to March 2002 there has been a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for ENT procedures, and a fall of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002.The health strategy places a new focus on waiting times. While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year.

One of the objectives set out in this strategy is the establishment of implementation projects, which will involve putting in place, in a number of locations around the country, the team-based primary care model described in the strategy. Proposals in this regard were invited from each health board and one of the proposals from the Western Health Board involved the establishment of a primary care team in Tuam. The costings submitted indicated that the annual revenue costs were estimated by the health board at €1.2 million, while the proposed capital development was costed at approximately €5.7 million. The proposal was for the delivery of primary care services by a multi-disciplinary team and network in the manner described in the strategy.The level of resources available in the current year for the implementation of the primary care strategy would not allow this capital project to be funded at present. The matter will be kept under consideration in the light of available resources and the primary care development priorities identified by the Western Health Board.

Under these regulations, moneys left to meet a person's personal needs are a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship.

Paragraph 2 of the second schedule provides that, in calculating the means of an applicant, a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including income from rentals. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.

The future provision and extent of paediatric surgery services was reviewed in 1998 by a committee established by Comhairle. The committee was asked to consider this issue in the absence of agreement among the three paediatric hospitals on the nature and structure of a replacement consultant paediatric surgeon post which had arisen at Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin. Comhairle recommended the concentration of a very small number of specialist paediatric and neonatal surgical operations in Our Lady's hospital, Crumlin, with all three paediatric hospitals continuing to provide non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology services.I am advised by Comhairle that a very small percentage of the children undergoing paediatric surgical procedures at Temple Street would require access to the specialist surgical services under consideration. However, I am aware that concerns have been raised by Temple Street Hospital in relation to the proposed transfer of this work. In this regard I will be meeting with representatives from the hospital in the near future to discuss these concerns. With regard to Deputy Bruton's question concerning services for patients being treated for spina bifida and hydrocephalus at Temple Street Hospital, my Department has asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.

Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. As the determination of eligibility is a matter for the chief executive officers, I have requested that the chief executive officer of the Health Board Executive, HeBE, reply directly to you on this matter.

Screening is being offered free of charge to all those women in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age. The programme is on target to complete phase one by December 2002. Up to the end of July 2002, 92,400 women have been called for screening and 65,011 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. This year, additional funding of €1.5 million was provided to BreastCheck for the continued development of the national breast screening programme, bringing the total allocation to date to €8.7 million. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. BreastCheck has submitted a business plan for the extension of the programme, which is currently being examined by my Department.Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in the area concerned. In relation to the Western Health Board, the board's policy is to provide services for women with breast cancer in UCHG and at Mayo General Hospital. The regional breast cancer team is located at UCHG while a breast cancer centre is located at Mayo General Hospital. In November 2001, financial approval issued for the following consultant posts with sessional splits between UCHG and Mayo General Hospital: consultant surgeon with a special interest in breast cancer; consultant radiologist with a special interest in breast cancer; and consultant histopathologist with a special interest in breast cancer. Currently there are three locations in the Western Health Board where mammography takes place. These locations and their activity are detailed in the following table:

This is a monthly allowance paid by health boards. It provides financial support to the carers of eligible children up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained on a full time basis in special or residential institutions. However, the allowance may be paid on a pro-rata basis for the number of nights spent at home, e.g. during weekends or holidays, by eligible children who attend special or residential institutions.To be eligible to receive this allowance, applicants must satisfy the following conditions: they must be under 16 years of age; the disability must be so severe that they require from another person constant care or supervision, i.e. continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age; the constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by arrangement by them with another person or persons; the disability must be present at the time of the application and be likely to last for at least a year; where medical confirmation is supplied which pre-dates the actual date of application and the health board is satisfied that the child requires continual care and attention substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age, then payment may be made from the date of medical confirmation.Only the means of the child should be taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance – the means of the parents should not be considered. "Means" in this context includes payments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained. Where there is more than one eligible child in a family, a full DCA payment should be made in respect of each eligible child. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, e.g. if the child's condition improves, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility.

The UK authorities have extended the residence conditions that had previously applied  to other students to those applying to study nursing and midwifery at DipHE level.This means that to qualify for support under the new terms of the NHS bursary scheme those applying for diploma level courses will have to have been ordinarily resident in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man throughout the three years preceding the first day of the first academic year of the course, other than for the purpose of receiving full-time education; have settled status in the UK within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971 on the first day of the first academic year of the course; and be ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of the first academic year of the course.There are a number of exceptions to these criteria. (I) Migrant workers from within the European Economic Area who have taken up residence and employment in the UK and have been ordinarily resident in the EEA for the three years preceding the first day of the first academic year of the course, other than for the purpose of receiving full-time education, will remain eligible for the bursary and tuition fees. The EEA is defined as the European Community and, subject to the conditions laid down in the EEA agreement, the area comprised by Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, including Svalbard. (II) Applicants from within the EU, but not the wider EEA, who do not meet the foregoing criteria will not be eligible for the NHS bursary. They will however receive tuition fee support. (III) Special arrangements apply to refugees, individuals granted exceptional leave to enter or remain in the UK, and UK nationals absent from the UK due to temporary employment abroad.Applicants who do not meet the foregoing residence criteria and who fall outside the exceptions defined at (I)-(III), will not be eligible for NHS bursary support. Diploma course students who meet the residence criteria will continue to receive the non-means tested bursary.The effect of these changes is to harmonise the rules for NHS funded students studying at degree and DipHE level. It brings diploma level students into line with all other students in higher education in the UK.

At present, the board is experi encing unprecedented demand for home help services, particularly in County Mayo. However, despite this increased demand, the level of service being provided in County Mayo in 2002 is significantly greater than in previous years, in response to assessed need.

I am aware of the difficulties being encountered in the eastern region, that a significant proportion of those awaiting placement in residential services in the region are associated with St. Michael's House services and the consequential need for continued investment in these services in the eastern region and in other health board areas.I assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to fulfilling the commitment it gave to meeting the needs of this population group, as outlined in the programme for Government.

In line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on CE schemes are being mainstreamed. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools. It is estimated that there are in the region of 4,000 places in the area of health and personal social services, including services for people with disabilities, suitable for mainstreaming.My Department supports the mainstreaming of these services in view of its potential to create more permanent funding for the delivery of such services in the future. The allocation of funds to specific service providers will, thereafter, be a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1453	The National Centre for Medical Genetics based at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, was set up in 1995, following the Report of the Department of  Health Committee to examine Medical Genetics Services – the 1990 "Tierney" report. The NCMG is charged with providing a clinical and laboratory genetic service for the country as a whole. The NCMG provides a wide range of laboratory cytogenetic and molecular genetic tests.Cytogenetic tests are carried out for constitutional chromosome disorders such as Down Syndrome, and are also carried out to help in the diagnosis and management of non-hereditary cancers, particularly leukaemia. For genetic tests not offered by the NCMG, the centre can arrange for such tests to be carried out by other laboratories in Europe. The centre does not charge public patients, hospitals or health boards for the costs of genetic tests carried out in the centre. Where a genetic test is carried out by an external genetics laboratory abroad, the cost of that test is passed back to the referring clinician and hospital.The remit of the NMCG is principally the diagnosis, management, and counselling of families with genetic disorders, including describing genetic testing for genes involved in hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer – BRCA1 and BRCA2.Genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes falls into two categories, namely, finding a DNA mutation in a blood sample from a person affected by a cancer which is likely to be hereditary – diagnostic genetic testing; and testing healthy unaffected members of a family where a causative gene mutation has already been found – predictive genetic testing.A diagnostic test identifies a family with hereditary breast cancer and can allow predictive testing for healthy family members. A predictive test can be highly indicative of a person's risk of developing cancer.The department of medical genetics of University College Dublin, based at the NCMG, was awarded funding by the Health Research Board in 1998 to carry out a collaborative four year study on the implementation of testing for hereditary breast cancer in Ireland. This study has established the technology and expertise for screening for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the NCMG, and has provided important information about the frequency of particular breast cancer gene mutations in the Irish population. The study also established expertise in Ireland in assessing and counselling families with hereditary breast cancer.The National Cancer Forum has recently established a sub-group on genetics to report to the forum with specific proposals for the further development and support of cancer genetics in the country. The work of this sub-group will inform the development of the National Cancer Strategy 2003-2010.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1454	In June 2000, in response to the work of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services, which highlighted acute shortages of trained psychology personnel, my Department indicated to the existing providers ofpostgraduate training that, subject to certain strict conditions, it was prepared to offer funding to health agencies to support the provision of additional postgraduate psychology training places tocommence in the academic year 2000-01.In September 2000, a bidding process involving health agencies was initiated by the Department for the provision of the increased places as soon as possible, following which a commitment for funding was given in November 2001 to the successful applicants for the creation of 30 trainee clinical psychologist posts and for the payment of course fees of €2,540.Given the urgency of providing the additional training places, all the increased training places were allocated to the Psychological Society of Ireland's postgraduate diploma course for a period of three years since the other existing training providers were not in a position at that time to provide the places within the required timeframe.In August 2002 the Northern Area Health Board applied for additional funding to be made available to support the provision of six extra places on the TCD programme. As the substantial funding allocated by my Department currently supporting the extra 30 PSI training places has been distributed to those agencies who participated in the bidding process in 2000, this request is being examined in the context of the 2003 funding position. My Department is continuing to work with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to ensure adequate provision of training places consistent with the human resource requirements of the health services.

The Commission recommended that in "light of services offered by public health nurses and the on-going development of nursing and midwifery services in the community, registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing. An alternative education programme relating more closely to the core generic maternal and child care services requirements of public health nursing should replace the mandatory midwifery requirement."The Commission went on to recommend that An Bord Altranais "establish a working party composed of PHN's, health service providers and nurse educators to determine the content and duration of a course in maternal and child health as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification." Following this recommendation, An Bord Altranais established a working party which reported in June 2002. The group produced a document detailing the content and duration of a proposed course in Maternal and Child Health. The changes have been agreed by An Bord Altranais. The board has now requested that the Nurses' Rules be amended to give effect to the proposed changes.

In response to my concern regarding the current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nation-wide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, including occupational therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015, was published on 25 July 2001.The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for occupational therapy. I am therefore working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA.In terms of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, is currently implementing the national physical and sensory disability database, which, when complete, will provide an accurate picture of the service requirements, including the requirements for people with dyspraxia, in the sector.

A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products. The current agreement has been extended to mid-2005.Under the general medical services scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price of the drug plus an agreed dispensing fee. In the case of private prescriptions reimbursed under the drug payment scheme, the State reimburses the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost – normally 50% of the trade price – and a standard dispensing fee. My Department has no function in relation to the retail mark-up on private dispensing, which has been established by custom and practice over the years.The sourcing and purchase of drugs and medicines for use in hospitals is a matter for the individual hospital having regard to suitable available alternatives and the maximum prices as set out in the agreement between the Department and the pharmaceutical industry.

The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies, including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.The schedule of immunisation for the childhood immunisation programme is based on the recommendations and expert advice of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee is made up of experts from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.Extensive research has and continues to be conducted world-wide in relation to the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, USA and the American Academy of Paediatrics. Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced.

This was a precautionary measure following tests which showed that this batch of vaccine, distributed in Ireland since March 2002, was found to be less potent than that which is normally administered. All stock from this batch was withdrawn at this time and is no longer in use. This withdrawal took place under the direction and supervision of the IMB. For precautionary reasons, the use of other batches of Evans BCG vaccine – five in total – was deferred pending testing and confirmation of their effectiveness.Following this withdrawal, the IMB carried out an on-site investigation of Evans Vaccines facility in the UK; the IMB was dissatisfied with the procedures adopted by the company in producing the BCG vaccine and, as a result of this, on 31 July 2002 the IMB suspended the BCG licence held by Evans Vaccines Limited. Alternative effective supplies of BCG vaccine were secured from Statens Serum Institute, Denmark, and these have been distributed to health boards.In August 2002, the IMB advised me that following testing of the other five batches manufactured by Evans Vaccines Limited, a further batch of BCG vaccine, batch number 754576, was also found to be sub-potent. This batch was distributed in Ireland between April 2000 and July 2002. The IMB confirmed that the four other batches tested met the licensed potency specification required.The IMB has assured me that there is no health threat to persons who received BCG vaccine from either batch 761641 or 754576 other than the fact they may not have received immunity from the vaccine. Health boards were asked to identify those who have received vaccine from the two batches concerned, to contact those involved and to make arrangements to examine those who received the vaccine in order to determine whether or not the vaccine was effective at the time it was administered. If it emerges that the vaccine was ineffective, revaccination will be offered. A period of three months must elapse after the BCG vaccine is given before the effectiveness of the vaccine can be determined.

In accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, priorities for the allocation of available funding for the development of health related services for the sector are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees. The Post Polio Support Group is represented at the co-ordinating committees by its umbrella organisation, the Disability Federation of Ireland.Officials from my Department recently met with the Post Polio Support Group. A number of issues were raised which my Department will examine further, following which contact will be made directly with the organisation in due course.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1485	Provision of health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with post-polio syndrome, is a matter for the health boards. The boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support and personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.Significant additional funding of over €179 million has been provided by the Government since 1997. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes: approximately €35 million for aids and appliances; approximately €76 million for the development of services, including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services; €36 million for capital projects; a significant proportion of the remainder allocated in support of voluntary sector service providers.People suffering from one of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain drugs and medicines without charge for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness (under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.

In this context, the Midland Health Board was requested to achieve savings of €0.55 million from an adjustment in planned employment growth. All of the health boards were informed by my Department that the adjustment in employment growth was to be undertaken in a way so as to have minimum impact on new and existing services. As responsibility for the precise measures to be taken to yield the planned result in both service and cost terms rests with the chief executive officer of each health board, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board to supply the information requested by the Deputy to him directly.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1517	It is the policy of the South-Eastern Health Board's child care and family services to respond to all referrals to it of children who are in need of care and/or protection under the terms of the Child Care Act, 1991. The board's ability to respond quickly and fully to such referrals is influenced by staffing levels at any time in its front line child protection services. I understand from the board that staffing levels in the Waterford Community Care Social Work Department have been below its authorised complement for most of 2002. A recent recruitment drive by the South-Eastern Health Board has led to offers of social work positions in Waterford being made to seven successful applicants whose appointments are now being processed in relation to medical reports, references and Garda clearance. The employment of seven new staff will relieve the pressure on the Social Work Department in Waterford and will allow for a speedier and a fuller response to be made to all referrals of children whose situations come within the terms of the Child Care Act, 1991.The chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board has informed me that he is not aware of any particular child with chronic anti-social behaviour and associated parental neglect being referred by another statutory agency to Waterford community care services, whose case has not been responded to. However, if the Deputy has specific concerns in relation to a particular child he can bring these to the immediate attention of the manager of community care services at the SEHB community care centre at Cork Road, Waterford.

While particular difficulties have been experienced in delivering services at local level, there has been no reduction in the level of resources available from the health services to support the children attending the developmental education centre.My colleagues, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, the Ministers of State at my Department, Deputy Tim O'Malley and Deputy Brian Lenihan, have met representatives of the parents and officials from my Department have been in contact with the management of the centre. Local management has been endeavouring to resolve the difficulties and this process is ongoing. The Ministers agreed that the Departments would nominate two people with relevant professional experience in this area to provide whatever assistance they can to local management in the matter. The two people nominated by the Departments met representatives of the families last night and will be meeting representatives of other relevant groups later this week.I once again appeal to all involved in the delivery of services to these children to ensure that the needs of the children are met by the most appropriate application of the health and educational resources available to the service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1520	As the Deputy is aware, the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, the O'Higgins report, was published in March 2000 and contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country, and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment which is needed for such specialist units. The report also makes recommendations regarding the siting of such units in each health board area. The report recommends that women with breast cancer are best served by a team of specialists working together and that women experience better outcomes if their cancer is managed in centres developed along the lines of the sub-group report. The modern management of breast cancer entails triple assessment, which involves the surgeon, pathologist and radiologist being in the clinic together. The report recommends that specialist breast units should be based on a population of 250,000 to 300,000 from which it is expected that there will be a minimum of 100 new primary breast cancers per annum.Since the publication of the O'Higgins report, there have been extensive consultations between my Department and the health boards in relation to the best way forward for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in their functional areas. Financial approval to the boards' proposals has been given on condition that they operate to agreed protocols and standards of care in accordance with national guidelines and quality assurance arrangements to ensure compliance with best international practice and to achieve optimum outcomes.A total of €5.2 million was allocated between health boards in 2001 specifically for the development of symptomatic breast disease services. An additional sum of €23.55 million was allocated in 2002 for the ongoing development of cancer services, including symptomatic breast disease services and during 2001 and 2002, financial approval has issued for nine consultant posts for symptomatic breast disease services across a number of health boards.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1530	I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that there are currently 19 applications on the waiting list for inter-country adoption assessment and three applications on the waiting list for domestic adoption in Kerry. The number of domestic adoptions, other than family adoptions, has decreased enormously in recent years. In 2000 only six adoption orders were made by the Adoption Board for children placed with families by the Southern Health Board. The reduction in domestic adoptions reflects the decrease in the number of children available for adoption.Agencies and health boards generally assess a small number of couples based on their estimate of the number of children likely to become available for adoption. There is no guarantee that a couple on the domestic waiting list will ever have a child placed with them. Assessments are carried out as the need arises and health boards normally advise couples where the chance of a domestic placement is low. I understand that some couples then opt to be assessed for inter-country adoption instead.

However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1534	The Government decision to extend automatic medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 and over with effect from 1 July 2000 was announced on budget day in December 2000. The measure was subsequently unanimously approved by this House. It was originally estimated that 39,000 persons would benefit from the initiative. This was based on the CSO estimate of persons aged 70 and over in the State less the number in that age category already registered as medical cardholders.However, it subsequently came to light that the health board/GMS databases of medical cardholders in the over 70s age category were inaccurate. Following a targeted review by health boards of medical card lists for the over 70s, in excess of 15,100 duplicate entries and entries for deceased persons have so far been removed from those lists. My Department has now requested the chief executive officers of the health boards to arrange for an immediate full review of the entire GMS list for their functional areas, to be completed by the end of the year. They have also been requested to put in place an effective proactive management system so as to ensure that the lists are accurate in the future.During the period 1 July to 31 December 2001, a total of 68,084 additional persons aged 70 and over, including 1,446 such persons in nursing homes, had been registered as medical cardholders under the initiative. By the end of June 2002, a further 7,123 persons, including 1,024 residents of nursing homes, had been registered. In considering these figures, it is important to bear in mind that they include persons who attained the age of 70 years since 1 July 2001.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1535	The statutory background governing the entitlement of children to dental treatment under the health board dental service is section 67 of the Health Act, 1970. Under this section, the children eligible for health board dental services are pre-school and national school children in respect of defects noted at child health examinations. Child health examinations are provided by health boards to children attending a national school.There is provision under section 66(3) of the Act for a health board, at its discretion, to provide child health examinations to children attending a school that is not a national school. Such discretion may be applied once the governing body of the school so requests. The provision of dental services in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. On receipt of an application under section 66(3) of the Health Act, 1970, the chief executive officer may discharge the statutory provisions of section 66(3).
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1536	As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment in this case is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. Therefore, the regional chief execu tive of the authority has been requested to investigate the case and reply to the Deputy directly.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.

I have been informed by the NCRI that it currently does not have sufficient information to analyse cancer rates in small-local areas as would be required in order to present results on cancer rates in the lower harbour area of Cork and to compare these rates to the national average. At present, case addresses in the registry's database are coded to county level only. However, the NCRI is currently in the process of geocoding addresses in their database to district electoral division (DED) level, which will allow for analysis by local area. The NCRI expects to present results on cancer rates at local level in the coming year.As asthma is not a notifiable disease, there are no precise statistics available on the number of people with the condition in Ireland. Information regarding the number of asthma sufferers in the Cork region is not routinely collected by my Department.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1545	The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 30 April 2002. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.The main points of the survey are:(1) There were 2,280 extra nurses employed in the Health Service in the year ending 30 April 2002.(2) 1,722 nurses were recruited abroad in the year ending 30 April 2002.(3) In addition, 384 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses.(4) Health boards have increased their nurse staffing by 1,408 in the year, voluntary hospitals have recruited 664 additional nurses and the learning disability sector has boosted its staffing by 208 in the year.While all sectors reported recruitment was well ahead of resignations and retirements, employers reported that 1,047 vacancies existed at 30 April 2002. These circumstances arise where the volume of additional nursing posts being created outstrips capacity to recruit. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,200 full-time nurses to the service to compensate for shortages while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1548	BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age.BreastCheck, as with many other sectors of the health services, has found it difficult in the past to recruit specialised radiographers. This shortage of staff has meant that the programme had been unable to screen women as quickly as anticipated. BreastCheck recognised this difficulty some time ago and took a number of initiatives to address this shortage, including running both national and international recruitment campaigns.This has resulted in the recruitment of additional radiographers and BreastCheck currently has a full complement of radiographers, numbering 18 in total. BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002. To the end of August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74 per cent.No information is compiled for the national annual health service census on vacancy levels. There has, however, been an increase of 48, 6.3% in wholetime equivalent, WTE, terms in the number of radiographers employed in the public health service in the period 2000-01.As far as the number of graduates in radiography is concerned, in 2002, it is expected that a total of 22 radiographers will graduate from the two training schools at UCD, diagnostic and TCD, therapeutic – 15 are expected to graduate from UCD and seven from TCD. UCD has increased its number of training places by five in the 2002-03 academic year, from 20 to 25. It is intended to increase this number to 40 students in the 2003-04 academic year. TCD agreed to increase its intake from ten to 25 students with effect from the 2001-2002 academic year.The Deputy may wish to note that the ERHA is currently co-ordinating a concerted recruitment campaign for scarce health and social care professionals including radiographers on behalf of all the health boards.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1549	The Deputy will be aware that I announced a €40.63 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period 2000-2001. The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including: recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants and consultant anaesthetists; contracting of places in private nursing homes for patients who had completed the acute phase of treatment; provision of medical appliances and aids for older persons.My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and by the health boards that, to date, an additional 17 accident and emergency consultants and 14 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed under this initiative.Funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed, but who require additional care in an alternative setting. Additional funding was also provided as part of the investment package for the provision of a range of supports, including walking aids, wheelchairs and special beds.The Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for you – outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced, on 16 January, a €65 million investment package for the commissioning of 709 beds in acute hospitals. My Department has been advised by the ERHA and the health boards, that 217 of these beds have been commissioned to date and that the balance will be introduced on a phased basis over the coming months.

The unit commenced operation on 2 January 2002. Since the unit commenced operating it has dealt with in the region of 40,000 vetting and data protection requests. It has also reduced the length of time taken to process vetting requests for Irish workers to within a period of three weeks.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are now in discussions seeking ways of extending the service in the child care area to cover, for example, community workers, part-time employees, etc. My Department has been informed of these discussions and will be kept up to date on developments. It is hoped to achieve some early progress in the matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1558	As the Deputy may be aware, the amendments to the Registration of Births Act, 1996, which were set out in Part 6 of the Schedule to the Social Welfare Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2002, made provision that a surname of a child could be changed on the re-registration of his-her birth  to a surname jointly agreed by the parents, which could include, the mother's surname, the father's surname or a combination of the parents' surnames as entered in the register. Where there is no joint agreement by the parents in relation to the surname to be assigned to the child, the birth may be re-registered to include the father's details in the register of births. However in such instances, the surname of the child will remain as originally registered. The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, include provisions for the addition of a forename after the registration of a birth and for the correction of errors in forenames. However it is not clear that these provisions would be applicable in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.

Fees are based on estimated costs of search, retrieval and record copying and the rates are prescribed by regulation. Current rates for staff time are set out in Statutory Instrument 139 of 1998 and for copies of records in SI 522 of 1998. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of effort involved and the Act specifies circumstances where discretion is required. For example, where the records contain personal information relating to the requester, the ability of the person to pay copying charges is to be taken into account. The Act specifies that where the cost of collection would exceed the value of a fee, the fee is to be waived.Decisions under the Act are notified in writing but public bodies are recommended to contact requesters to clarify requests or discuss with them difficulties arising in the processing of them. In particular where a deposit of fees is required, the Act requires the public body to assist the requester in modifying the request so as to reduce or eliminate fees.

Comments were sought from the public on a wide range of possible measures concerning the safety of children travelling on school buses. The responses are being analysed with a view to drawing up a comprehensive set of proposals for my consideration. Among the options possible is the introduction of a standard livery for school buses, which would include the use of flashing lights to control the flow of traffic around the vehicle while the children are embarking upon or disembarking from it.

In formulating the NDP roads programme, due consideration was given to policy issues such as regional and industrial development, sustainable transport, as well as the NRA's national road needs study which was published in 1998. The programme aims to remove bottlenecks, reduce traffic congestion and decrease journey times which will improve air quality and reduce road vehicle emissions.The NDP provides for the upgrading of five main inter-urban routes in their entirety to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard, Dublin to Border, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. This reflects the importance which the Government attaches to the transportation function served by these routes in the national context and the contribution they can make to greater accessibility, thereby assisting regional development.

This position was confirmed in a further High Court judgment given in March 2001 following an action instigated by taxi interests which, among other things, sought a direction from the court in relation to compensation for losing market value.The Government has recognised, however, that some difficulties might be caused by the new taxi regime for some existing taxi licence holders and it would be appropriate to acknowledge the efforts that have been made to address those difficulties.In the first instance, arrangements were made for the introduction of a scheme of refunds by certain local authorities in relation to taxi licence fees charged at above the default level fixed in 1995. The Government also appointed a panel of three independent persons to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000. The panel was also asked to include in its report an estimate of the numbers of individual licence holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by Government.Individual holders of a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence at 21 November 2000 who considered that they had suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation made submissions to the panel and more than 2,000 were received.I have recently received a copy of the panel's report and will give it careful consideration, following which I will submit it to Government.

Ireland has participated extensively in the preliminary work leading up to the adoption of the convention and protocol and continues to contribute in the work required to finalise the arrangements for the operation of the registry.A key element of the convention and protocol is the establishment of an international registry of the various financial interests that are covered by the convention. An entry in the registry will, inter alia, determine the priority of financial interests associated with a particular aircraft.Ireland has a long history of involvement in international civil aviation, initially due to its location on the western edge of Europe. In recent times Ireland has been successful in attracting a number of aircraft maintenance facilities and a significant number of aircraft leasing companies to base their activities in this country. In this context Ireland has made no secret of its interest in having the international registry located here to further enhance our reputation in the aviation sector.It is intended that the location for the international registry will be determined through a competition to be run under the auspices of the Preparatory Commission for the International Registry, PCIR. The PCIR was established to fulfil the role of the supervisory authority on an interim basis prior to the coming into force of the convention and protocol. This is to enable the registry to begin operations as soon as possible.Following a decision by the PCIR in Montreal in May 2002 the competition will be open to private sector firms as well as to member countries of ICAO. No date has been set for the commencement of the competition as ICAO is waiting on the donation of sufficient funds to finance the running of the competition and especially the professional and impartial evaluation of the bids. Ireland has already contributed to this fund.

Existing regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.The Minister for the Environment and Local Government previously held responsibility in this area and following representations from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access, a review of the regulations was undertaken last year by his Department in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin City Council.An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. Having regard to these circumstances and having considered the various views expressed on this issue, it was decided at the time of completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions.

The primary purpose of the study is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. Thus the review will examine the long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The review will embrace both rail freight and rail passenger services. The study is due to be completed by end-2002 and the recommendations arising from it will then be put to Government.As part of the study my Department carried out a major public consultation exercise which resulted in the receipt of some 140 written submissions with regard to rail issues in Ireland, including re-opening of disused rail lines. These were the subject of further debate at workshops held in Limerick, Dublin and Sligo.I understand that one of the submissions received relates to a proposal for a western rail corridor which would include the Limerick-Athenry-Claremorris railway line. These and all the other rail proposals received are being considered by the consultants and the results of their examination will be dealt with in their final report. The question of funding for new rail lines by the Exchequer, EU or from other sources will be considered in the light of the consultants' recommendations.I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that it has taken no decision to downgrade or close the Ballina to Manulla line or any other railway line. Iarnród Éireann has not submitted any plans to me to re-open disused rail lines.

However, it can only carry out a formal investigation into a railway accident if directed to do so by the Minister.Section 7 of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871, provides that I may direct an inquiry into the cause of certain specified types of railway accidents. Section 7 also provides that I may, by order, direct a more formal investigation to be undertaken into any such accidents. No formal investigations have been undertaken over the past five years.However, in February 2002 my predecessor directed a railway inspecting officer to carry out an inquiry into the cause of the railway accident on 16 February 2001 at Kiltoom level crossing, County Roscommon. This direction replaced, on legal advice, an earlier direction dated 20 February 2001.

Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, empowers prescribed road authorities to give directions to any person carrying our road works, other than emergency works. These directions may specify matters such as the times at which road works are to be carried out. Dublin City Council, for example, is making extensive use of these powers through its Directions for the Control and Management of Roadworks in Dublin City.In addition, the Communications (Regulation) Act, 2002, requires network operators to obtain the prior written consent of the road authority to carry out road works, other than emergency road works. The Act also provides for the attaching of conditions and restrictions to the consent, which could relate to times at which road works are to be carried out.The effectiveness of existing controls, particularly those provided for in the 2002 Act, will be reviewed over the coming months and the need for further statutory powers in this regard will be considered.Furthermore, a utilities and statutory bodies working group, which is chaired by the Dublin Transportation Office and is representative of the main utilities sectors, is working towards standardising the general approach to carrying out road openings through agreed codes of practice.

Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is therefore a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.Data provided by Iarnród Éireann show that over the period from 1994 to 2001, passenger numbers on intercity services have increased from 7.8 million to an estimated 11.3 million, and on suburban services from 18.8 million to an estimated 22.7 million. To address this growth in traffic, significant funding has been and continues to be made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. The ongoing delivery of new rolling stock will increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.In the meantime, the railway inspecting officers of my Department continue to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. They have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review. The chief railway inspecting officer has also raised particular aspects of crowding on rail services with Iarnród Éireann.Iarnród Éireann responded to the chief railway inspecting officer on 24 December last, advising that the recommendations made by its consultants in 2001 for alleviating crowding on services in the Dublin area are being implemented by the company.In regard to intercity mainline services, a second independent review of its crowding management strategy is being carried out by consultants for Iarnród Éireann. Pending completion of that review, crowding issues continue to be managed in a proactive manner by Iarnród Éireann. For instance, Iarnród Éireann has adopted a system of pre-booking tickets and boarding cards at bank holiday weekends and other particularly busy periods. Iarnród Éireann is considering expanding this system to all intercity services using modern ticket reservation technology.

It is not the practice on security grounds to disclose the nature of specific aviation security measures that are in place or that may be implemented in particular circumstances.In addition to Aer Rianta, there are a range of different organisations and agencies responsible for aspects of security at the State airports. The compliance by relevant agencies at the State airports with the recommended standards for aviation security is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the National Civil Aviation Security Committee which is chaired by my Department. Any lapses in or breaches of security at the airports are reported to that committee, which seeks to ensure that any such lapses are not repeated.

This compares with an estimated throughput of just more than 15 million passengers for this year. This expanded capacity will ensure that not only will adequate safety standards be maintained but also that passengers using Dublin Airport will enjoy a higher degree of comfort than heretofore.In the area of safety, Aer Rianta informs me that a sub-committee of the board of the company is specifically responsible for safety standards at each of the three State airports and the company operates to all prescribed safety standards as set out by the Irish Aviation Authority.

The company has assured me that all railway operations on its network operate to strict standards which are in place to ensure the highest level of safety for its customers and staff.The Government places the highest priority on the safety of our railways and has continued to carry forward two railway safety initiatives started by the previous Administration. These initiatives, when complete, will greatly enhance the safety of our railways and give further comfort to railway users.The first of these initiatives is the railway safety programme which was approved by the Government in March 1999. This safety investment programme involves investment of €546 million over the five years 1999 to 2003. Already this programme has seen over €400 million invested to date and has transformed many parts of the railway, replacing 246 miles of track with continuous welded rail, permanently closing or making safer 371 level crossings and renewing 228 bridges. Significant funding has also been made available for works to cuttings and embankments, fencing and improvement of safety management systems. I also intend to seek the approval of Government in the near future for the reconvening of the railway safety task force to make recommendations for a new five year railway safety investment programme to commence in 2004.The second of these initiatives is the Railway Safety Bill which was published in December 2001. This Bill, when enacted, will modernise the railway safety regulatory framework by establishing a railway safety commission to regulate and enforce railway safety and investigate railway accidents. The Bill also places duties on railway undertakings, their staff and third parties and requires railway undertakings to put in place formal safety management systems.

The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost €130 million, is a 25,000 sq. m. terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured earlier this year and Aer Rianta is evaluating tenders for the works. The company expects that the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European city of culture in 2005. I have made it clear that this project will proceed, whatever the outcome of my current examination of options for greater autonomy for Cork Airport.

The capacity of the DART system has been increased by almost 50% since 2000 as a result of the introduction of these carriages. Figures from Iarnród Éireann indicate that more than 85,000 passengers use the service on a daily basis.The CIE board has sought my approval in recent days for the commencement of work to expand the DART as follows: upgrading the electrical power supply to increase the capacity of all trains from six to eight carriages, the lengthening of all DART platforms to cater for these longer trains (all outer suburban platforms can already handle eight carriage trains), and the construction of additional stabling sidings at Fairview. Iarnród Éireann recently placed orders for an additional 16 new DART carriages and an additional 24 carriages are planned to allow for the operation of all eight carriage trains at peak hours. All these projects are timed to deliver in 2005 an enhanced capacity of up to 16,000 passengers per hour in each direction as compared with 11,800 passengers per hour today. My Department is assessing these proposals and I hope to convey a decision on the matter shortly. Iarnród Éireann has plans to open one additional station as part of the DART expansion project.

The forum is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.As part of the programme, the level of enforcement checks has been stepped up significantly. There are currently ten transport officers assigned to enforcement duties in the road haulage division of my Department. These officers are actively engaged in the enforcement of licensing rules governing road haulage operators through roadside checkpoints, visits to operator premises and the investigation of allegations of illegal haulage received through the division's complaints system. The Deputy may wish to note that a confidential free phone service has been set up by my Department to facilitate the investigation of complaints concerning illegal haulage operations. The telephone number is 1800 202 735.These enforcement measures by my Department, and those of other agencies, will significantly improve the level of compliance with licensing and other legislation governing the road haulage industry.

The uncertainty is being compounded by the scope and speed of developments of in-car technologies.My Department is urgently examining the implications of this legal advice and the possible content of primary legislation to address the use of mobile phones by drivers.

These were as follows:

These are related to works in renewing track and signalling and will be removed on completion of the works.In addition, I am advised that there are 14 other locations throughout the network where there are permanent speed restrictions of 10 mph or less because of conditions specific to those locations. These are mainly due to the design features of the original railway, such as curvature of track at Portarlington, gradients approaching Heuston and Kilkenny stations, railway running beside the public road on Wexford Quays, etc..
Question No. 1305 answered with Question No. 1246.

The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table. At present, it is anticipated that any overruns on particular programmes will be met by savings elsewhere.As the Deputy will appreciate, this Vote is being revised to reflect the changes in departmental functions following the restructuring in the Department of Transport with effect from 19 June 2002.The downward revision of the expenditure for the Aviation Appeal Panel from that indicated in the reply to the Deputy's question on 27 June 2002 reflects the adjustment of an incorrect posting of expenditure to the relevant subhead.

As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Public Enterprise Vote is in the process of being restructured. A similar parliamentary question, which was answered in March 2002, listed the consultancy work which was expected to be carried out by the Department of Public Enterprise during 2002. This list is included at the end of this reply. The changes which have taken place in respect of the transport element of the Vote are also included.The provision under the A7 consultancy subhead in the Department of Public Enterprise Estimate for 2002 is €5 million. This represents a decrease of €1.73 million over the 2001 outturn. However, it should be pointed out that consultancy requirements vary from year to year and significant consultancy and related study work also arise in relation to specific programmes and is, therefore, funded through the relevant programme subhead.No decision has yet been made to postpone or cancel consultancies in light of budgetary constraints. The situation is monitored on a monthly basis.It is not anticipated that any capital projects will be postponed as a result of constraints in the consultancy budget.The consultancy requirement for the agencies under the Department's aegis is a matter for the relevant bodies concerned.Department of Public Enterprise Energy Consultancies to be undertaken during 2002Liberalisation of the Electricity MarketTechnical Advisor to Gas Technical Standards CommitteeFollow up to North South Energy StudyDisposal of business and certain assets of INPC to ToscoExtension of the Gas Network to the North WestLiberalisation of the Gas Market

This includes information in relation to the Department of Transport but not in respect of functions transferred from the Department of Public Enterprise to other Departments in June 2002 nor does it include general staff who may have legal qualifications.In relation to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, Mr. Brendan Gogarty, a barrister, was appointed a board member on 1 April 2000 with no remuneration. A legal qualification was not a requirement for the position. The practice has been to have a representative of the legal profession on the board. Professor Denis A. Cusack, a barrister, was appointed a board member on 1 July 2002 with no remuneration. Similarly a legal qualification was not a requirement for the position. Professor Cusack is also the director of the MBRS with a salary from July 1997 to July 2002 of €355,580.71. A legal qualification was not a requirement for this position.William Prasifka was appointed Commissioner for Aviation Regulation on 27 February 2001 in accordance with section 11 of the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001. The Civil Service Commission ran the selection process for this post. Mr. Prasifka obtained his legal qualification in the United States and worked in the area of competition law both in the US and Ireland. However, a legal qualification was not a specific requirement in the competition for the post of Commissioner for Aviation Regulation. Mr. Prasifka's remuneration is in accordance with the advertised terms of the post.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1638	Iarnród Éireann has advised me that its internal inquiry is still ongoing into the collapse of beams onto the railway at Collinstown on 9 April 2002 during the construction of a new bridge. I am aware that contractors are carrying out the works for Kildare County Council as part of the Celbridge interchange project.Iarnród Éireann also advised me that the contractor for the works has issued a revised method statement for the construction of the bridge. The method statement sets out the means by which the construction can be completed in a safe manner. This is currently being assessed by Iarnród Éireann to ensure that a reoccurrence can be prevented. Iarnród Éireann has forwarded the revised method statement to the Railway Inspectorate.Pending consideration and approval by the railway inspectorate and Iarnród Éireann of the revised method statement, work on the site remains suspended.

It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa. This may be done by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department and enclosing any additional supporting documentation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1641	Aspects of the general offence of unauthorised access to computers, usually referred to as "hacking" are covered by a number of legislative provisions. Unauthorised access on its own is covered by section 5 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, which provides for imprisonment of up to three months on summary conviction or a fine of up to the euro equivalent of £500.Section 9 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, further provides that the dishonest operation of a computer within the State with the intent of personal gain, or gain or loss to another, is also an offence. The latter Act provides a penalty, following conviction on indictment, of up to 10 years imprisonment, or a fine, or both.In relation to unauthorised access to personal data, section 22 of the Data Protection Act, 1998, provides for an offence involving unauthorised access to and subsequent disclosure of such data. Fines arising from conviction on indictment can be up to the euro equivalent of £50,000.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1642	The Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, provide that where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the circumstances render such a course desirable, he may suspend a member from duty.I have no function in the matter and, in view of the circumstances of the case referred to by the Deputy, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1643	As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been given overall responsibility for the development and co-ordination of child care services over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. In this regard, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, which was established in April, 2000, has been developed with the objective of significantly increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services over the period of the NDP.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1644	I am informed there is no trace of any representations being received from the Bosnia-Kosovo Ireland Solidarity Group.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1646	I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the allocation of resources to individual areas, that the current strength of Carrig Na Bhfear Garda station is one garda. The station is open to the public on each day the garda is rostered to work an early tour. When the station is not open to the public, a public access call box (PACB) and call diversion systems are in place and linked to district headquarters at Cobh Garda station which is operational on a 24 hour basis.There are currently no plans to alter the opening hours of Carrig na Bhfear Garda station.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1647	I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the allocation of resources to individual areas, that the current personnel strength of Glanmire Garda station as at 26 September 2002, is 16 all ranks.The station is open to the public from 10a.m. to 6p.m. on Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 1p.m. on Sunday. When the station is not open, public access call box (PACB) and call diversion systems are in place and connected to the district headquarters at Cobh Garda station, which is operational on a 24 hour basis.There are currently no plans to alter the opening hours of Glanmire Garda station.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1648	I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for a vesting certificate which was lodged on 28 May 2002.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1649	The visa applications in question were approved on appeal on 16 July 2002.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1650	The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 provides for 100 individual actions to be taken across the full range of Departments and agencies involved in the delivery of drugs policy. While it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of public expenditure in the area because of this broad approach, it is estimated that the development, co-ordination and delivery of the various elements which make up the strategy programme approximated to £144 million in 2000 (source: "Building on Experience", the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, pg. 62).In addition, the local drugs task forces (LDTF) ensure a fully integrated response to drug-related problems in the worst hit areas which takes specific account of the needs of those areas. Significant resources are being invested so that action plans developed locally to tackle drug-related problems, which complement and add value to existing services, are being implemented effectively on the ground. To date, the Government has allocated more than €51 million to implement the LDTF plans. As a direct result, more than 300 drug-related projects are now up and running in LDTF areas.I illustrate this detail to underline that the Government is fully committed to providing a comprehensive response in the community to drug-related and crime problems through funding for activities which are approved by Dáil Éireann in the normal way. I acknowledge that there may be some symbolic as well as practical value in the idea that assets which are determined by law to be the proceeds of crime be committed directly, even if only in part, towards anti-drugs and other related programmes.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1651	The Deputy will be aware that the person in question is a former member of the Defence Forces. I would not be in a position as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make an adjudication of the kind referred to by the Deputy and, accordingly, I have no proposals to make a statement of the kind requested.

Arising from a review of his application for added years in 1998, no award of ad hoc years fell to be made to the person mentioned by the Deputy. A reply to this effect was sent to him by letter dated 11 September 1998.

In particular, I refer to the results of research undertaken by the department of community health and general practice, TCD, and published by my Department in 1999 and 2000 under the title "Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV in Irish Prisoners: Prevalence and Risk". In the context of these and other reports, the Prison Service has been engaged for a considerable period in a process aimed at ensuring access to appropriate health care, including drug treatment, for the considerable number of prisoners at risk due to their substance misuse. In this regard, the Prison Service has actively sought to directly  involve community health agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in these developments.In particular, there has been a considerable expansion in the availability of methadone maintenance to prisoners who have been in receipt of this treatment from community agencies at the time of committal. It would be intended to further expand the availability of appropriate services throughout the prison system as resources permit.For many years past, prisoners with a diagnosis of HIV, hepatitis, or other infectious disease have continued to receive medical treatment while in custody in line with clinical recommendations. This medical treatment is generally in line with that available in the community. It has been long-standing practice to refer prisoners suffering from infectious diseases to specialist hospital services and to act on the basis of the clinical advice received. All such treatment is provided on the basis of informed consent and prisoners are free to refuse treatment, though instances of refusal are rare.

It furthermore says that measures will be introduced to punish the presentation and making of false and exaggerated claims in personal injury cases and, as part of this, there will be a power for the courts to deduct from damages costs relating to exaggerated claims.The question of requiring claims to be supported by a sworn affidavit including whether this might be imposed by rules of court or primary legislation is under active consideration in my Department. Consideration is also being given to introducing a provision that, if any element of a claim before a court is made in bad faith, the whole claim will, subject to appropriate safeguards, fail. Such a provision would require primary legislation.

Allowing for normal remission, he will be due for release in May 2018.In accordance with the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, the person was specified by my predecessor in November, 2000, to be a qualifying prisoner for the purposes of the Good Friday Agreement. The case was subsequently referred to the Release of Prisoners Commission for its advice in accordance with the Act.The commission forwarded its recommendations on this case to my office on 31 July 2002. I am currently considering this person's case, including the commission's recommendations, and will make a decision on the matter in due course.

I am further informed that nothing arose during this  investigation or during the trial to indicate collusion had occurred.As the Deputy will be aware, subject only to the Constitution and the law, the courts are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. I have no function in relation to verdicts of the courts, nor is it open to me to intervene in or comment in any way on the conduct of court proceedings which are entirely a matter for the presiding judge. I have been informed that the defendant in this case was acquitted on all charges by the jury who returned a verdict of not guilty.The Constitution, with certain exceptions, provides for trial by jury in any trial involving criminal charges. The role of the jury is to decide on matters of fact as disclosed by the evidence presented in court and to return a verdict. Where, as in this case, the verdict is not guilty there is no avenue for further action open to the State. This is a long-standing judicial principle which is common to very many other countries with similar judicial systems to ours and any departure from it would represent an unprecedented change in public policy in this area.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that local gardaí have met the parents of the person named in the question on a number of occasions before, during and after the trial to explain the various legal procedures involved in the case and to assist them generally in any way possible to come to terms with their son's death. Officials of my Department have also met the parents to explain the legal issues involved.

Under section 2 of this Act, a person convicted of a drug trafficking offence is disqualified for life from obtaining an intoxicating liquor licence, a public dancing licence or a public music and singing licence. Such a person is also disqualified from being a shadow licence holder. A drug trafficking offence includes offences involving drug dealing. A court can also disqualify for life from holding any such licence a person who already held a licence at the time of the conviction for a drug trafficking offence. When this happens the premises cannot again have the relevant licence attached to it.

Among its terms of reference was "to analyse nomadism in modern Irish society and to explore ways whereby mutual understanding and respect can be developed between the Travelling community and the settled community. The task force delivered its final report in July 1995. The task force made proposals across a wide range of Government activity but principally related to accommodation, health, education and equality legislation. The task force proposed an integrated package; without the provision of adequate accommodation, improvements in educational and health provision would be more difficult to undertake.

It would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to compile which could not be justified.However, the total number of convictions obtained against all drivers for the offences concerned for each of the past two years are set out below.

The great-grandchildren of persons born in Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship by registering in the foreign births register provided either of their parents had at the time of their birth acquired Irish citizenship through registration in the foreign births register. There is one exception to that rule. If one parent had registered in the foreign births register prior to 31 December 1986 the person can register even if the parent had not registered at the time of that person's birth.If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they may nevertheless be entitled to Irish citizenship as a result of marriage to an Irish citizen, post-nuptial citizenship. A person is entitled to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship if he-she is married to an Irish citizen, who is Irish other than by naturalisation, post-nuptial citizenship or honorary citizenship, for at least three years. The marriage must be valid and subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of declaration. The post-nuptial process is being repealed with effect from 30 November 2002. By way of a transitional provision, persons who are married to Irish citizens before that date but fail to satisfy the three year criterion at that time can make the declaration after that date upon completion of three years of marriage. The transitional provision will cease to apply on 30 November 2005.Finally, of course, any non national, be they Argentinian or otherwise, can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 2001, and the granting of a certificate of naturalisation is at my absolute discretion. The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements, including requirements in relation to residency. However I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances – for example, where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations. Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law. It should be noted also that the statutory residency requirements for persons who are married to Irish citizens will be reduced from 30 November 2002 in view of the fact that post nuptial citizenship will no longer be available.The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which was enacted on 6 June 2001, made extensive changes to Irish citizenship law as enunciated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994, and it is not intended to revisit the issue of foreign births registration in the foreseeable future.

The Act thus provides protection for individuals seeking insurance because a company will have to justify as reasonable any different treatment and demonstrate that it is based on reasonably reliable data or other relevant factors.Under equality legislation, there are two independent bodies with statutory roles: the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The Equality Authority which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice for any person who feels that he-she has been discriminated against on grounds of age or gender or one of the other grounds in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area.A person who claims that s-he has been discriminated against may seek redress by referring the case to the Director of Equality Investigations. The director has the power under the Equal Status Act to refer the case for mediation or to investigate and decide such a case. If the director finds in favour of the complainant, she may make an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination and/or order a specific course of action to be taken.

I consider in full all recommendations put before me by the Interim Parole Board before making the final decision regarding sentence management.The Olden report was commissioned in light of a conviction of a person, already serving a life sentence for murder, for a second murder committed while on temporary release from Castlerea Prison. The terms of reference to Mr. Olden were to review and report on the management of his sentence up to that time; specifically report on the procedures followed leading to granting-revocation of periods of temporary release to this prisoner and to make any observations and recommendations considered appropriate.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1680	The Government decided in March 1993 that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government  further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. The Government decision was issued to all Departments as guidelines which were further extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature etc.Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and constantly keeps the situation under review.Substantial progress has been made since 1992 in relation to gender balance on boards. Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nominating bodies, increased from 15% in 1992 to 29% at 31 March 2002 and from 17% to 35% of ministerial nominations in the same period.One of the reasons for the imbalance between men and women on State boards is that women have not yet reached top management levels in significant numbers in many areas. Recent research on gender equality in the Civil Service demonstrates this.The NDP gender equality unit in my Department is providing funding of €54,922 for the National Women's Council of Ireland to conduct research on the representation of women in decision-making bodies in Ireland. As part of this funding, a debate on women in politics, which was attended by representatives from all political parties, was held on 8 March 2002, International Women's Day. Further outcomes of this work will include a research report, and a photographic exhibition of women in decision-making bodies.The NDP gender equality unit also promotes gender balance on monitoring committees which oversee spending under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The unit actively monitors the representation of women on these committees and has also provided guidance to monitoring committees interested in increasing their female representation.While significant progress has been made towards the target of a minimum of 40% of both men and women on State boards, I am anxious to close the remaining 5% deficit in ministerial nominations and 11% deficit in overall nominations. The Government is committed to the principle of a minimum target of 40% representation of both women and men on state boards and has declared its commitment to achieving this target in the programme for Government.

I understand that in progressing this task, the consultation team is examining proposals from disability groups as well as engaging with other relevant stakeholders.In light of the ongoing consultations it would not be helpful for me to comment on the likely content of any future Disability Bill, or to speculate on the future views of Ministers in relation to it, especially as An Agreed Programme for Government deals with the matter in quite specific terms.

The report's overall conclusion is that what is required are key institutional mechanisms-models to spearhead and ensure effective follow-through on the report's recommendations.Priority is being given to developing these mechanisms. A high level co-ordination group on prisoner reintegration has been established, and is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department. This group is comprised of senior officials from the Departments and statutory agencies which are identified in the report as having a role to play in progressing its implementation. The group will also be drawing on the expertise of the many community and voluntary groups that have experience of dealing with the issues raised by the report. The group is currently examining the areas for action highlighted in the report and will oversee the implementation of the appropriate recommendations.The elaboration of positive sentence management, as a mechanism for effective integration and co-ordination of all services and programmes designed to meet the complex and diverse needs of offenders, is a key task for the Prison Service. Important aspects of this task are the building of alliances and partnerships with the wider community and the development of a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of drug treatment, education, multidisciplinary programmes – including offender behavioural programmes – and a more widely available CONNECT project. The appointment of a director of regimes in the Prison Service has been an important step in this process and will provide an administrative driver for this task. It is intended to establish in the very near future, a working group on positive sentence management within the Prison Service comprising all the relevant agencies and bodies. This working group will be mindful of and take heed of best practice in other jurisdictions.

Applications for certificates of naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time of such applications is approximately 15 months at the present time and I anticipate that the application of the person referred to by the Deputy will be finalised in the near future. When I have reached a decision on the matter both the applicant and the Deputy will be informed of the outcome.

There are currently no plans to change the status of either Ballyfermot or Sundrive Road Garda stations.The optimum use of Garda stations in the Dublin area is being considered as part of a major review of the Garda organisation structures under the Strategic Management Initiative programme of modernisation. That review is not yet completed. On completion, the review will be submitted for consideration by Government.

This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Accordingly, the situation of Falun Gong practitioners would be taken into account by me in considering their cases as well as the merits of the case in accordance with the criteria specified in section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. Those criteria include, for example, humanitarian considerations and representations made by or on behalf of the person. To date, I am not aware of membership of Falun Gong being an issue in deportations to China as the vast majority of such cases relate to Chinese nationals who are illegal immigrants in the State rather than refused asylum seekers.

At the present time it is anticipated that both of these bodies will come within the scope of the Act from 1 November 2002. FOI has been extended to additional public bodies on a phased basis since it commenced in April 1998. The Government has decided that this process should continue so that all bodies appropriate for inclusion are covered by end-2005. I understand that consultations at official level will be initiated in the near future by the Department of Finance with a view to setting a date for inclusion under the Act of the above bodies where this is found to be appropriate.

In February 1998, the Garda districts of Nenagh and Newcastle West were selected by the Garda Commissioner as part of a pilot project to enhance the operational effectiveness of rural community policing. The aim of the project was to facilitate the public with fixed opening times for rural Garda stations.The Garda Síochána view the rural community policing initiative as being an important part in the provision of their community policing service.More generally, I might mention that community policing is being considered as part of a major ongoing review of Garda organisational structures under the Strategic Management Initiative programme of modernisation. The outcome of that review will be submitted for consideration by Government when completed.

Schedule Number 80635 refers. Land Commission Schedule applications are deemed to be registered as of the date of vesting which is prior to the date of lodgement of the documents in the Land Registry.

This recommendation was accepted by my predecessor – the response to Parliamentary Question No. 499 of 7 March 2002, is of relevance in this regard.Correspondence has since been received asking that the decision be reviewed. This correspondence has been forwarded to the advisory committee whose views in this regard are currently awaited. I will consider the matter further upon receipt of these views.The Deputy may wish to note that, subject to the availability of funds, the 17 locations set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years have already been decided upon and publicly announced.

It would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to compile such information.The number of murders for the years 1992 to 2001 – and for January to September 2002 – and the number of murders recorded each month from 1996 to September, 2002 are set out as follows.

The proposal that was made available on the Council website – ue.eu.int – in July 2002, contains a request that, in the near future, binding rules should be established on the approximation of member states' rules on the obligation of telecommunications services providers to keep information concerning telecommunications in order to ensure that such information is available when it is of significance for a criminal investigation. The proposal contains no detailed indications as to what the contents of such rules should be but emphasises that such rules must be established taking account of the requirements regarding privacy and the processing of personal data which stem from the European Convention on Human Rights of 4 November 1950, the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The proposal is currently under consideration in the relevant Council expert group and is unlikely to be ready for adoption in the near future. There are no further proposals in relation to retention of traffic data along the lines set out in the Deputy's question and I understand that the Danish Presidency is not engaged in drafting any such proposals.

Under this Act it is a criminal offence for any person to knowingly possess child pornography. The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for this offence is five years imprisonment. It is also an offence for any person to knowingly possess child pornography for the purpose of distributing, publishing, exporting, selling or showing it. Persons found guilty of this offence are liable on conviction on indictment to  up to 14 years imprisonment. The Dáil agreed to the penalty structure in the Act as recently as 1998. They are among the most severe penalties for these offences anywhere. I am satisfied that they are an adequate and appropriate deterrent for the offences concerned and I have no plans at present to review them.At present an EU framework decision on the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography is being negotiated. If the finalised document gives rise to the need for changes to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, I will seek Government approval to prepare the legislation without delay.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to change the divisional boundaries of Roscommon/Galway East. However, more generally the revision of district and divisional boundaries is being considered as part of a major ongoing review of Garda organisational structures under the Strategic Management Initiative programme of modernisation. The outcome of that review will be submitted for consideration by Government when completed.

In this light, the details requested in relation to payments by my Department to non-governmental organisations are too extensive for inclusion on the normal electronic system for replying to parliamentary questions. I have, however, made arrangements to have the information delivered to the Deputy in manuscript form on today's date. Due to the large amount of data involved in respect of childcare, prisons authority, probation and welfare service and the time scale for answering parliamentary questions the divisions will forward the information directly to the Deputy, under separate cover.

In this regard, I am also informed that the Garda Síochána special projects and the Cabra community policing forum ensures there is a uniform and holistic policing policy for the entire Cabra area. The local divisional officer is satisfied that the existing boundaries do not detract from the police service provided to the Cabra area, but will continue to monitor the situation and will consider changes if deemed necessary. In relation to the allocation of personnel to the Cabra area, the Garda authorities inform me that the Assistant Commissioner Dublin Metropolitan Region is satisfied that personnel strengths at Cabra are sufficient to cover uniform protection duty at Áras an Uachtaráin.With regard to the Deputy's query on public order vans, the Garda authorities have informed me that there are four public order vans attached to the K District comprising Blanchardstown, Finglas and Cabra stations. One van is attached to Finglas and three are attached to Blanchardstown. There are four official vehicles attached to Cabra Garda station and there are no plans to provide an additional public order van at Cabra Garda station.

The incidents which occured outside the premises were of a public order nature. Local Garda management indicate that recent complaints relate to the operation of this premises and anti-social activities. I understand that a meeting has recently taken place at Fitzgibbon Street Garda station between the local residents and local Garda management to discuss issues relating to the Temple Theatre. It was explained to residents that, in the current round of licensing renewal applications, the Gardaí would be applying to have the hours restricted to 2 a.m. and not 4 a.m., as in the application currently before the licensing court. The residents informed the Gardaí that they would prefer more stringent controls or a closure of the premises. Residents were advised to set out their objections and lodge them with the District Court clerk, which they did. The Garda assured residents that they would continue to properly police the venue and attention would be afforded by both foot and mobile patrols. I am further informed that when  this matter came before the annual licensing court, both applications were adjourned for mention to Dublin District Court on 23 October 2002 when it is expected that a date will be fixed for the hearing of the various objections. In the meantime, the existing licences remain in force and the Garda continues to deal with issues as and when they arise.

Accordingly, they may be imported into the State only under an importation licence granted by my Department and it is a long standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. There are further provisions in the law in relation to, for example, the throwing, casting or firing of fireworks in or onto any street or other public place which is an offence under section 80 of the Explosives Act, 1875. Explosives legislation is under review in my Department, but further criminalisation gives rise to complex issues.

Examples of such provisions, of which there are many, are section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, section 29 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and section 48 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001. Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, contains a general search warrant provision in relation to serious offences, that is, indictable offences involving the death of or serious bodily injury to a person, false imprisonment, rape and certain other sexual offences. It provides, on the hearing of evidence on oath given by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector, for the issuing by a judge of the District Court of a warrant authorising a named member, accompanied by any other member, of an Garda Síochána to search a place and any persons found at that place, if the judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting evidence of or relating to the commission of such an offence is to be found in such place.

This legislation contains detailed provisions concerning the exercise of the powers allocated to the board and, in particular, section 4 of the 1986 Act enables the board to receive complaints from the public in respect of allegations of misconduct on the part of members of the Garda Síochána, provided certain conditions are met. The relevant conditions are effectively set out in section 4(3) of the Act and they include a requirement that the complainant  must have been directly affected by or have witnessed the conduct alleged in the complaint and that the conduct complained of occurred within six months of the making of the complaint.The Act enables the board to deal with a complaint where the alleged misconduct involved would constitute a criminal offence or be conduct specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Act. In that context, the main areas of conduct covered by the Fourth Schedule are discourtesy, neglect of duty, falsehood or prevarication, abuse of authority, corrupt or improper conduct, misuse of money or property in the custody of the Garda Síochána belonging to a member of the public, intoxication, discreditable conduct and being an accessory to conduct specified in the schedule.

The Government recently approved a review from the Garda SMI Steering Group on Performance and Accountability and decided that legislation should be introduced to give effect to the proposals in that report. That legislation will enable a transfer to the Garda Commissioner of the role of Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote. However, this transfer will take effect only when the Government is satisfied that the performance and accountability framework and the necessary supporting financial framework is in place.As regards plans to increase the strength of the force, An Agreed Programme for Government provides for an increase of 2,000 members over the lifetime of that programme.

He is currently serving this sentence in the open centre at Loughan House, County Cavan, and allowing for normal remission is due for release on 10 September 2003.As the Deputy is aware, it is long standing policy not to comment in detail on the sentence management of any individual prisoner. However, my attention has been drawn to a recent newspaper article which alleges that this person received favourable treatment during an escort to facilitate a court appearance and I am prepared to comment on the claims made therein.The facts of this case are that Sligo Circuit Court issued a witness summons ordering this person to appear in that Court on 1 September 2002. The prisoner made an application for temporary release to attend this hearing and this application was refused. However, he was escorted to the court by two prison officers from Loughan House. It is standard practice that persons serving sentences in open centres are not handcuffed during such escorts. This reflects their low security status.I would also like to confirm that the Director General of the Prison Service has assured me that this person was accompanied by prison staff at all times while outside the confines of Loughan House on this escort. Indeed it is the case that this escort was conducted in line with standard operational procedures and the prisoner was accompanied at all times by prison staff and was not, in fact, afforded any preferential treatment.

The balance is mainly made up by new investment by the private sector and repair, maintenance and improvement work.The combined effect of public and private investment put a strain on the capacity of the domestic construction industry, during the initial phase of implementation of the NDP. However, the capacity constraint has now been considerably eased for two principal reasons.First, the Action Plan to Expand the Capacity of the Construction Industry published by my Department in June 2001 launched a package of more than 50 measures to expand construction industry capacity. The Forum for the Construction Industry published a review-progress report on the action plan in July 2002, which concluded that an excellent start has been made in implementing the action plan; construction supply is more in balance with demand; and the momentum for further construction capacity increases should be maintained, so that future demands can be met. Copies of both documents are available in the Library.Second, the demands on construction capacity have eased due primarily to the cooling of the level of new construction investment by the private sector. The net result has been the substantial reduction in construction price inflation – from a peak of 12% per annum over the period 1998 to 2000, to 9% in 2001 and a projected 5% in 2002. This inflation is expected to reduce further in 2003 and to allow the continued roll out of the NDP under conditions which will deliver greater value for money.

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004, published in April 2002. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.

Where a member or successor members of the tenant's family succeed to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession as a tenant under the 1982 Act continues to 25 July 2002, or until the tenancy has lasted a minimum of five years.Once protection for successor tenants ceases under the 1982 Act, I am advised that they may be entitled to claim a long equity lease of up to 35 years under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. If the landlord is unwilling to grant such a lease, the tenant may apply to the Circuit Court to determine a tenant's entitlement and also to set the rent and other tenancy terms in the absence of agreement between the parties.

Eligible works may include the drilling or sinking of a well. It is a condition of eligibility for grant purposes that the house has not been constructed within the previous seven years or that a grant for the provision of the house, or for the provision or improvement of a water supply to the house, has not been paid within the previous seven years. I have no proposals to modify these qualifying conditions.

My Department is not in a position to make a direct financial contribution to the association. However, where a local authority considers it appropriate it may assist a body which is endeavouring to reduce, in a humane manner, the problems caused by feral cats. A number of local authorities in the Dublin area have provided assistance to the Cats Protection Association in recent years.My Department will soon write to local authorities suggesting that where the local authority calls on the services of animal welfare bodies to deal with feral cat problems the local authority should consider making a financial contribution towards the costs of providing such services.

Some €1.1 billion capital funding is being provided by my Department to local authorities and voluntary bodies in the current year for these programmes.I expect that output from all the social housing measures, along with vacancies occurring in the existing rented housing stock, will enable the housing needs of approximately 13,000 households, including homeless persons, to be met this year.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1756	The 1996 Greater Dublin Water Supply Strategic Study estimated that 44% of drinking water produced in the greater Dublin region was lost through leakage, principally in the distribution network. The Dublin Regional Water Conservation Project is addressing this issue and a review of unaccounted for water, UFW, in the region in 2000 estimated that losses from the water distribution system had been reduced to 32% of production. The latest estimate further reduces that figure to 27.5%.Following the Dublin study, a programme of water conservation measures was introduced in a number of major cities and towns around the country. The objective of programme is to reduce UFW levels in distribution networks to improve supply to consumers, lower operating costs and maximise the value of investment in capital water supply works. Water conservation projects with an estimated cost of €129 million are currently under way in fifteen locations, including Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel. Significant reductions in UFW levels are being achieved.

The magpie, pica pica, is widely distributed around Ireland and a 1988-91 survey of the species indicated that there are an estimated 320,000 breeding pairs in the country. There is no subsequent comprehensive data available to show whether there has been an increase in magpie numbers since then, although the bird has been successful in adapting to urban life.While there is a widely held perception that the magpie is a danger to other bird species, in particular songbirds, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The position is that the magpie is a predator like a number of bird species, for example, the sparrowhawk, and will eat the eggs and the young of other birds. However, scientific advice indicates that this presents no significant threat to the conservation status of other bird species. There are no estimates available for the impact, if any, of magpie predation on other birds. However, a study in England concluded that an analysis of the trends in magpie numbers and in the numbers and breeding success for eleven species of songbird provided no evidence that magpies had any effect on songbirds.

The Act also provides  in section 10 and the First Schedule that a planning authority may include objectives in its development plan regulating, restricting or controlling development on the foreshore.

Authorities were asked to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix waste of waste treatment facilities which, at a regional level, would maximise recovery of materials or energy and minimise environmental emissions, at reasonable cost. Against this background, regional waste management plans subsequently adopted by 29 local authorities provide, inter alia, for six thermal treatment facilities to recover energy from waste that cannot otherwise be re-used or recycled. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency's national hazardous waste management plan identifies a need for a thermal treatment facility for hazardous waste.

Consequently, any person who participated in the decision making process by the planning authority must be notified of the fact that an appeal has been made, and will be able, if they so wish, to make another submission or observation to the board in respect of the appeal. It is a matter for each planning authority to put arrangements in place to ensure that these obligations are complied with.

As regards major relevant projects being assisted by my Department, the Dublin region wastewater treatment scheme, currently nearing completion, will significantly improve water quality throughout Dublin Bay. This €328m project will transport waste water from Dublin city and surrounds to a new treatment works in Ringsend due for completion later this year. Treatment will incorporate preliminary, secondary and tertiary processes, with nitrogen removal, and ultraviolet disinfection.The benefits will include – improved water quality in Dublin Bay, allowing it to comply with the Dublin Bay water quality management plan, cessation of discharges of untreated sewage from the Nose of Howth and improvement of bathing water quality at Dollymount Strand which will facilitate its qualification for blue flag status.

Where local authorities require such reports it is generally to ensure that the most appropriate works are carried out to meet the needs of the applicant and that the potential long-term needs of the applicant are addressed having regard to their disability. It is also a matter for the local authority to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants and in this regard it is open to a local authority to engage an occupational therapist where this would be warranted.I continue to urge local authorities to operate the scheme in a flexible and responsive manner having regard to the needs of applicants. Local authorities should have regard to the availability of occupational therapists and any likely delay when determining whether an occupational therapist's report should be sought in any case. My Department has also raised with the Department of Health and Children the need for appropriate procedures to ensure that any necessary reports of occupational therapists can be supplied speedily.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1774	Successive Irish Governments have been firmly opposed to nuclear energy because of the safety and environmental risks which it poses. This Government's nuclear policy places a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection. While recognising that certain European countries, including Britain, have retained nuclear energy as an option for power generation, and while one of the tasks of Euratom is to promote the establishment and growth of nuclear industries in the Union, Ireland has remained strongly opposed to nuclear energy.I do not accept that Ireland's membership of EURATOM is contrary to the Government's position regarding Sellafield. The Government's concerns about Sellafield have informed Ireland's priorities within EURATOM. Working within the EURATOM structures, Ireland's primary emphasis has always been to steer the EURATOM programme of activities towards nuclear safety and radiological protection rather than the expansion of the nuclear energy sector. Ireland is concerned to ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety are in place in the EU now and as enlarged.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1775	I am aware of the incident referred to, which occurred in May 2002. I understand from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), which was informed at the time by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), that the incident involved mechanical vibration of a gas circulator that circulates the reactor coolant. This resulted in major damage to the circulator and in one reactor being shut down. The other reactor was also shut down before any major damage occurred.According to the RPII, the NII is satisfied that there are adequate back-up systems to ensure reactor cooling. The RPII has also advised me that, with regard to this type of reactor, which is of the advanced gas cooled variety, even if a loss of cooling were to occur, there would be more time available to restore cooling before reactor core overheating started, than in the case of a water cooled reactor. The RPII understanding from the NII is that at no time did the incident compromise safety. I understand from the RPII that the reactors at the facility in question remain shut down and will not be allowed to reopen until the NII is satisfied that it is safe to do so. The RPII will be maintaining close contact with the NII in this matter.Incidents such as that at Torness underline the risks and dangers associated with nuclear energy. The UK Government is fully aware of the concerns of the Irish Government about the UK nuclear energy industry, including the operations at Sellafield. We have pointed out regularly that the risks and unresolved problems associated with the nuclear energy industry, when added to the high research and capital costs, including decommissioning costs, as well as continued additional safety and security costs, mean that nuclear energy is not sustainable. The significant recorded losses of British Nuclear Fuels and the financial situation at British Energy underscore the Irish Government's position in this regard.

My Department does not have information regarding the percentage of newspapers utilising recycled paper. However, it has been estimated that around 150,000 tonnes of newsprint are generated annually in Ireland. Following dialogue with representatives of the print media industry, my Department expects proposals for a producer responsibility initiative (PRI) to recycle newsprint to be submitted in the near future.A proposal for a PRI for waste tyres has been submitted for endorsement to my Department by the Irish Tyre Industry Association. This proposal is under consideration at present and I will respond to it shortly. A number of collection systems are in place to recover car and other batteries. The policy statement recognises a need for more systematic arrangements for this waste stream, and my Department is initiating dialogue with the relevant sectors to devise and agree a suitable PRI scheme.

Under section 205 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, it is an offence to cut down, lop, fell or destroy a tree covered by a TPO without the consent of the planning authority. The law on TPOs was substantially revised and strengthened in the 2000 Act and the penalties increased. Fines of up to €1905 or a term of imprisonment of up to six months, may be imposed for such an offence on conviction in the District Court. On conviction in the higher courts, the maximum fine is €12,700,000, or up to two years imprisonment, or both. These new, simplified and strengthened provisions relating to protected trees have been recently erected to pro vide a stronger deterrent against illegal behaviour. I have no plans to further modify the legislation at present.

The Agreed Programme for Government has stated clearly that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland; that it should be closed; and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat. Ireland shares many concerns with non-governmental organisations in relation to nuclear safety, and respects the right of peaceful protest by such organisations. However, our approach within the framework of, Government-to-Government relationships, has been to take appropriate diplomatic and legal routes to address our objectives. We have taken legal action against the UK in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant under the OSPAR Convention and also under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We have reserved the right to bring a case under EU law also and will rely on legal advice as we actively pursue our con cerns in relation to nuclear safety on all appropriate fronts.In relation to the specific transports of MOX fuel returned from Japan recently, the Irish Government has made clear its concerns regarding these issues on the basis of the risk of an accident or incident with associated detrimental impacts on the Irish people, the environment and the economy as a whole.The shipment did not enter or travel in Irish waters. Nevertheless, in the interest of maintaining full preparedness in the event of any accident or incident to the ships, the Government decided that the monitoring and observation services available to the country would be used during the period when the vessels entered the Irish Sea until docking in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

These sites are protected under the provisions of the European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations, 1997, rather than under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.The provisions of the latter Act relating to natural heritage areas have so far been applied to the designation of some seven sites of importance for birds.

These measures include the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme which enables local authorities to improve or extend privately owned houses occu pied by an approved applicant for housing as an alternative to the provision of local authority housing. In addition, the scheme of extensions to local authority houses enables local authorities to extend a local authority house to meet the accommodation needs of a household assessed and accepted as in need of re-housing, particularly on the grounds of overcrowding.Information in relation to activity under the improvement works and extensions schemes for each local authority is published in my Department's quarterly and annual bulletins of housing statistics, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.

The terms of the cover under the mortgage protection plan was negotiated by a sub-committee of the County and City Managers Association, the Housing Finance Agency and a representative of my Department. These terms are renegotiated periodically by the committee. The cost of the mortgage protection plan is met by way of an additional charge, currently 0.67%, to the rate of interest charged on individual loans. One of the conditions of the plan, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.

Membership of regional assemblies comprises county and city councillors, who are also members of their constituent regional authorities, thus providing linkages between the different levels of local government.

Under the shared ownership scheme, a rental subsidy is payable to lower income applicants which substantially reduces the amount of rent to be paid. The mortgage allowance scheme is available to local authority tenants, tenant purchasers and tenants of a house provided by a voluntary body under the rental subsidy scheme who are leaving their existing accommodation and acquiring a private house with a mortgage loan other than under the shared ownership scheme. Payment of mortgage allowance to shared ownership applicants could involve a significant double subsidy and, accordingly, I have no plans to amend the terms of the scheme on the lines suggested.

Proposals for waste infrastructure by a local authority, or by private interests in partnerships with a local authority, and which require EIA, already go directly for discussion to An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development Act, 2000.My Department is currently considering the need for further streamlining in the interests of ensuring that planning decisions on important waste infrastructure proposals are taken in a timely manner consistent with full consideration of all relevant issues.

With assistance from EU Structural Funds, under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-1999, the re-roofing of Doneraile Court was completed during 2001 at a cost of some €888,000.I am aware and am concerned, however, that some seepage of water arising from these recent works has adversely affected the fabric of the house. Arising from this development, the Office of Public Works, as project managers of the contract in question, have withheld some moneys until these defects have been satisfactorily attended by the contractor.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 a further sum of €2.5 million has been allocated for the carrying out of works to enable Doneraile Court to be opened to the public. This project is still at planning stage.In relation to staffing levels in Doneraile Park, I am satisfied that the existing staff of four full-time persons, including a herdsman, reporting to the Dúchas deputy regional manager is adequate to properly manage the site.

Under this formula, Galway County Council could select a maximum of five towns for which plans could be submitted: Ballinasloe was not one of the towns selected by Galway County Council and consequently could not be considered for designation under the scheme.There are no proposals to make further designations under the town renewal scheme, which runs until 31 December 2003.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1844	I recently met representatives of Threshold to discuss their strategic plan and other policy issues of concern to them. As is acknowledged by Threshold, much has been done over the past five years to address housing needs.The Government's efforts in support of housing have delivered record levels of overall housing output in successive years, enabling us to meet demand and improve affordability. The effects of this increased output can be seen in moderating house price trends. Average year on year house price data indicates that house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to around 5-7% per annum in June last. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market with first time buyer grant applications increasing by nearly 15% in the first seven months of 2002 compared with the same period in 2001.Under the NDP, social housing provision has also been significantly expanded. I anticipate that output from the local authority housing programme, together with output from the complementary social housing programmes of voluntary, affordable and shared ownership housing will meet the needs of some 13,000 households this year.Moreover, we remain committed to the implementation of major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommendations of the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector. The drafting of the legislation required to set up the board on a statutory basis and implement other commission recommendations, such as improving security of tenure for tenants, is progressing. These reforms should facilitate the development of a better managed and more professional private rented sector.Finally, as required under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities have prepared housing strategies which identify the overall need for housing within the area covered by the strategy, including the need for social and affordable housing.We will continue to progress these measures and monitor housing developments while reviewing policies as necessary to ensure that we meet demand going forward.

Under Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, quarries over five years old, whether subject to planning permission or otherwise, are required to be registered with the planning authority. Planning authorities will then be entitled to impose conditions on the operation of registered quarries.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1852	The 2002 spend in respect of my Department as it is now constituted is broadly consistent with the relevant profiles of expenditure which were drawn up in accordance with the provisions set out in the 2002 Revised Estimates for Public Services. An excess of some €50 million for recoupment to local authorities in respect of accommodation for homeless persons, including asylum seekers, will be offset by savings in a range of other programmes. These programmes are likely to include regeneration of local authority housing areas, non-national roads, waste management and urban renewal grants where, for various reasons, it would not be possible or prudent to expend the relevant estimates provision in full.

Under this scheme, relevant capital expenditure  incurred since the beginning of the year is eligible for support. More than 260 grant applications were received in my Department by 31 May, the deadline for applications, and a first round of grant allocations will be announced shortly. Funding will be available to meet anticipated demand arising in respect of 2002.My Department does not incur current expenditure in respect of recycling activities. Repak Limited subsidises operational costs involved in the recovery of packaging waste. I understand that Repak incurred expenditure of about €9 million in 2001 on direct recycling supports, and that this level of expenditure is likely to increase during 2002. This is in addition to substantial ongoing support by local authorities for recycling activities generally.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1858	An Agreed Programme for Government states that the national recycling effort will be assisted by the banning of certain types of waste from landfill.The Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations, 2002, which I made in July, prohibit the landfilling of liquid waste and certain hazardous and infectious wastes in new landfills from July 2001, in hazardous landfills from July 2002 and in all landfills from July 2009.The regulations also prohibit the landfilling of whole tyres in new, or hazardous, landfill facilities from July 2003, and of shredded tyres from July 2006. These dates are extended to July 2009 in the case of existing landfill facilities. I have received proposals from Irish Tyre Industry Association for a producer responsibility initiative for the collection and treatment of used tyres, and will keep the prohibition dates under review in the context of the implementation of producer responsibility in the sector.In addition, I am finalising new waste management packaging regulations which will prohibit the landfilling of recyclable packaging waste.When addressing the inaugural meeting of the National Construction and Demolition Waste Council in June, I indicated that the widespread disposal to landfill of unsegregated construction and demolition waste must cease. I will give consideration to this issue over the coming months in parallel with the work of the council.

In determining priority as between grant applicants, local authorities would have regard to relative means and needs and generally restrict payment of essential repairs grants to elderly persons.The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by health boards, provides grants to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. Typically, aid is available for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1864	To enable An Bord Pleanála to deal with appeals, including cases involving a sizeable number of jobs, significant extra staffing and financial resources have been made available to the board in recent years. Board membership has doubled from six in 1998 to the current membership of 12; the authorised staffing complement increased by 29 in 2000 and by a further four in 2001 to a current level of 138; 79 planners have been engaged on a fee-per-case basis to provide reports on the smaller types of appeals; seven consultancy firms have been engaged to provide reports on larger cases; and a panel of consultants has been set up to hold hearings in relation to motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and other procedures devolved  to the board under the Planning and Development Act, 2000.The board accords priority to cases involving development with significant employment generating potential, large scale residential developments – 30 units or more – and cases involving significant infrastructural development. It has a special project team to deal with large scale residential developments and considerable progress has been made in reducing the backlog of such cases.With regard to the general workload of the board, the backlog of cases has been substantially reduced this year, from 2,700 at the end of 2000 to less than 1,600 cases at the end of September 2002. The board has stated its confidence that the entire backlog will have been cleared by end November 2002 to a sustainable ongoing level of 1,500 cases on hand. It is anticipated that once the backlog has cleared there will be a marked improvement in the percentage of cases determined within the statutory objective period.I am also advised by the board, now that the backlog has been virtually eliminated, that it is considering further measures for the future to ensure that its priority system is made as effective as possible so as to ensure that decisions are made in a timely manner and consistent with a full examination of all relevant planning issues.Planning appeals necessarily take some time to process because the principles of natural justice and statutory provisions require the board to give each party an opportunity to comment on the views of the other parties in the appeal and to give full consideration to all such views and to the report and recommendation of its inspector. The Planning Act, 2000, sets an objective of appeals being determined within 18 weeks of receipt. I shall continue to monitor the performance of the board so that it meets or exceeds this objective in the vast majority of cases as soon as possible.To ensure that the board is organised to discharge its responsibilities efficiently, a full independent review of the board's organisation and staffing has been carried out. The draft report on the review was submitted to the board in July 2002. The review examined the board's management structures and practices to ensure that they are appropriate to the functions and volume of work facing the board. Following consultation with staff interests, I expect that the review will be submitted to me by the board in the near future. I will consider carefully the board's proposals for the future organisation, staffing and resourcing of the board with a view to ensuring that optimum performance is achieved.

No formal plans in this regard have however been submitted to my Department.

This report was passed to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, DCAL, in the North who co-sponsor the body.In March 2002 DCAL requested that the consultants be asked to clarify a number of aspects of the report, mainly in relation to economic assumptions and social needs. This was received in June 2002.It is clear from the report that the project would not be justifiable on economic grounds. Therefore, any consideration would have to be on the basis of the social and general cross-Border social benefits to the areas through which the canal passes. Recently it was decided to commission a further report, at modest cost, into the various funding options which might be available.No decision has been made as to whether to proceed with the restoration of the Ulster Canal.

Some €4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and-or installation of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the "pendant" alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, this Department has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees. Unfortunately, funding is not available under the scheme for repairs, replacements or upgrading of this equipment.A review of the scheme was conducted in 1999 and there are no plans to amend the terms of the scheme.

The purpose of these is to ensure a sufficient depth of water to allow for navigation in times of low water flows. The level of water on this stretch of river is controlled by these weir boards in conjunction with 18 sluices at Marlborough, near Meelick, and 12 sluices at Meelick.On 10 May 2002 all weir boards were put in place due to dropping water levels. On 18 May, due to rising water levels, all sluices at Meelick were opened. On 19 May, due to continuing rising water levels, all remaining sluices at Marlborough were opened and on 20 May 2002, as the water levels continued to rise, all 115 weir boards in the weir at Meelick were removed. Due to continued heavy rainfall, the water levels continued to rise thereafter. When all sluices are opened and all weir boards have been removed Waterways Ireland has no further control on water levels. The weir boards were not re-installed until 2 August 2002.Water levels on the Shannon are controlled by a series of weirs with sluices; the levels in the channels are controlled by Waterways Ireland and in the lakes by the ESB. In 2000 Waterways Ireland and the ESB jointly commissioned consulting engineers, Kirk McClure Morton, to carry out a study of the current management of the water levels of the River Shannon. Having assessed a range of alternative management options, they concluded that none of these would result in a significant impact on water levels, over those operated by the ESB and Waterways Ireland.

All the issues which it raised can be looked at in the context of the strategy.I am informed by the Department of Health and Children that health boards have received significant additional funding for drug treatment and rehabilitation services in recent years. In 2002 the Eastern Regional Health Authority received an additional €5.378 million to assist the implementation of actions contained in the strategy.In 2003, as with other years, all Departments will seek the resources necessary to implement the relevant actions in the strategy through the annual Estimates process.In regard to Dublin City Wide's queries about treatment services for cocaine, the ERHA has reported that its services are beginning to notice an increase in those presenting with problems related to cocaine use. Services for cocaine users primarily involve counselling. Additional counsellors and outreach workers have been recruited by the three area health boards of the ERHA in the past number of years.In addition, a pilot programme in relation to cocaine use is due to commence in the city clinic located in the Northern Area Health Board region later this month. It will address all issues pertaining to cocaine use and will be led by a counselling team with participation of all disciplines including a doctor, nurse, psychiatrist and outreach worker.The course will run for eight weeks and will then be reviewed. It is envisaged that if the review is successful the course will run at regular intervals throughout the NAHB area.In relation to the regional drugs task forces, nominations are currently being sought from the various sectors. The national drugs strategy team has also prepared guidelines which have been disseminated to the various sectors and agencies for observations and agreement. Decisions on budgets will be taken once the task forces are formally established.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already dealt with the general issue raised in redirecting value of assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau back directly into the community in his written answer to another question tabled by the Deputy for today, Parliamentary Question No. 1331, reference No. 15483/02.

I am pleased that the report acknowledges the role that the White Paper on Rural Development and, of course, the CLÁR programme which I launched last year, play in rural policy initiatives. The principal criterion in selecting the CLÁR areas was population decline.My appointment, with a wide-ranging brief for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs, is tangible evidence of the Government's commitment not only to rural areas but to communities in general, especially those who are disadvantaged.The way forward set out in the report deserves careful consideration. I am examining the proposals in relation to my areas of responsibility as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I intend to consult other Ministers as appropriate.An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme, ensuring annual funding, and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. I have recently initiated that review.In the meantime, the current CLÁR programme continues to operate successfully supported by the €25 million provided for the 2002-03 period.In addition, the Leader+ and the national rural development programmes continue, with public funding of €150 million over the 2000-06 period. They support and facilitate the process of rural development, helping to maintain rural communities and to arrest rural depopulation.

Its terms of reference are: to promote the maximum co-operation in the implementation of rural development programmes and on EU programmes; to exchange information on experience and best practice in both jurisdictions in relation to rural development; and to examine the scope for a common approach to the feasibility of developing cross-Border area based strategies and rural development research.In support of its work the committee commissioned two studies in 2001 in relation to co-operation between cross-Border rural communities and cross-Border education, training and research in rural development.

The allocation of €2,385,000 in 2002, originally for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to subhead A7 represented a considerable increase over the provisional outturn for 2001. The main reason for the increase related to the Department's information framework and IT projects.  Clearly there has been no need to cancel or postpone any planned capital projects or consultancies as a consequence.Arising from the major mid-year administrative changes involving the establishment of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the major consultancies now planned for my Department differ from those originally envisaged for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The main consultancies now planned involve the e-Government initiative, the management information framework, human resource management, Gaeltacht client database, Údarás na Gaeltachta's property and equity portfolio and the IT network infrastructure.The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role with regard to consultancies undertaken on behalf of bodies under my Department's aegis.

Where a person who is in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may also be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment at half rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1901	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.In assessing a person's means for the purpose of rent supplement, income either in cash or in kind must be taken into account. Certain sources of income can be disregarded for this purpose but child care costs cannot.Child care costs arise mainly in the context of people taking up employment. Arrangements are in place to enable people taking up employment to retain a proportion of their rent supplement subject to certain conditions. In the cases of people participating in schemes such as the back to work allowance or revenue job assist, the means test has been eased with the result that the household in question can have a higher income and still qualify for rent supplement. The standard means test has also been eased in recent years to enable people taking up part-time employment to retain the first €50 per week.There are no plans at present to disregard child care costs in the SWA means test. The SWA scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluation reviews. The review will examine all aspects of the scheme, including the qualification and calculation criteria relating to rent supplements.

Payment can also be made, at the person's choice, by electronic fund transfer direct to bank accounts. This choice is highlighted for all applicants at the time they make their claims.The payment of pensions by EFT is generally made every two weeks in arrears. Whereas payment by payable order is weekly in advance.Most people who opt to be paid by EFT do so at new claim stage so there is no interruption of the flow of payments once the claim is allowed. Where an existing recipient opts to switch from pension book to EFT the different payment cycle may result in an interruption in payment. Each person, regardless of the payment method, receives the same quantum of payments over the lifetime of his-her claim.When payment of pensions by EFT was introduced in 1993, payments were made every four weeks in arrears. The payment frequency was changed in April 2000 and payments are made fortnightly since then. The question of aligning payment frequencies is under consideration and I intend to make further progress on this issue in 2003.

Accordingly, it was necessary to combine this with his UK insurance to satisfy the 156 paid condition and he was awarded maximum rate pension.

Consequent inquiries by the Department revealed that her employment had commenced two years previously.A deciding officer decided in April to reduce the rate of one parent family payment due to the person concerned for the period from 9 April 1998 to 7 April 1999 in the light of her earnings. The deciding officer also decided to terminate her entitlement completely with effect from 8 April 1999, as her earnings from employment by then exceeded the statutory limit of €15,236.86 or £12,000 for receipt of one parent family payment. It was also found that she had been overpaid by €7,375.38 or £5,808.58 for the period from 9 April 1998 to 18 May 2000 based on her undisclosed means from earnings during that period.The Department notified the person concerned of these decisions and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office if she was dissatisfied.

He does not qualify for a retirement pension as he does not satisfy the statutory qualifying conditions requiring him to have the following: a yearly average of at least 24 contributions paid or credited since 1953 or year of entry into insurance if later, up to the end of the last complete tax year before reaching age 65, and a minimum of 260 full rate employment contributions paid since commencing to pay social insurance.According to my Department's records, the person concerned has a yearly average of 19 over the requisite period and a total of 228 paid employment contributions. His application was refused and he was notified of his right of appeal on 18 July. Had the person concerned reached age 66 between January and April he would have had a yearly average of 19 for old age contributory pension purposes. He would also have been required to have had at least 260 paid employment contributions to qualify for pension.The person concerned will reach age 66 on 9 July 2003. While he will satisfy the average test for a reduced old age contributory pension with an average of 20, he would require a further 32 full rate paid contributions to qualify for pension.

It is open to any dentist who wishes to participate in this scheme. The contract requires the dentist to provide a range of treatments at agreed prices. My Department pays the dentist directly at the contract price for the treatments provided.Oral examination, scaling and polishing are free of charge to the patient under the scheme. The fee the dentist may charge for other treatments, with very limited exceptions, is fixed in the contract. The scheme does not cover orthodontic treatments.Participating dentists agree to treat patients at the contract fee and not to impose charges on patients over the above what the contract allows. This is an essential feature of the scheme and a change involving subsidies to patients and open ended charges for all treatments would fundamentally change the nature of the scheme.The present dispute arose due to the unilateral imposition of increased charges on an open ended basis and in breach of the contractual arrangements for the provision of dental benefit. My Department has advised insured workers through the newspapers to check that their dentist is not imposing increased charges prior to starting treatment. Patients undertaking treatment with dentists engaged in this dispute are doing so outside the scope of the dental benefit scheme and the costs they incur in the circumstances cannot be recouped. Patients have been advised that, where dentists offer to treat people as private patients, this is outside the terms of the dental benefit scheme. Therefore, my Department will not be in a position to refund any costs arising.

He had reached 65 years of age in November 2001. To qualify for a standard rate retirement pension, a person must have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable social insurance contributions over the period from 1953, or from the start of the contribution year in which they entered insurance, if later, to the end of the last full contribution year before reaching age 65.According to my Department's records, the person concerned has a total of 267 reckonable contributions paid or credited over the 47 year period January 1954, the year he entered social insurance, to April 2001. This resulted in a yearly average of six. Accordingly, he does not qualify for retirement pension and he was notified of the deciding officer's decision on 29 August.The person concerned was also insurably employed in the United Kingdom. Details of his UK insurance record have been requested from the British authorities so as to enable his entitlement to an EU pro rata retirement pension to be examined. He will be notified of the outcome of this in due course.The person concerned has also paid self-employment contributions which, although not reckonable for retirement pension, can be taken into account for entitlement to an old age contributory pension at age 66. The person concerned will qualify for a 75% rate old age contributory pension with effect from 22 November, the Friday following his 66th birthday, at the weekly personal rate of €110.50.The person concerned was initially informed that he would qualify for a 50% rate pension. Subsequently further information came to my Department's attention regarding an additional year of self-employment contributions which, when taken into account, results in the higher entitlement.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

The means test has been improved significantly in recent years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. Provision was made in budget 2002 to increase the weekly income disregards to €191 for a single person and €382 for a couple from April. These disregards ensure that a couple with two children and earning a joint income in the region of €22,617 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. Or they can earn up to €36,364 and still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.In addition to these disregards, where the spouse or partner of the carer is employed, the PRSI, union dues and superannuation elements of their earnings are disregarded. An allowance may also be made for travel expenses.Rent and mortgage payments are not taken into account in determining means for carer's allowance purposes. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a direct payment in the form of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent or mortgage interest to persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The carer's allowance is primarily an income support payment rather than a payment for caring. However, carers of more than one incapacitated person are entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment.

This is the maximum rate of allowance payable where one care recipient is being cared for.At the time of her application she also applied for an increase in the rate of her carer's allowance for a second care recipient. This application was refused as the full-time care and attention condition was not satisfied in respect of this additional care recipient.The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal to the SWA office. She subsequently appealed this decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of her appeal.Following an oral appeal hearing the original decision to refuse an increase in her carer's allowance was upheld. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in light of new facts or fresh evidence. The person concerned was notified accordingly.Further medical information was submitted by the person concerned to the SWA office.

People claiming unemployment benefit must provide evidence of identification and address and satisfy conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work. Failure to provide this information on time can result in a delay in processing a claim. Investigations may need to be carried out to establish a person's PRSI contributions or details of their household circumstances which may also result in a delay in processing their claim.Seasonal and other workers who are aware of their impending unemployment can notify my Department in advance and thereby speed up the processing of their claims. Since October 2001 it has been possible to do this, using the Internet, at www.welfare.ie.In September the average time taken from the date of application for unemployment benefit to the date of award was two and a half weeks.Claim processing performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and staff are deployed as necessary to meet the requirements of fluctuating volumes of work. During the summer months staffing levels are normally lower due to annual leave arrangements. Every effort is made to ensure that any reduction in staffing levels does not impact adversely on claim processing times.

It is a means tested scheme with a different method of assessment, including disregards in respect of qualified children, than applied under the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme. Further improvements to the scheme were introduced in October 2000 and rates of payment have been increased each year since its inception. At present there are 8,358 farmers in receipt of farm assist. They receive an average weekly payment of approximately €128.87. In December 2001 it was €106.59 or £83.95 and in September €119.13.For farm assist purposes the assessment of the expected annual income is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. While the income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the position, account is taken of loss of income due to exceptional circumstances. For example, the foot and mouth disease crisis in 2001 or the adverse weather conditions which effected so many farmers earlier this year. This ensure that an assessment accurately reflects the current situation.

It also recommended that this should be phased in over a seven year period.Legislation introduced in 1997 by the Fine Gael-led Government provided for the introduction of this increased requirement in two phases, an increase to 260 contributions from 2002 and 520 contributions from 2012. At the same time the annual average contribution rate required for a minimum old age contributory pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten. Voluntary contributions may count towards the average contributions test but they cannot be used to satisfy the minimum paid requirement.The changes in contribution requirements have been publicised and included in specific information publications dealing with pensions since 1997. They are also available on my Department's website.The original requirement for 156 paid contributions was set in a context where social insurance cover was not as comprehensive as it is today and where income limits had the effect of excluding people from coverage from to time to time. Given the changes in social insurance coverage which have occurred over the past 30 years and which ensure that almost all workers are now covered for contributory pensions, it is considered that a minimum requirement of 260, or five years paid contributions, is a reasonable qualifying condition.Of 19,500 applications for old age contributory and retirement pensions decided in the period April to August, 111 applicants of the total who reached aged 65 or 66 on or after 6 April had their claim rejected by virtue of not having 260 contributions paid. It is not known how many of those disallowed would have had 156 contributions paid.

This pension is a means tested payment and all sources of means, including income and capital, are assessable. The person concerned was requested to furnish details concerning the transfer of assets and the disposal of capital.Despite a number of requests she has failed to provide the relevant information. As a result on 7 May a deciding officer concluded that she was not entitled to a widow's non-contributory pension. If she submits the necessary information her entitlement can be reconsidered.There is no record of my Department having received an application for old age contributory pension.

They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From May 2001, the free schemes were extended to all persons aged 70 years and over regardless of income and household composition.A recent review of the free schemes suggested that the schemes, as currently constituted, provide a basic package of necessary household benefits for the targeted group. It also suggests that no further goods and services should be covered by the schemes.Many private companies extend concessions to pensioners in order to increase their business usage as part of their social aims.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1955	Credited contributions may be awarded to an employed contributor for periods of sickness or unemployment or for attendance at certain courses of training. These contributions have always been a fundamental component of the social insurance system in helping to ensure that a persons insurance record does not suffer because of unexpected contingencies which may arise.Pension forecasts are provided for persons aged 55 years and over who wish to establish their possible entitlement to pension. Atypical cases involve those who may be changing employment moving from public to private sector employment, and consequently a change in employment contribution rate, or from those taking early retirement and considering becoming voluntary contributors so as to maintain eligibility for pension. Forecasts are completed manually mainly due to the fact that insurance records prior to 1979 are not held on computer systems but rather on microfiche tapes.In enacting the changes to the tax year in the Social Welfare Act, 2001, provision was also made to protect insured workers against losses due solely to the change in the contribution year.In general there were no difficulties arising from the change although a small number of cases involving claims to old age contributory pension were adversely affected due to unusual factors not covered by the transitional provisions. I am having the matter examined at present with a view to addressing the problem which arose in these cases.

Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families. Expenditure on family resource centres in 2001 amounted to €2,654,660.There were 50 money advice and budgeting service projects around the country at the end of 2001. These projects provide an advice and budget management service to people in difficulty with moneylending and over indebtedness. Expenditure on the MABS programme in 2001 amounted to €8,267,924.Details of all payments made under the above programmes, to end 2001, have been made available to the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members. Details of the 2002 payments and grants will likewise be made available early in 2003.The Department administers a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, marriage preparation courses, child counselling services in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services.A total of €6.659 million was allocated in 2002 for the further development of this programme. This year 463 organisations benefited from it and over 90% of the funding has been paid out to date. A copy of the schedule, as at April, of organisations who were allocated grant aid under the scheme has been submitted to the Oireachtas Library and is available for the information of Members.A scheme awarding grants towards the development and promotion of second chance education opportunities is designed to assist programmes, projects and initiatives which provide second chance education opportunities to the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. The overall objective is to encourage those target groups to return to education and training as a means of improving their educational qualifications with a view to returning to the labour force. Details of the organisations which received funding under this scheme in 2001 will be provided to the Deputy.

In order to receive it full-time care and attention must be required and provided to the care recipient. The means test which applies must also be satisfied.She was refused the carer's allowance on 6 June on the basis that her weekly means, derived from her spouse's earnings and assessed at €155.45, exceeded the statutory limit for receipt of carer's allowance.She subsequently appealed the decision and her case was referred to the SWA office. The appeals officer upheld the decision and consequently the appeal was not allowed. She was notified accordingly on 1 October. An appeals officer's decision is final and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

The person concerned does not qualify for the fuel allowance for the reason that total household income exceeds the said limit as the person concerned and his wife receive British retirement pensions in addition to the old age contributory pension.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1960	The INOU, in a recent press release, refers to four items, two of which are the responsibility of my Department. These are the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the back to education allowance.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by health board community welfare officers.The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments and participants in approved employment schemes and recognised education and training courses with the cost of children's school clothing and footwear. To qualify for payment, a person's household income must be at or below certain prescribed limits. Details of these limits for this year's scheme are shown in the following tabular statement.The rate of the allowances applicable to this year's scheme are €80 in respect of qualified children aged two to 11 years and €120 in respect of qualified children aged 12 to 22 years.The scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department's series of programme evaluation studies. The review, which is ongoing, is examining all aspects of the scheme.The work carried out in the review showed that the cost of back to school clothing and footwear for children aged 12 or more is considerably greater than the cost for a primary level child and that the differential in the two BSCFA payment rates was inadequate.On this basis a decision was taken in last year's Budget to increase the rate of payment in respect of children aged between 12 and 22 years by 21% to it's current level of €120. I expect to have the review group's final report by the end of the year. The matter raised by the INOU can be further considered in that context.The back to education allowance is payable to successful applicants for the duration of the qualification being pursued, including the summer period between academic years. To qualify for payment of the allowance for the summer period a participant must be progressing to the next year of the qualification being pursued. Payment of the allowance ceases when a participant completes the academic qualification initially applied for.Income limits for 2002 Back to School Clothing and Footwear Scheme

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1963	At the end of September there were 78,344 recipients of one parent family payment. In addition, 13,481 clients were in receipt of deserted wife's benefit-allowance and prisoners' wives' allowance. In aggregate, these schemes include payments in respect of 134,110 child dependants.Each year 18,000 claims for one parent family payment are received. This is equivalent to 350 per week on average. The number of one parent family payments awarded is in the region of 13,000 each year.The average number of weeks to award of new claims following initial receipt for unmarried and separated one parent family payment claims in the year to date are 11 and 16 weeks approximately.The time taken to process new claims varies significantly having regard to the difficulty or otherwise in establishing the circumstances in each case. Administrative work is necessary in respect of each one parent family claim. There is also an onus on claimants to make a claim in the prescribed manner, to furnish all necessary documentation, including birth and-or marriage certificates, details of earnings, and to co-operate with investigating officers during the processing of the claim. In a significant number of cases delays are caused by the fact that the claimant has not provided the certificates or documents required.Every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants have to rely on these alternative forms of support. The vast majority of one parent family payment applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payment normally continues until entitlement to one parent family payment is determined.The length of time needed to decide on claims to one parent family payment does not result in any loss of payment to the people concerned as entitlements are back-dated to the date of initial claim receipt.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1964	Full expenditure returns up to the end of September are not yet available. I can only provide a full comparison of spending against budgeted profile up to the end of July.At the end of July overall Voted expenditure was €46.3 million below profile. The most significant elements of this underspend were on unemployment and related service at €31 million, carer's allowance €9 million, free schemes €6 million, family income supplement €5 million and old age non-contributory pensions €4 million. These underspends arose because demand under these schemes were less than anticipated and partially offset by overspends on other subheads, the most significant of which was supplementary welfare allowances which cost €13 million.At the end of July the Social Insurance Fund expenditure was €33 million above profile. At this stage my Department is not forecasting an end of year overspend on Voted expenditure overall. As I announced earlier this week, the Government approved the payment of a 100% Christmas bonus. This year my Department will again make provision for it from its allocation.

Provision is also made for consultancy assistance in other areas, including policy development. Expenditure on consultancy fluctuates from year to year depending on the number and timing of the major change projects which are being undertaken at any time.In 2001 expenditure on consultancy amounted to just under €5 million. This was less than projected due to the fact that expenditure on one major project to develop and modernise service delivery was substantially lower than estimated.My Department's 2002 Estimate for consultancy expenditure is €11.564 million. Work is proceeding on a number of the projects involved, including the new service delivery model project referred to above. A detailed outline of projects to be undertaken in 2002 will be forwarded separately to the Deputy. My Department has not cancelled or postponed any consultancy or capital projects.
