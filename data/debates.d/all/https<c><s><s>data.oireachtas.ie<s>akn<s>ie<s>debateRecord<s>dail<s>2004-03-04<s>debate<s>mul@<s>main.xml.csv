#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of important national business: the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement following the closure announcement yesterday of the Ridge Tool Company in Cork, this being the third major company closure and loss of jobs in the Cork South-Central constituency since the beginning of this year; and the unacceptable reticence of the Government in recognising and responding to the deteriorating economy in the area.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of local and national importance: the fact that a high quality, purpose built structure at a day centre in Cootehill, County Cavan, has been available to the elderly for almost two years but has never been put into operation by the North Eastern Health Board in a similar way to the centre in Virginia. Cootehill has only been offered services for one day per fortnight. Is it good planning to spend capital on a modern building and yet leave the elderly without a service? This is also the case in Blanchardstown hospital and many others throughout the country, where capital has been spent although the relevant services have not been put into operation.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 7 p.m.; No. 12 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m.The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4.30 p.m., there shall be no Order of Business within the meaning of Standing Orders 26(2) and 26(3), the taking of any divisions shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 9 March 2004 and, accordingly, the following business shall be transacted in the following order: No. 21, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill 2003 [Seanad] — Second Stage (Resumed); No. 5, Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003 — Second Stage (Resumed); No. 19, Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003 — Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 22, International Development Association (Amendment) Bill 2003 — Second Stage (Resumed).

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	As Members know, the Opposition parties have been opposed to guillotines. Is this a proposal to have a guillotine or is it because the Bill has to be introduced by a particular date? Given that some parties have expressed concerns about the Bill, can we have a guarantee that, on Committee Stage, there will be an opportunity to tease out the many amendments submitted by interested groups with large numbers involved in terms of pensions?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	This Bill was initiated in the Seanad where it was debated for six and a half hours. Yesterday it was introduced in the Dáil and there were three and a quarter hours of debate. Today there will be approximately four and a half hours of debate. Discussion on the Bill will resume next Tuesday at 9.30 a.m. so that there will be adequate time to discuss the issues the Deputy has raised and to examine its detail comprehensively.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I want to repeat the point we have made on several occasions about the manner of using Friday sittings. For example, last week the House rose on Thursday at 5 p.m. and there was no sitting on Friday. Without warning, there is to be a sitting this Friday during which there will be no divisions, no Order of Business and no Question Time. No response appears to be forthcoming from the Government to deal with this. It is not an acceptable way to proceed. The House adjourned last week at around 5 p.m., which is the normal time. It will sit tonight until 7 p.m. It is impossible to arrange one's diary to cope with the uncertainty of what might happen. The Friday sitting is not a real one. It is time we addressed this.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I have spoken about the use of the guillotine, the introduction of last-minute amendments and the irrelevance of Friday sittings, yet the practice continues. This is due to a lack of consultation. It seems now to be a common practice that we on this side of the House are not consulted. Our positive and constructive suggestions are ignored.What has happened to the idea of Green Papers? The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has embarked on a new initiative on one-off housing. Many genuinely fear that this represents irresponsible and unsustainable long-term planning with real cost implications for transport, the environment and infrastructure, yet there has been no consultation. I would like to have seen a proper Green Paper and genuine consultation so that we could have avoided the mess on which the Minister is now embarking.

Friday sittings were introduced only in recent years and I do not agree that tomorrow's meeting is useless. Some important measures will be discussed. I am pleased that my measure, the An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, will be dealt with tomorrow. There have been three meetings of the Dáil reform committee in the past three weeks and I wish the committee well.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We continue to receive large volumes of correspondence about the Government's proposal to introduce electronic voting. The Government is due to discuss the European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Bill next Tuesday at its Cabinet meeting. Without any real consultation with the members of the Opposition parties, the Government appointed a panel that it says is independent but which does not include the Ombudsman who is a member of the Standards in Public Office Commission. Can the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is standing in for the Taoiseach, say whether the independent panel must give approval to the process involved? If any member of the panel expresses serious concerns, will the Government defer the project until such time as an electoral commission, for which Deputy Allen has called, can be set up with the support and trust of all the parties?I raised here on several occasions the issue of a debate in this House about a matter which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has raised, namely, that he has information that organised crime is funding a political party in the country.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	25	These questions are not in order on the Order of Business. There are no Leaders' Questions today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Minister for Defence said two weeks ago that he had no objection to this and the Taoiseach said last week that it would not be out of order either. It was raised at the Whips meeting last night but the Minister of State was not in a position to give a guarantee on this. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded to a question from me on this matter and, in the course of his reply, he said that he stood by the comments he made and will continue to do so until it is clear that all paramilitary activity is ended. I do not support Sinn Féin but it is clear that some members of Sinn Féin have never been in the IRA and this matter should be dealt with in the House. Will the Government make time available to deal with these political matters which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has raised publicly and to which he gave a partial response yesterday?There is an ongoing problem in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, whereby farmers in the community——

It runs counter to the programme for Government in which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats said they would make all these facilities available and provide a first-class service to the farming community. This is not happening in County Leitrim where there is a stand-off. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, is a big man and should go down there and sort it out.

The appropriate response regarding the commission on electronic voting is to await the report which is due shortly and to which the Government will give full and due consideration. It would be appropriate for the Whips to seek an opportunity to have a debate in the House on how the proceeds of crime might be used.I am not aware of any legislation pending on the matter in Ballinamore. Teagasc has an annual budget in excess of €100 million to provide a research and advisory service to the agricultural industry. It must modernise that service regularly. Ballinamore is a field station of Teagasc employing approximately three or four people who look after 30 cows. That field station has not published a research paper for many years. It is being streamlined, but the good news for County Leitrim is that additional advisers are being appointed in Mohill, Manorhamilton and Carrick-on-Shannon to provide a top of the range service to the farming and agricultural community in County Leitrim.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The staff in the Ballinamore station are being offered appropriate and no less favourable employment. Yesterday there was a regular meeting of the Teagasc authority — it was not organised to discuss the Ballinamore matter. The authority, which is made up of members of the farming organisations, the IFA, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme, again reaffirmed the decision. It wants to streamline its service and do its best for the agricultural community generally.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I wish the Taoiseach was as forthcoming.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	When will the orders be made for the local and European Parliament elections? Further to the arguments advanced by the Taoiseach for electronic voting, we now hear that the result of European Parliament elections cannot be declared until after 6 p.m. on Sunday. If that is true, it does not attach much urgency to the necessity for e-voting on Friday. Does the Minister for Agriculture and Food not accept that even if we were making a change to the manner in which we do business in this House, for example to change the roster for ministerial questions, the Government would do this after consultation with the Opposition and by a decision of the House?However, the Government is prepared to change something as fundamental as the electoral system, and arbitrarily select and appoint members of a panel to invigilate it, none of whom profess to have any expertise in electronic voting, and two of whom are public servants of high reputation who are being used in a partisan adventure by the Government. What is the rush about all this if we cannot declare the result of the European Parliament elections until after polling booths have closed across Europe on Sunday? Why do we need electronic voting for this election? Can the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is a sensible man, explain the urgency to the House?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	We have made great progress on electronics and information technology generally.

Is this not a further affront to the way we conduct business in the House. It does not seem to matter what happens in the House — the Government will go ahead with it regardless, as one Government backbencher said on a recent programme. Why does the panel not contain people recommended by the Opposition? If the Government was to be truly consultative about this and wanted to get an objective a result, we could have recommended people with real expertise in this area.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this provision. It is timely and appropriate that we discuss the important matter of the provision of pensions. I wish to put on record my appreciation and thanks to the Government for addressing this concern that has arisen in recent years. However, if we were not forward planning and looking to the future, we would have made no efforts to address the problems that will arise from 2020 onwards owing to demographic changes and an ageing population with longer life expectancy. Some of the issues have been addressed already in terms of the introduction of PRSAs.I raised this issue some years go because of my concern that young people in particular, because of the Celtic tiger and their consequential affluence, were not looking to the future and saving to provide for the rainy day and for pensions further down the road. The provision of PRSAs by the Government was very welcome. They made saving attractive for young people at a time when an ideology of invincibility had grown among young people involved in technology stocks and blue chip investments. Many were making a lot of money at an early age and they were not being encouraged to save any of it. They were led to believe that they would never experience poverty, fall ill or grow old and require some pension to sustain them and maintain quality of life in their latter years.That is something that has been addressed through the introduction of PRSAs. There has been a great take-up of these, but it is important to keep driving home the message that while we have a young population the most effective way of addressing the issue of support for them in the years ahead is by getting them involved in pension schemes at a young age when payments are not as large as they would be for people in their mid-40s. If we do nothing else, we should drive home the message that people should invest in pension funds to allow a quality of life as they grow old.The purpose of this Bill is to address two major problems. One is demographic change. We have a very young population, the result of the baby boom of the 1970s and 1980s. That population will begin to grow old from 2020 onwards and we need to make provisions for pension payments. That is the reason for introducing this Bill. Raising the age limit for retirement will allow people who are capable and willing to continue working. It means that people with ability and something to offer can stay within the public service. This is fundamentally important.We have been saying for many years, since the Celtic tiger came about and since unemployment figures dropped, that there is a need to address this issue. Some of our very best, brightest, most experienced public servants must leave the public service, whether they wish to do so, simply because of the age barrier in the public service. This Bill provides for a major change in this area. The Commission on Public Service Pensions had major consultations and dialogue with the various unions and representatives. While this has been happening since 1996 and the publication of the report in 2001, there has not been consensus. We accept that. However, the Government must make a decision for the betterment of all society, not for particular interests. Unions are obviously trying to address the concerns of their members and highlight the issues they want included in any report, decision or legislation. The Government has been fair in addressing the underlying issue of ensuring that enough is put aside, through the pension reserve fund and through this public service superannuation Bill which provides for change in the age of retirement and more flexible arrangements throughout the public sector.We must be honest with ourselves. If we took the short-term view, this would not be an issue for the coming years and we would not be making these changes. Governments must look to the longer term as well. The Government has been forward-looking in discussing issues relevant to the middle of the century, as far ahead as 2056. The Government is looking to the problems of the future and addressing those problems now. France and other countries experienced a similar demographic shift in a short period. Their populations were suddenly older, they had lower birth rates and longer life expectancy. All this culminated in an ageing population dependent on a small ratio of younger people in the workforce. That created huge problems in France and massive industrial problems as well. The French Government addressed the problem by changing the pension entitlements of people who had already retired because of concern that the country could not afford to maintain the current pension payments.People have asked why we are taking the soft option. This is a soft option simply because the Government is making the decision in good time. If it put its head in the sand and did nothing until the issue arose more immediately some time down the road, it would have to make very difficult decisions that would cause much hurt to people who had contributed to pension funds for many years. If the State found it could not continue to pay these pensions we would have major problems. There would be huge industrial problems and huge personal problems for people who had assumed they would have a certain quality of life if the State had to renege on paying pensions. I do not accept that the proposals in this Bill constitute a soft option. It is an option that seems soft simply because it is an option of foresight. The decisions being made today will benefit people in the future.There is concern on the part of the unions. They have expressed their grievances. They have contacted public representatives and made submissions to the commission. Some public sector unions are not happy with some of the changes proposed in this Bill. However, it must be accepted that new entrants to the public service are clearly defined in this Bill. Anybody entering into a contract of employment with the State, through the public sector, on or after 1 April will be fully aware of what will be involved when they reach retirement age, namely, that the latter will be increased and that they will have more flexibility in the later years of their working lives. We should emphasise this in a positive way. We are trying to highlight the importance of people making a full and meaningful contribution in the public sector, in society and in their lives and those of their families. If these people are capable, willing to work and have an ability to contribute, why should they not be allowed that opportunity to continue working?In the past when we had high unemployment rates, there was always the option of trying to encourage people to retire early in order that spaces in the public service could be freed up and new employees recruited. It was a case of churning people out and taking others in. We should try to retain for as long as possible the bank of experience we have developed. This provision will help us to do so.I have already referred to demographics but some of the figures are quite alarming. For example, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has indicated that older people will comprise a larger proportion of the population in the future. At present, there are 430,000 people of pensionable age in Ireland. During the next 17 years, this will increase by 55% to almost 660,000. That is an alarming increase in such a short space of time. If we do not address this matter in the next number of years, we would face major difficulties in trying to pay these people's pensions. The national pensions reserve fund is an integral part of our long-term planning and overall strategy to ensure that we can afford to support people in the public sector when they cease working and go on pension. These people must have available to them the dignity and quality of life for which they planned.We have made many strides forward in recent years, particularly in terms of changes to budgetary and taxation measures designed to encourage people to save their money. We have encouraged people earning good incomes to make their regular pension contributions and also to save more money through other available pension schemes to ensure that they will have a good quality of life and will not be the burden on others that they would have been if they did not take action in this regard. I urge the Minister and those involved in the pension schemes to market this matter in a positive light and encourage people to join such a scheme at an early age. I compare this to young people smoking. One might say to them at 17 or 18 years of age that cigarettes will affect their health but, at that age, it does not make a great deal of sense to them because they believe they are invincible and will never get sick or grow old. At 35 or 40 years of age, however, they may discover that they have cardiovascular difficulties as a result of their smoking. They will look back and state that if they had not smoked, they would not be in that position. The same mentality applies in respect of pensions. We must do whatever we can through taxation changes to encourage people to save money and invest in their pensions.The Commission on Public Service Pensions did a great deal of work. It was established in 1996 and reported in 2001. This body is owed a debt of gratitude for producing its in-depth analysis. The commission was made up of a broad cross-section of people representing the social partners, the various Departments and those involved in the insurance and pensions industries. The Government has taken on board the majority of the commission's recommendations, which is one of the reasons the Bill is before us today.While various unions may have difficulties from the point of view of their members, we must try to address societal and demographic changes as a whole. Everybody concerned must take the broad and long-term view that this issue must be confronted and addressed now to ensure that there is no pain or difficulty in the years ahead. New entrants are clearly defined in the Bill and this makes those entering the public services after 1 April fully aware of what will be involved when they reach retirement age, which will be increased from 60 to 65 in most cases.It is not possible or practical to try to change a pensions system halfway through. On commencing employment, people enter into contracts with their employers — in this case, the State — and certain pension provisions are made for them. It would be unthinkable that, in 2020, 2025 or later, the State would be obliged to renege on the contracts into which it entered with public sector workers and that their pension payments would be changed. The latter happened in France and it is continuing to create problems for that state and its employees.Everyone is conscious of the importance of increasing social welfare and pension payments to elderly people. The Government has made a commitment to try to increase the pension payment to €200 during its term of office. We must ensure that we can afford to do so in a comfortable way and that, by increasing pensions in one area, we do not short-change those in other areas who are entitled to payments. The provisions the Government has made in recent years are coming to fruition in the sense that the Bill has come before the House and the national pensions reserve fund is already in place. Under the Bill, people in the public sector will be able to continue to remain in employment until they reach 65 and, in some cases, beyond, particularly if they are capable, willing and want to contribute.We have planned ahead and I hope that those who oppose us and have concerns will consider the fact that the Government is making the decision for everyone. It is in the best interests of everybody to make these decisions now as opposed to doing so down the road. While individual unions and sections of the public sector have highlighted their concerns, there is no doubt that we have, in general, taken a balanced and long-term approach.I compliment and place on record my thanks to everybody who sat on the Commission on Public Service Pensions. They faced an arduous task by becoming involved in this huge undertaking. The commission issued many good recommendations and the Government has taken most of them on board. Such action is a compliment to the commission and its approach which entailed bringing everyone into the loop and discussing and explaining the issues. It was not merely a case of the commission obtaining submissions from a few people and drawing up a report for submission to the Government. The commission's approach was detailed and well thought out from the point of view of extracting information and its report was well presented.I commend the Bill to the House. I thank the Minister and those involved in this area in recent years. While members of the Opposition might complain about the fact that we have been in Government for so long, it is at times like this they must accept that it is important to have continuity on this side of the House in order that there is a follow through regarding decisions that are made and commissions that are established. The Bill, the national pensions reserve fund and the various tax changes in recent years aimed at encouraging people to save are representative of the continuity of Government, policy and personnel in the different Departments. This continuity has helped us to begin to address the alarming problems with which we would be faced in the future.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, must be commended because he highlighted this matter many years ago when in Opposition. It was part of our policy platform before the 1997 general election that, in the event of our returning to Government, this issue would have to be addressed. I do not wish to make political points about something that will happen in the future regarding changes in public sector pension services. However, some Opposition parties accused us of having election slush funds, etc.Before the previous general election, the parties in Opposition stated that, if they got their hands on the reins of Government, they would use money from the national pensions reserve fund for various projects. The Government has made a commitment, through the enactment of legislation, to ensure that a fixed percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, would be invested in the pension reserve fund every year, whereas members of the Opposition have indicated that, if elected to Government, they would loot and pillage the fund which was established to address the concerns, fears and anxieties of many people whose pensions the State may otherwise not be able to afford. I highlight this point to show the paradox of Deputies who have accused the Government of not planning sufficiently for the future stating in the same breath that they would plunder the national pensions reserve fund.I thank everybody involved in the presentation of the Bill and commend it to the House.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on pensions legislation. The Labour Party is supportive of Government efforts to address the issue of pensions and supported the establishment of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. Having said that, we oppose the Bill because we do not support aspects of it, specifically those which were not agreed by the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. While it is important to make provisions such as those in the legislation, many of which we support, it is being pushed through without agreement having been reached in the working group established following the publication of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. As such, the Bill is a betrayal of the spirit of partnership.As the previous speaker stated, it is important that Government introduces provisions of this nature for the future. Pension provision is also an issue for all European countries, and the establishment in 1996 of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which reported in January 2001, was necessary. It is important, however, to examine the subsequent sequence of events to explain the reason the Labour Party opposes the Bill.Following publication of the commission's report, a working group was established comprising representatives of employers and the public service unions under the aegis of the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Sustaining Progress referred to the working group and suggested it should report by April 2003. However, no agreement had been reached in the working group by that date and further discussions, which followed in the autumn of 2003, also failed to reach agreement. The Minister for Finance then announced the Government's decision on public service pensions in his budget speech of 2004, effectively railroading it through against the express wishes of ICTU. That is the background to the legislation.I was made aware of the concerns of the trade union movement in October 2003 when the matter was brought to my attention by the teaching unions. I subsequently wrote to the Minister for Education and Science who transferred my correspondence to the Minister for Finance. The Minister wrote to me outlining his plans to announce in the budget the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to take a decision on the teaching profession and other groups, despite the objections of the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.As I stated, this amounted to a betrayal of the spirit of partnership because agreement had not been reached. The teaching unions are especially concerned about the provisions of the Bill and, as my party's spokesperson on education and science, I will focus on addressing their concerns. Concern is not confined to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation which has spoken to almost every Member of the Oireachtas about the legislation. All the teaching unions are concerned about the measures, including those which affect the entire public service.The increase in the minimum pension age, for example, will apply to all new entrants to the public service, including civil servants and those working in education, local government and the health services. I will comment briefly on psychiatric nurses later because they are particularly adversely affected by the legislation. Other health professionals and staff in the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies are also covered by the provision on retirement age.I am concerned about teachers because they will be required to work until the age of 65 years before they are eligible for a full retirement pension. I am also concerned about the effect this will have on children in the classroom. When the teaching unions raised this issue with my party, they pointed out that only a small number of teachers will face difficulties arising the provision to preclude them from taking early retirement from the profession. On the other hand, difficulties will arise for many children being taught by teachers who should be retired, whether due to stress — teaching is a stressful occupation — or other reasons.I do not speak as someone with a great deal experience in teaching as I taught for only two years in what could be described as the public service, although I also did some pre-school teaching, an area outside the remit of the legislation. I speak from my experience as a parent and from listening to other parents and teachers. When a teacher should not be in the profession, especially if or she knows this, it can result in major changes in the lives of children and their attitudes to school and education.This is especially true of primary schoolchildren, who spend a full school year with a teacher, and infants, specifically those in their first year who commence school with enthusiasm, bright eyed and bushy tailed with their new bag and books and so forth. If a teacher should not be teaching due to personal problems with the profession, it will colour the attitude of such children to school with the possible result that they decide they do not want to go to school. These attitudes can stay with children for the rest of their educational life and will obviously affect the rest of their lives, given that one's life chances are largely determined by one's success at school.For this reason, it is probably more important for parents and children than the teacher in question that teachers should not be compelled to remain in the classroom in circumstances in which they should be retired. For every teacher affected, as many as 30 children in his or her class will be affected.This leads me to the stressful nature of teaching. Teachers must deal with large groups of children in among the largest classes in Europe. They must also deal with social behaviour which has changed significantly since the Deputies present attended school, although I note the presence of two relatively young Deputies who probably went to school much later than I did. As recently as yesterday, I spoke to a teacher who described the kind of abuse and language teachers must now listen to in schools and the kind of pressures they are under. Even a few troublemakers in a class can change its atmosphere and make it extraordinarily difficult for a teacher to do the job he or she is employed to do, namely, to teach.Much of teachers' time is spent simply maintaining control. Young people have the capacity to disrupt a class in a manner not possible in the past when there was a much greater respect for authority. It is a fact of life that the social system, including respect for gardaí, teachers and various other authority figures — I could mention politicians — has changed dramatically. Teachers have to cope with that in the school setting. I am convinced there is a genuine case to be made to allowing teachers to retire early. The general retirement scheme which currently provides that one must retire at 60 years of age is being changed to 65 years and the early retirement scheme is limited. There is a particular case to be made for the teaching profession.Another issue specific to teachers relates to young people currently in teacher training. The Bill exempts trainees in the Garda training college in Templemore from the changes being made in this legislation. Obviously, as other speakers said, people already in public service employment are also exempt. There is every good reason trainee gardaí should be exempted from these provisions and I fully support the Minister in that regard. Will the Minister apply that exemption to trainee teachers? A person attending a university or institute of technology has various professional options but those who attend teacher training colleges do so because they have chosen to become teachers. Such people are, therefore, already linked to the profession. An amendment in this regard has been tabled for Committee Stage in the Seanad and I understand one will also be tabled during Committee Stage in this House. This matter was raised with me yesterday by a student from St. Patrick's College when I and many other Deputies met student union representatives. I ask that the Minister apply the exemption to students already in teacher training.Many of the concerns expressed by teachers also affect other professions. One such issue is the exemption for those categorised as re-entrants provided they return no later than 26 weeks following the last day of service prior to 31 March. The case is made that the legislation will apply retrospectively to people who were not aware this legislation was being introduced and who have been out of service for a period longer than six months. I ask the Minister to ensure such people are enabled to return to service after 1 April. It is only fair they are not affected because they were out of service for more than 26 weeks.People with a long service record of not less than 15 years who return to service should also be recognised. I am referring in this instance to women, and possibly men, who have taken time out for parenting duties, many of whom would be teachers though not all because it also applies to other public servants. The Minister should ensure the legislation is family-friendly and should facilitate those who have taken such time out. I had an opportunity to be at home when my children were young. I would not wish on anyone the possibility of not being able to take time out. Pressures on young parents are greater now than in the past because of high mortgages and the difficulties encountered when running a home on one income. A parent who makes the sacrifice and decides in the best interests of his or her family to take time out, should not be penalised when he or she reaches pension age. I ask the Minister to take that point on board.The proposals I have put forward are valid and will not be costly in terms of overall savings. The Minister, in his budget speech, said it was estimated that the annual savings which will arise from the introduction of the pension changes will be approximately €300 million in current terms in 30 to 40 years time, with some savings being realised earlier. I commend the Minister for saving money whenever he can. It would not cost a great percentage of that figure to make the changes requested by the teachers' unions in particular although these issues also affect other professions.Psychiatric nurses, who obtained rights under earlier pension schemes, will be more affected by this provision than others in the health sector though it will affect general nurses, doctors and others. Psychiatric nurses do a demanding job and work under enormous pressure. They work on a day-to-day basis with people who, by their definition, have psychiatric problems and can be extraordinarily difficult to deal with on a personal level. Many psychiatric nurses suffer physical assault and are faced with physical danger and psychological stress. It is a difficult profession. Again, I believe their case should be listened to.Changes are also being made for gardaí, prisoner officers and the Defence Forces. One could make the case that these are difficult areas in which to work. I understand the Minister has to put money aside and the Labour Party does not have a problem with the broad thrust of the public service pensions commission's remit and the majority of its recommendations. It is good to plan for the future. These are human issues; they are not something we might talk about in terms of broad policy objectives. We are talking about individual human beings who are inappropriately placed in the caring professions and who, through no fault of their own, may not be able to retire early and who may cause problems for those in their care be they children in school, psychiatric patients or others being cared for in the health services.The Minister should consider these proposals in the interests of society and the particular individuals mentioned. I assume the Minister also met the INTO and other unions concerned about this issue. I hope he listened to what they said and will take their genuine concerns on board. They are not just making a case for themselves because those who made representations on this matter are people already employed in the public service who will not lose out or be affected by the changes. They do not argue this case for selfish reasons, their motives are altruistic. They are concerned about their professions and for those coming after them who may have even more difficult and stressful issues with which to deal in the future. Things are already moving in that direction and may continue moving that way. These are, by and large, caring professions whose influence is much wider than their health and stresses. They affect others with whom they come into contact in their role as carers.I ask that the Minister consider these issues in a human way and that he be sympathetic to amendments which my colleague, Deputy Burton and other spokespersons, will table on Committee and Report Stages.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I wish to share time with Deputy Mulcahy. It is slightly surreal to speak on legislation, the effect of which will not be felt for another 30 years. Few of us can hope to be around when its effects are realised. This legislation is a far-sighted measure on the part of Government in that it is laying the groundwork for solving the problems of the future. This problem has already manifested itself in Europe, particularly in northern Europe, in demographic changes. It is normally characterised as a time-bomb and it has become something of a cliché to talk about the pensions requirement growing here.We are in the fortunate position of having experienced a period of growth and wealth that allows us to plan as well not have the same problems as the northern European countries. Principally this is because we have the social tradition of southern Europe in countries like Spain and Italy in the sense that our older people are still cared for by their families to a much greater extent than is the case in northern Europe. The pressures on the State, therefore, to provide for the care of the elderly is not as great now as it is in our neighbouring countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, the worker to pension ratio is much lower than it is here.The planning for the future with which the Government is to be credited will not only extend to this legislation, which is short but far-sighted, but it is seen in the national pensions reserve fund which is operated independently of the Minister. It has been effectively sanitised from political influence and bar that the Committee of Public Accounts can call the fund to task for any of its activities, it is without political influence. That is appropriate.One per cent of GNP is a very significant amount of money. That it is GNP and not GDP means it is an even greater sum of money because GDP includes repatriated profits in respect of foreign companies here. The national pensions reserve fund is another branch of this forward thinking and far-sightedness of the Government. This fund cannot be touched until 2025 and that effectively allows Governments to plan ahead to the year 2055. In 2055, if God spares me, I will be in my late 80s. That is why I said it is slightly surreal to talk about the impact of legislation before the House today which will bear fruit in so many years' time.The Employment Equality Authority has identified that of the issues complained about to the authority, 10% are related to age discrimination. That indicates that we need to make some serious changes in work practices, as well as deal with the legislation before us today. The National Economic and Social Forum recommends wide-ranging changes in work practices to reflect the greater pressures for the elderly.A large number of reforms should be promoted by the Government in the not too distant future. Already we are seeing specific housing policies for the elderly to allow them stay at home for the longest possible time and in so far as these policies are successful, it relieves the burden on the Government and enhances the quality of life for elderly people.In the health strategy we need to prioritise the provision of home help services for the elderly. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has provided for primary care physicians, which helps older people to stay at home for longer periods. He is already in consultation with my health board area to deliver this service in a more wide-ranging fashion.Work practices need to be greatly improved. We have to provide incentives, in particular flexible working hours, in the future to encourage people to stay in the workplace.An issue I have raised a few times in the House is the role of the elderly in the partnership process. I am aware some influence is being brought to bear to try to include representatives of the elderly population in the partnership process and I hope they will be included in all future negotiations in that regard.I would also like to see an extension of the applicable age limit in the Employment Equality Act from the current age of 65. If we are to introduce these wide-ranging reforms in the working population, we have to increase the ambit of the Employment Equality Act so that it will protect those over the age of 65.The Law Reform Commission has also recommended changes in regard to vulnerable adults, and I hope we will be able to make those changes.There was some comment about the drop in the ratio, to which I referred earlier. In this country it is something like 5:1, which is a much better ratio than that in other countries. For example, in the UK it is 3.4:1. It is predicted that 50 years from now it will be 2:1 here and in just ten years it will be 2:1 in the UK. We should not panic unduly about the drop in the ratio for two reasons. First, work practices have become far more productive in the past decade or so. Workers are producing more than they have in previous times, and as a result we are not really comparing like with like. It is also relevant to point out that we have a much larger migrant population and we need to encourage that. I have spoken about that issue previously.Deputies have referred to younger Members of the Oireachtas and how this measure will affect new entrants after 1 April 2004. It does not apply to me but will apply to a person of my age coming into the House who perhaps faces the prospect of a short political career. The constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire, can be volatile and is not in the habit of returning the same five Deputies. It is a sword one may have to fall on in due course. Is it unreasonable for a Deputy to expect some kind of pension entitlement, given the increasingly precarious nature of our job? That should not be the case. We should not be entitled to pensions at young ages when other members of the population are not entitled to them. Nobody comes into this House on the basis of the attractive financial arrangements, whether by way of salary, entitlements or pensions. Most people, if not all, who come into this House have other careers and are able to fall back on those careers to some extent after they leave the House. It is proper and right that the Members of the Oireachtas always have that characteristic. The idea of a career politician is not a good one. If Members have something to fall back on they do not feel the pressure to stay here at all costs. If one at least has something to fall back on one knows one can hang on to some of the principles one came in here with. Politicians do not hope to stay here at all costs. They have an ambition to see their principles through and if that means putting their political careers in jeopardy, so be it. That is not something we should try to stitch into legislation.On the question of teachers, I spent seven years working as a teacher at post-primary level. I acknowledge the point Deputy O'Sullivan made and I have listened to many teachers on this issue. In the schools in which I taught there were many teachers who were over 60 years of age but who were extremely valuable members of the staff. There is a provision in section 10 to allow teachers suffering from ill health to take up their pensions at an earlier age. As regards flexibility, where a teacher suffers stress — there is no question that it arises in teaching more than in other professions — that should be acknowledged as a ground of ill health and the person should be allowed to retire, accordingly, with dignity and a full pension. Such an approach benefits both teachers and students. I will conclude on that and commend the Bill to the House.

It is an extremely important issue. This Bill primarily deals with public sector pensions. The Minister, who has been in office for a fair number of years in comparison with several other Ministers for Finance, has made many other changes to pensions in the private sector. I hope the private sector is not ignored in this debate. People in the public service have security of tenure and their pensions are secure. That is not the case throughout the private sector. When debating the principles of this Bill there are issues which should be borne in mind with regard to the private sector.I welcome the Bill because it gives legislative effect to the Commission on Public Service Pensions. One of the Bill's great triumphs is that it attacks the old concept of ageism. That is——

Anyway, I do not want to trivialise the debate by going into that issue. The most important point in this Bill for me is that it abolishes the link for new entrants between age and compulsory retirement in most areas of the public service. I am not sure where that leaves current employees in the public sector, whether they will be forced to retire at the age of 65. If they are, why not change it for everybody from 1 April 2004? Why not let people who are in the public service at this stage work on past the age of 65?The first thing I welcome about the Bill is that it scotches the notion that an employee is finished at the age of 65. However, in so far as this will apply to the public sector, will the Minister please ensure that it also applies to the private sector, because employees, aged 65, are being forced out of business and made to retire? That is, in effect, an ageism principle. Somebody came to my advice clinic recently who had an independent contract with a statutory company established by the State. I looked into the matter and, although this man was in the fullness of his health and had passed the various eye tests and so on, he was told that he could not continue with his contract over a certain age. That is wrong. The principle should be if someone is in the fullness of health and passes the various eye checks and so on, he or she should be able to carry on business with public companies for as long as he or she is capable. I accept of course that some general guidelines must be in place, for example where public safety is concerned. I ask the Minister to look at the whole question of the inter-relationship between private contractors and the public service, with reference to the question of ageism.Public servants, including politicians, are lucky to have such a high level of pension benefit. The Minister made the point in a speech recently that it would take an enormous sum of money paid into a private sector pension fund to get the type of annual pension payment that somebody in the public service gets. It is a generous benefit indeed. This issue needs to be looked at in greater depth in the private sector. It is a scandal that low paid workers are ignored in their pension entitlements by many private sector employers. In recent years construction workers have complained that their pension contributions were not being paid by employers. That is a terrible scandal. Any employer who does not fulfil his or her contractual pension obligations to employees should face serious consequences, if not imprisonment. It is not good enough that those low paid vulnerable workers can be exploited by people and not given their proper entitlements.Neither does the Bill deal with the self-employed. The Minister, over his long tenure as Minister for Finance — I hope it continues for a few more years — has made several significant changes with regard to private pension entitlements. For example, formerly when a person reached the age of 65 or 70 — I cannot remember which — he or she had to buy an annuity. The Minister abolished that so that an employee may now take 25% in cash on retirement and buy an annuity with the remaining 75%. Formerly, if the person died early into retirement the life assurance company gobbled up all that money and made extraordinary profits. The Minister changed that rule and now the estate will get the money and not the life assurance company. That is a significant change.The Minister has also helped to create PRSAs, which is the start of mobility in pensions. Further pension reform is needed. I agree with the point made by Deputy Richard Bruton in his contribution, much more pension mobility is needed between the public and private sectors. Just as there is to be a so-called "mortgage passport", there should also be a pension passport. If an employee spends two years in the private sector, then goes to the public sector and back to the private sector, all the time his or her pension entitlements should be protected. I believe more work has to be done and more imagination brought to that area.I welcome in particular the Bill's anti-ageism measures. People are healthier and live longer. It is not unreasonable that in general 65 should be the minimum age for receiving a pension. There will have to be exceptions such as fire fighters, gardaí, prison officers etc., and I am glad to see that politicians are included. I do not see why politicians should get special treatment over anyone else. We are employees in the public service and I am glad we are not receiving preferential treatment.My final word is on the national pension reserve fund. The continuing criticism and carping from Fine Gael and the Labour Party is completely undeserved. Deputy Bruton——

If only the same forward-thinking applied to other areas of Government policy and he took a similar 50 year view on energy policy and the introduction of a carbon tax. Mr. Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve, whom the Minister would respect, was asked by a Congressman in a congressional committee if they should look at a five or ten year horizon and he stated that people should think about a 40-year horizon. I am glad we are doing that now but it is lamentable that the Minister does not take the same long-term view when it comes to the environmental issues that are looming and will not amend decisions in other areas to reflect that.Deputy Andrews said that he was glad the Pensions Board does not reflect any bias and is sanitised from political control. Looking at the portfolio the Pensions Board holds for 50 years' time, it is incredibly biased towards a narrow definition of where wealth generation will occur and where secure investments exist. The massive over-allocation of funds to a small number of stocks in the US and European markets is incredibly risky for the public sector workers who will rely on the fund in future. It would be far better and more secure if there was a broader spread of assets and investments in the pension fund into wealth generating assets in our own country which the Government refuses to fund, be that public transport or other infrastructural projects that we would like to see supported in the pensions fund. I totally disagree with Deputy Mulcahy that putting everything in Exxon Mobil and Microsoft stock is a clever way to invest for the future of public servants.There is an incredible provision for and attention to public sector pensions on the part of this and previous Governments and nothing like the same allocation for private sector workers. This Bill is important to teachers, gardaí and other public sector workers but there is a real issue in the private sector about the failure to provide proper pensions on a similar basis. The difference in treatment and the fact that this large pension fund is getting so much attention and such resources is very well for those in the public sector but does nothing for those in the private sector who will not have recourse to the fund in later years.This imbalance reflects a greater imbalance in Government policy as set by the partnership process. If a person is within the golden circle of Government decision making and represented by IBEC or one of the large public sector unions, he will do well under the partnership process. If, however, he is outside the circle, a small employer or environmental group which is not represented in the process, his thoughts and concerns are given no weight.

I agree with that but, likewise, there should be no compulsion in the system that a person has to stay until 65.This new compulsion to stay to that later age, which the Bill will encourage by the pension only coming into effect when 65 is reached, will not be good for the education system.There is concern among teachers about the type of education system we are developing. Our education system is best served by encouraging a more flexible work arrangement system which sees people entering and leaving the profession as their lifestyles suit them instead of a compulsion to stay to a certain age to secure pension benefits. That would attract the people we need into the profession, those who are motivated and energised by their jobs. Teaching is an energised and energetic job, it is not one which can be done well without motivation. To hold the attention of 25, or in certain scandalous cases 35, students is something that a person cannot be compelled to do well if he is not ready to take on that task.We have done the right thing in some instances. Some teachers I know availed of the five year career gap that was instituted in the 1980s. That was an excellent example of State flexibility that benefited the teachers by allowing them to take a break and explore other areas and if they come back to teaching, they do so because they are committed to the career and they have been re-energised. That was of great benefit to the education system and the individuals involved.We should introduce more of that flexibility into teachers' jobs. Maternity leave for parents who are teachers should be much longer and teachers should be given a five year break to spend those crucial early years rearing children. It would be good for the children, the parents and the education system.I have no difficulty with a teacher working at 65. If someone thinks he or she is able to keep going years after, I see no reason he or she should not continue, perhaps with fewer hours. We will need such a flexible approach to personnel management in the education system if we are to attract the best people in the country to that job because it is the area where we need the best people.Over the years we have constantly stated that our young people are our greatest asset and the education system has brought us much of our wealth. The Government, however, believes its own propaganda that measures introduced by the Minister for Finance brought about our prosperity. This prosperity was brought about by the investment over 40 years in the education system and our young people. It gave us a flexible workforce that could adapt to the modern economy. Unless we make sure we have the best teachers, we will lose that competitive advantage. To attract such people we cannot state that a person must work X years with the same work and conditions without flexibility. That is not good personnel management.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I am happy to have a few minutes to address this Bill. The national pensions reserve fund, or at least a significant proportion thereof, could be much better used for the good of the country by investing it in the provision of infrastructure to ensure continued development and job creation, thereby reflecting a healthy economy which will be able to fund pensions for both public and private sector workers in future. I am thinking in particular of transport. Our bus and rail services are seriously substandard and need to be upgraded and extended significantly. Examples would be rail services in the south-east, such as the Limerick-Waterford-Rosslare line, in the western corridor and various other services.There is also a need for infrastructural development in education and health. We all know of the huge backlog of work in the extension and refurbishment of existing schools and the building of new ones. It appears from what we have seen from the Department of Education and Science that many schools which need urgent refurbishment and extension or new buildings will have to wait years before these are provided.Regarding health, in the town of Clonmel in my constituency, facilities needed for the expansion of general surgical services have been provided but have remained unopened for the past 12 months. They are like a white elephant. There is no indication that these services will be available in the near future. A significant portion of the funds earmarked for pensions should be used to make them available.The Bill represents a sea-change in the attitude towards the public service. The introduction of a compulsory pensionable retirement age of 65 across the public service is unacceptable and unfair. It reflects the Government's ethos of commercialisation, marketisation, privatisation and bringing everything down to its value in euro and cent — or pounds, shillings and pence, as we would have said. The compulsion of making people serve up to the age of 65 is unwise, unfair and unacceptable. Some of these proposals came from the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I am disappointed by the input from the union side in that regard. There has certainly not been consultation with the membership on it, and there is significant opposition among the membership of the main unions affected by the measure, including the nursing and teaching professions and the clerical and administrative grades in local authorities and health services. These people are now being forced to work up to the age of 65 before they get a pension.My background is in local authorities and the health service where I worked for about 30 years. I can tell the House first-hand that forcing someone such as a psychiatric or general nurse in a public hospital, or a teacher, to work to a pensionable age of 65 is impractical and unwise. It says to me that those proposing these changes have no hands-on information or experience of what happens in those professions. Let us consider psychiatric nurses. They deal daily with difficult circumstances on a one-to-one and group basis with patients. Over the years, it has been quite properly accepted that the work that they do is of such a pressurised nature that they should be allowed to reach retirement age earlier than would usually be the case. That should continue.A general nurse must work in one of our overcrowded hospitals with patients on trolleys in corridors. Accident and emergency departments are overcrowded. In the case of Cork University Hospital this week, 35 patients were on trolleys. Despite this, we are suggesting that those nurses work to the age of 65 to get a pension. That is unacceptable, unwise and impractical. We will find that significant numbers of public servants, especially in nursing and education, will find it impossible to continue to that age. I have no difficulty where a person wishes to continue to the age of 65 or later if he or she wishes to do so and opts for that voluntarily. However, this Bill introduces a compulsion to work for 65.There is another element in the Bill which needs to be addressed specifically, namely, the question of re-entry to the service. With minor exceptions, anyone who has left the service and re-enters will now be subject to the new provisions. For instance, female professionals with children who, in the belief that they must accord some time to family life, give up working for a certain period and afterwards return to the profession will now find themselves affected by the new proposals in this Bill. That is especially unfair to female members of the nursing and teaching professions and the administrative and clerical grades in the Civil Service.There is also the question of student nurses and teachers who have come into the system on that basis before 1 April 2004. They will now be brought into the system under the new provisions of this Bill. Those cases in particular have been accepted into the system for a specific purpose. Anybody who entered that system before 1 April this year should not be subject to the provisions of this Bill.

I accept that many people look forward to retirement, although perhaps Deputy Healy is looking forward to it with greater expectancy than the rest of us.Most people are defined by their work. There are conferences and organisations dedicated to what is benignly described as the work-life balance. The bottom line is that work is an important component of what people do; it is an important part of their personality. That applies to older people too. In the majority of cases older people do not particularly look forward to retiring and to being alone, doing little other than recreation. That is the experience in the modern world. We are increasingly calling on the wisdom and experience of older people and encouraging them back into the workforce to lend the expertise which they have developed over the years.The objective of this Bill is to reform the pensions regime. It allows people to work beyond the pension age, which is a most enlightened change. I was amused when Deputy Healy said there would be a compulsion to work to the age of 65. There is no compulsion.

Indeed, if one makes an advanced contribution over a lifetime, one can pick the age at which one wishes to retire. That facility still exists. The Minister is not forcing anybody to do anything.However, it is typical of the left wing approach, and a singular obsession of the Opposition Members, to condemn almost anything the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, does as harsh, right wing and ideological, even if it is actually left wing. It is a cliché at this stage. This is enlightened legislation which takes account of the changing demographic picture of modern Ireland.An instructive report was produced by National City Brokers some years ago which predicted our future prosperity and, to an extent, the extraordinary boom we experienced in the years from 1998 to 2001. It predicted that the prosperity would be sustained up to 2020. There is no magic or rocket science involved in this. It is due to the simple fact that the demographic structure in Ireland has become extraordinarily benign in recent years. There should be sustained economic growth up to the year 2020 because of the strong ratio between the number of people working and the number of people who are dependent on those working. That is known as the dependency ratio. It is benign and helpful at present. The bulk of our population is categorised as able-bodied and willing to work and that is contributing enormously to the economic success we currently enjoy.It contrasts strongly with the 1970s and 1980s, which are often described as a period of economic failure in our recent history. In that period, there was an extremely high dependency ratio. In other words, there were many people going through the full-time education system or they were of pensionable age. The Minister is trying, in an enlightened fashion, to ensure we will not have a pensions crisis in 2020.The thrust of his policies to date has been to encourage people to provide for their future and to take responsibility for their pensions by making advanced voluntary contributions and by increasing the retirement age. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with making people work longer to achieve their pensions. It is a positive thing.

Sometimes these things must be changed so people can benefit in the future. Politics is not always defined by the attitude of, "What is in it for me?" This is a long-term measure to provide for the future of this country and for future generations who are willing to work well into their 60s and, if possible, into their 70s and 80s. It depends on whether they have the mental and physical capabilities and the desire to do so. Much in this area is driven by people's desire and that is reflected in the provisions of the Bill.The Minister has revolutionised the pensions regime in this country. People are now taking responsibility for their future in a way that could not have been envisaged five or ten years ago because the economic paradigm was unsuccessful. We are now able to do it. The Minister established the national pensions reserve fund, which has been criticised by the Opposition, as well as the savings scheme. These are important measures for saving and providing for the future. They ensure that when a person reaches a certain stage in life, he or she will have put away sufficient money because he or she will have absorbed the culture of saving and providing for himself or herself.These are the types of robust values that built the great Sinn Féin movement which secured the independence of this country in the period between 1918 and 1922. The worthy and robust values of self-reliance joined Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together and united the Irish people. There was no political division between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the two parties, as well as the Labour Party, contributed enormously to the freedom and independence of this country on the basis of those values. The aim was to build and provide for our future, ourselves alone, and to look after ourselves first and look elsewhere when we could influence matters there.Those values underlie the pension reforms and the savings culture which the Minister is attempting to introduce. We do not want a consumerist culture of continuous spending in which people forget about the bills that loom over the horizon and just spend for today. That can spike consumer spending, which can be a dangerous economic development, to such an extent that it can become inflationary and wasteful of the public and private resources we now undoubtedly possess.I was intrigued by Deputy Eamon Ryan's contribution. He is already harmonising the Green Party's position with that of Fine Gael with regard to partnership. For many years, including under the leadership of Deputy John Bruton prior to his entry into Government in 1994, Fine Gael was a strong critic of the partnership process.Earlier we spoke about the values people should have and hold. However, as soon as Deputy John Bruton was in power, abandoned his opposition to partnership and discovered it was something fabulous in which to be involved.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Some people make breath-taking changes in their intellectual, ideological and political policy make up, but this change should be studied in order to understand fully the crisis in which Fine Gael finds itself today. Fine Gael had a leader who was avowedly a Christian democrat but who declared 18 months later that he was leading a fantastic social democratic Government. That is a contradiction beyond comprehension.It is mirrored in Fine Gael's attitude to partnership. While Fine Gael abandoned its opposition to partnership when in Government, now that it is again in opposition it has declared it is against benchmarking. It is interesting, if we can believe Deputy Eamon Ryan as representative of the Green Party, that the Green Party is now twinning its policy with that of Fine Gael. He is critical of the partnership process, not because the awards were too generous to those who provide our public services but because eco-warriors, environmentalists or cranks of one kind or another are not represented in the partnership talks.That is untrue. The partnership process is fully inclusive and includes the community and voluntary pillar, the trade unions, employers, farmers, etc. In addition, every partnership deal agreed is voted on and debated by this House. It is not true to say that people such as environmentalists are not represented. They are represented in this House and therefore in the process. Ultimately, the partnership process is sanctioned by the Executive and then put to this House. The predominance of the negotiation may take place outside the House but it must still come into the House to be approved, sealed and rubber-stamped.

If I, or Deputy Crawford I suspect, were asked our views, we would be quite happy that the eco-warriors were not at the negotiating table for the partnership talks. They would go on for a decade if those boys and girls were included. There is a limit to the inclusivity one can engender and allow when set against the urgent need to arrive at agreements which will stick and deliver for public servants and others in terms of pay increases.This Minister has been extraordinarily reforming in the area of pensions and provision for our future. The hallmark of his period in office has been that he has refused to just tinker with the works but has gone boldly for strong reform, even when it hurts. Let us be honest about it. If I was asked what I think of the effects of the legislation on new public representatives elected after the next general election, I would say it is somewhat unfair to them because they will not enjoy the same pension entitlements I or Members of the current Dáil enjoy because we were elected by the sovereign people in the election of 2002. However, it is right that our pension arrangements are harmonised with those that obtain outside the House.We all know that when there is a glaring mismatch between the way we treat ourselves versus what the public can expect in normal employment, private or public, it leads to and breeds a sort of cynicism about politics. I am glad this change is happening and that our particular pension arrangements will now be harmonised with those pertaining outside the House.The Minister's enlightened approach shows he is not afraid to discriminate which is an important principle. By its nature economic policy, particularly tax and pension policy, is about discrimination. Many people in this modern, politically correct age believe that everything should be neutral and nothing should discriminate. However, economic and social policy is very much driven by the concept of the State actively discriminating in favour of some and against others. In this respect, this Bill does discriminate in terms of the treatment of the position of the Taoiseach and what the Taoiseach, and future Taoisigh, do and will enjoy. That may be a comfort to Deputy Enright who with youth on her side, may be Taoiseach in 20 years.

He or she will be fully entitled to his or her pension immediately on ceasing to be Taoiseach. This is proper and appropriate because we should treat the office in a special and particular way. The great fallacy of this modern period of political correctness is that economic policy should never discriminate and nobody should have an advantage to which he or she is not fully entitled over somebody else. This is somewhat wrong. We do have to discriminate. We do have to decide on a policy or priority for the future from 2020.On Second Stage the Minister said we currently have five people working for every one pensioner but by the year 2021 that figure will have declined to two workers for every pensioner. This illustrates the glaring requirement to move forward and provide for pensions earlier, and the need to help people to work longer and provide for their pensions if they fear they will not have enough for the future. The legislation reflects the confidence of our modern State.Again I point out the marvellous achievement of this State in the physical life expectancy area. We are close to the average life expectancy that highly developed northern European states have had for 20 or 30 years. This is a great testimony to the people, to those from the Fine Gael and Michael Collins tradition, the Éamon de Valera, James Connolly and great republican and Nationalist traditions which have existed across the benches of this House. I am not so arrogant as to believe that one party, namely, my own, or the other one that claims to be republican, Sinn Féin, have some sort of monopoly on the republican ethos, instinct and outlook of the State. Many parties have that instinct, including Fine Gael.It is a great testimony to our collective effort as parties, and the parties from which we originated in the foundation and forging of our independence, that we have now reached a stage where life expectancy has been greatly extended. That is a fantastic achievement. This achievement may bring a negative impact in terms of the need to fund pensions for the future. We will have a higher bill. If one took a mean-minded approach, one would say the State would be better off if we all died 15 years earlier, or 20 years earlier in the case of women.These figures are a sign of confidence in the State. We are now achieving the averages and figures achieved by the successful states of Europe in all areas, such as life expectancy, nutrition, levels of poverty, and this is a tribute to everyone. While we often jealously and selfishly say that Fianna Fáil delivered the success, we must be fair. We must be fair to William T. Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald and the great people who were not of our political stripe who have contributed to the success of this State.

I enjoyed listening to Deputy Lenihan's contribution. Perhaps he hoped to flatter me into submission so that I would not respond to him, but I will not take the bait.It was hilarious to listen to him discuss what he described as a Fine Gael reversal of policy. He then stated that we could not just spend, spend, spend and live for the moment. That is a reversal of the policy adopted by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in the lead-up to 2002.

It is a minor attempt at responding to the work of the commission on public service pensions. Will the Minister indicate the reason for this being one of the few commission recommendations he is implementing at this stage?I accept what previous speakers said about population trends and that we have to respond to them. There has been an increase in life expectancy and a decline in birth rates which effectively means there will be more people of pension age in years to come and probably fewer people for them to depend upon. However, these predictions are not an exact science and population trends, growth and decline can change for various reasons. I accept that we must plan for the future and make decisions now to ensure we can adequately deal with the situation. I regret that the Minister has taken such a short-sighted approach by only addressing certain aspects of the commission's report.I agree that there should be no compulsion for people to retire at a certain age if they are fit and willing to remain in employment. That makes sense. I will return to the issue of fitness. Deputy Lenihan responded to a point from Deputy Healy on the issue of willingness to retire, which is considerably negated when one considers that 65 is the minimum age for receipt of a pension. Needs must, springs to mind in this context. In effect, people will have to stay in employment until the age of 65 as they will not have a choice without access to a pension. While there is no legislative compulsion, in effect, people are obliged to do so.The Tánaiste recently made a statement on care of the elderly. At present, many people who retire early do so to look after elderly parents or relatives. If these people have to remain in the system we will have to find an alternative to the home as a place of care. The potential impact of the pension regulations in this regard has not been considered. If both spouses remain working from necessity, what will happen to their elderly parents or relatives? Such people may be forced into nursing homes, which will be a further cost to the State. I would like to hear the Minister's response to this point.My greatest criticism of the Bill is its lack of flexibility. It is vital the Minister looks at it again to ensure that pension arrangements meet the needs of those concerned. The Bill allows for pension rights to be calculated on the basis of the last three years of a person's employment. Of necessity, this means a person will have to remain at the peak of his or her career in terms of pay, which also implies greater pressure for the last three years of their working lives. It would be preferable to allow people to remain in employment but to take a step back to a less stressful and less demanding job without affecting their pension rights. This would also create promotional opportunities for others and at the same time would allow the workplace to benefit from the experience and qualifications of older members of staff acting in a less demanding capacity. This type of mobility has never been encouraged in the Civil Service, which is both a great pity and a shame.We also need to look at mobility from the perspective of relocating Departments. The decentralisation process may ultimately create this, but from its haphazard handling so far, it will be by accident rather than design. The filling of top-level Civil Service positions and those of middle management in the past five years have been from within the same Department. Only one in five posts have been filled by persons from a different Department. In theory, the competition is open, but the practice appears to be different. This lack of flexibility and mobility means fewer promotional opportunities for those who are ambitious within the service and I fear these limited proposals will only increase the problem.A lack of flexibility and mobility has also been evident in the manner in which the Minister announced this matter. While we have an opportunity to discuss issues in the House, they have been presented to employees involved in a take-it-or-leave-it manner. Had there been real discussion with teachers, for example, we could have ensured the Bill met actual needs and, accordingly, would have been far better. This appears to be a recurrent theme in the education sector as far as the Government is concerned. The take-it-or-leave-it approach adopted in the legislation is matched by the same style being adopted by the Minister for Education and Science. His "Yes" theme might stand for your education system, but his philosophy is clearly, my way or no way. The Minister for Education and Science, in launching the "Yes" campaign said it is important that as many people as possible have a say in the way our education system progresses over the coming years. The type of decisions we make now will have a real impact on the lives and well-being of our children. They should be decisions made with the greatest possible level of public participation. While I agree with him, these pension decisions will have a profound impact on the public service with which there has been little consultation.The changes that are proposed are serious. In broad terms, as I said, the decision to remove the compulsory retirement age, thereby enabling staff to remain longer in work should they so wish, is welcome. There is a growing appreciation of the contribution that people of any age can bring to the teaching profession, and the public service in general. However, if the Government seriously wishes to encourage later retirement, it must realise that as people get older they may want to move to less stressful employment. A pension that is based on final salary may force people to stay in a stressful position for much longer than would otherwise be the case.Teaching is a demanding and stressful job, and cases of teacher burn-out occur. We must consider what practical benefit will accrue to students if teachers who wish to leave the profession, or move to a less stressful or intensive role within it, are forced to teach for an additional ten year period. The INTO stated that at present less than 20% of teachers teach until the compulsory retirement age of 65 and 50% of teachers retire voluntarily between the ages of 55 and 65. These facts strengthen the case I made on the lack of consultation with teaching unions. They contrasted this system to that of a generation ago when teachers could and did seek an extension to their career. Teachers are leaving the classrooms for a number of reasons, which to some extent come under the remit of the Minister for Finance, although the ultimate responsibility rests with the Minister for Education and Science. Class size remains too high, classrooms are insufficiently resourced and buildings are in a poor state. Perhaps the most important issue is behavioural and emotional problems among students and a lack of support for teachers in dealing with this.I referred to the issue of fitness for the job, which goes to the heart of the matter. Forcing people to remain in the system when they wish to leave could have serious negative consequences for the provision of education. How does the Minister intend to ensure or quantify the issue of fitness? If he intends to proceed on this basis, he should respond to the concerns that have been expressed, which the Bill fails to answer. If the issue of fitness is not addressed, students will suffer as a result. This is not a situation with which teachers, parents or students should be faced in the future.Deputy Andrews offered what he considered to be a way out. Under section 10, teachers suffering from stress can retire on the grounds of ill health. There is no definition of ill health in the definitions section of the Bill. I do not see this as an appropriate way out. Practically everyone suffers from stress at some stage. Reactions to stress vary — what is tolerable to one person could have a serious effect on another. What will be the burden of proof on grounds of ill health? This is an inadequate response to the problem.Greater flexibility in retirement age could act as an incentive to those who wish to enter the teaching profession at a later stage in their lives, which would be welcome. There are many who could make a very positive contribution to the classroom who are in other professions. Greater latitude regarding retirement may incentivise those entering the system. It is important to note, however, that this type of flexibility could also be used to allow teachers to move to different positions, should they wish to do so, without losing pension entitlements when they reach retirement age.Fine Gael believes that greater flexibility needs to be incorporated into the system so that pension calculations will not simply be based upon final-year earnings but will take account of the highest salary scale achieved in the course of a teaching career.I know the provisions of this Bill relate to new entrants to the public service on or after 1 April 2004. The Minister seems to be treating different sectors at entry level differently. I accept that, when one embarks on a teacher training course at whatever age, one does not become a public servant until such time as one engages in a teaching job. However, students embark on their courses in the legitimate expectation that they will get a teaching job. This is a legitimate expectation given that the number of unqualified teachers in the primary sector is such that everybody graduating from a teacher training college is more or less guaranteed a teaching job. However, graduates of teacher training colleges now discover they are caught by the new rules governing entrance to the public service from 1 April 2004.This is a different system to that which applies to trainee gardaí. I accept that such trainees are on the payroll from the time they enter Templemore, but they are not qualified. Section 2(4)(c) provides a clear exemption for “a person who immediately before 1 April 2004 stood admitted as a trainee Garda to the Garda College at Templemore”. The Minister should, at the very least, apply this exemption to existing students in teacher training colleges.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. I note that the Minister said in his contribution that the Bill offers a win-win outcome when viewed in its entirety. Furthermore, he stated that, not only makes a major contribution towards fiscal soundness, it is also a vital component in making it possible for the State, as a good employer, to provide a reasonable income for its employees at retirement. This is an important point because I can think of many who have not been able to get State jobs and who would be glad to have the security they offer, such as those in Monaghan Poultry Products and the furniture industry in Monaghan. It is important that we guarantee such security.I am concerned about a number of aspects of the Bill, one of which pertains to the Garda and Defence Forces. We are now saying that public service workers should work longer. I do not fully disagree with this but a garda, for instance, cannot join the force after the age of 26. Will the Minister reconsider this? I have come across several young people who are older than 26 who wanted to join the Garda. I have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider this seriously. If we extend the age at the upper end we should also extend it at the lower end to allow people over the age of 26 to join. We have a problem in this area. The figures show clearly that gardaí are trying to leave the force because they joined too young. They have known no other life and are frustrated. If we are to encourage them to stay in the force until retirement age, we should certainly address this problem.Deputy Enright dealt with the problems of teachers and I also want to address these. The INTO and others have made representation to us regarding the problems in this sector. Education has been the bedrock of our success. Some experts say otherwise but anyone who believes otherwise is stupid. The good education structures that were put in place in the middle of the previous century have paid off in the longer term and certainly have been of benefit. There should be a common-sense approach. There is burnout in the teaching profession at present and it is unfair that a teacher can only find a way out by using a doctor's certificate to claim or prove he or she is sick. This means such teachers cannot, in the later years of their lives, enter another type of employment that might be good not only for them but for the State. The teachers' unions are disappointed that there was not better discussion on this topic before the Bill was introduced, bearing in mind Deputy Conor Lenihan's statement that negotiations in the partnership process are rubber-stamped in the House.The issue of voluntary retirement is also important and provision should be made so that those who want to retire early can do so. We must prepare for the greater numbers that will be drawing pensions in the future. Are the Minister's figures really correct?

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The plan to have medical cards for the over-70s was discussed in the House and we were told it would require more than €19 million to implement. A year later we learned that it took €53 million to implement. We were told it would cost €20 million to implement the plan to grant pensions to those who made social welfare contributions prior to 1953, but this turned out to be €100 million. Obviously, the figures pertaining to future pension costs are very much up in the air and depend on many factors. According to a previous Minister's statement, we exported 47,000 of our best young people in 1987. This changed the demographics of the country dramatically and we hope it will never happen again.The main issue I want to discuss is that of people being encouraged to work until they reach a later retirement age. Deputy Enright has already commented on careers. If everybody, including both husband and wife, must work to 65 years of age, who will look after the elderly? As a member of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I have discussed this area at length. It is one of the sectors that has been left behind in no uncertain terms by the so-called Celtic tiger. We can all say that carers received a certain sum more in 2004 than in 1997, but we know the reality is that elderly people cannot get into nursing homes because there are no subventions available for them. Prior to the general election, 264 subventions were available in the Cavan-Monaghan area, and this figure decreased to 156 last year. The figure increased to more than 200 this year because of outrage in the area.If people must work to a greater age without the possibly of retirement, there is no doubt that problems will arise. According to Deputy Conor Lenihan, women are living 20 years longer on average than they did at the foundation of the State, and men are living 15 years longer on average. If we do away with certain pension entitlements for the elderly, we will have to sustain the elderly by other means. This must be considered seriously.The Bill states that there should be no compulsion in the system for people to retire at a certain age if they are fit and willing to remain in employment.. The retirement age for new entrants to the Garda is 55, and 65 for teachers. Can the Minister honestly say to us that the provisions in the legislation will benefit those who need care in the longer term?Given that I, as one approaching 60 years of age, am already a Member of the House, the provisions in the Bill will not make any difference to me. However, regardless of what the other speakers stated about the need for the same rules to apply to Members as everybody else, Members are in a different set of circumstances. The average tenure for a Dáil Deputy is approximately 11 years. That may suit someone who comes in at the age of 25 because he or she then has the opportunity to take up another job afterwards. That needs to be considered. The Minister has introduced a very harsh rule that may have implications for people who want to enter this House for the long term. I urge him to look again at that. We depend on the public to decide whether we get a job. Other civil servants are employed and unless they do something that results in being sacked, they have a job for life so their situation is somewhat different to ours, regardless of what people say. I would like the Minister to consider that before it is too late.

The Taoiseach said he would need to be mad to continue doing his job when he is in his 60s. He may have been referring to running around Amiens Street, or one of the many other beautiful streets of Dublin Central, on a Saturday morning with a cohort of Fianna Fáil members in tow. Nonetheless, it is interesting that he saw himself doing something different in his 60s and that the minimum retirement age would not refer to him. In the Oireachtas section of this Bill, future taoisigh are excluded under the new entrant rule. The Taoiseach's remark was a double hypocrisy.It is almost four years since the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and six years since the national pensions policy initiative securing retirement income was presented to this House. The Minister had the opportunity yesterday, and a few months ago, to bring forward a comprehensive programme of public service pension reform rather than take a minimalist approach. It is remarkable that he introduced this Bill while we still await implementation of many of the key recommendations of that report. When will the Minister bring them forward? He seems to think only in fiscal terms. He went out of his way yesterday to explain that he did not have an agreed approach from the social partners to bring this legislation before us and to make his announcement in the budget. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said the same in the Seanad some weeks ago. The Minister acted in his typically unilateral way.The Bill is a direct attack on the rights of future public servants in many of the key categories. In the general range of civil servants, nurses, local government staff and others, one might have given more than 40 years service and not receive a pension until age 65. That is a downgrading of conditions. The rule whereby teachers could retire after 35 years at the age of 55 is going and there is a ten year increase to retirement at 65 years of age. This takes no account of the stresses involved in teaching. All members of the public service experience stress, including those who are here today. There are unique stresses in first and second level education. The latter is on the verge of revolutionary changes because of ICT developments and major retraining will be necessary yet the Minister has not provided for that.It is good that gardaí can continue to work longer given the number who have taken early retirement, resulting in a loss to the public service of many fine officers. I have some concerns about the change in their terms and those of prison officers and psychiatric nurses who also must wait another ten years for retirement. The same is true of the permanent defence forces, where the 21 year rule has been scrapped in favour of 50 years. The commission report did not cover Senators, Deputies and the judiciary but the Minister has chosen to include them here which is fair, in so far as we are all public servants and should be considered together. The minimum retirement age has increased by 15 years to 65.Section 3 is very welcome, covering the removal of compulsory retirement where a new entrant shall not be obliged to retire on health grounds. That provision is the key element in ongoing equality legislation and at the end of 2006 a major EU directive will become operational which I hope will eliminate all ageism across the workforce. There are operational categories in this Bill requiring certain levels of fitness but in general it seems the disgraceful ageist discriminations, based on the belief that people would die in their mid-50s or early 60s, are being abandoned. People have much to contribute in their 60s, 70s and 80s. It is interesting that the flag bearer for the Democrats in the United States, Senator Kerry, is 60 years of age while his last opponent for the presidential nomination was probably considered very inexperienced and too young because he was only 50. We are moving into a fairer era and I welcome the Minister's recognition of that in this Bill.The brave new dawn on 29 March sponsored by his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, when the ban on smoking in the workplace takes effect, and other developments on obesity education and so on will, I hope, give us a fitter, older cohort. In years to come we may have a Taoiseach well into his 60s, maybe even this Minister, like Albert Reynolds in the past. Should we not therefore consider, in line with the commission report, a more innovative and flexible approach for senior and other public servants who would have pension entitlements but wish to continue working? The report recommends flexibility across all levels of pensions for the public service.David McWilliams, the fine economist and TV presenter, said recently that the Minister has allowed a conspiracy against people in their 20s and early 30s to happen in the housing market. That conspiracy continues against our children, who will one day be our public servants and representatives. When the Labour Party last had some influence in France under Mr. Jospin, there was a Minister for Solidarity Between Generations, which was a good name for a Department. This Minister has displayed a contrary tendency. There is no solidarity. He is saying let the devil take the hindmost and let that young crowd who will be very fit later on work as long as possible before they earn their public sector pension.The two Ministers who have conducted this Bill through the Dáil and Seanad, Deputies McCreevy and Brian Lenihan, trotted out the old rigmarole, probably written by the mandarins in the Department of Finance about the pensions time bomb instead of celebrating longevity and that older workers could contribute so much. The bottom line of their mantra seems to be the increasing cost to the taxpayer in 2050, as if we can worry that much about posterity. The old numbers in the commission report were trotted out repeatedly indicating we would have one worker for every pensioner in 2056. I predict that in 2056 it can be taken for granted that there will not be one worker for every pensioner. Society will be considerably different. There will probably be flexibility among workers and pensioners and much older people still working.The Department of Finance is notorious for its poor predictions. Every year coming up to budget time everything seems to be going haywire and then suddenly a windfall tax seems to slide in and everything is hunky-dory. The Department did not predict the Celtic tiger or the current levels of immigration. A few weeks ago I asked the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, what would happen to the labour market after 1 May. She has not got the slightest clue. I do not believe it will be the same as when Portugal and Spain joined.I am not sure if the Minister for Finance attended the recent Progressive Democrats conference on ageing, where he would have found many congenial speakers. No speaker addressed the massive tax breaks for private pension schemes for property owners, who bought 40% of our houses constructed last year to create a nice pension for themselves in the decades ahead.I give the Minister credit for the fact that Ireland is very well prepared for future demographic development. When debating the Pensions (Amendment) Bill with then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in advance of the 2002 general election, I was struck by how relatively well prepared Ireland was with occupational pension schemes and through the national pensions reserve fund, which was an initiative of the Minister for Finance. At the time one of the tables produced by the Generali Group showed Ireland having the most favourable unfunded pension liabilities of about 120% of GDP. In the UK it was about 150% and in the Netherlands it was about 300%. The figure for Italy was a disastrous 400% with Finland and Sweden nearly as bad. Sweden has taken our example in certain respects and made changes.The opposite of what the Minister claimed in his speech is true. The future is fairly well provided for with the National Pensions Reserve Fund. How big is it now?

The debate needed here is totally different to the one carried out by Chancellor Schröder in Germany. There was uproar when he wanted to cut deferred benefit from approximately 75% to 68% of a worker's final pay, compared with 50% here. As we are well prepared, we should take a measured view of future pension provision and should not react in a niggardly way as the Minister has done.The basis of the Bill is the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. Three of the distinguished members, Senator Joe O'Toole, Ms Rosheen Callender and Mr. Dan Murphy of the trade union movement, praised the wide-ranging reform aspects of the report, including the retention of defined benefit, plans for integration, the extension of coverage to atypical workers and above all the exciting idea of the new SPEARS allowing public servants to contribute to a higher final income. However, they had grave reservations about the Minister setting the minimum retirement age so high. The Minister did not give incentives to public sector staff to encourage them to work to a greater age if they are fitter, as I hope will be the case for workers in the future. It is nonsense that service over 40 years is not recognised and yet the Minister has this provision in the Bill.Section 4 addresses circumstances specific to gardaí. It is notable that student gardaí, who effectively have a contract signed, at that stage are exempted from the new entrant rule and are included with existing members of the force. While this seems to be a fair arrangement, it is shameful that it does not apply to other trainee public servants in particular student teachers.There is a problem with the 26-week provision in section 2(4)(b). Those public servants who were encouraged in the past to seek wider experience in different schemes, including career breaks etc., and who were out of the service for more than six months are not given the opportunity to re-enter after 1 April. This should be extended to September. Some people with many years of public service have left the service. The INTO suggested that 15 years’ prior service should be sufficient for a former public servant to be exempted from the new entrant rule.In several categories the pensionable age has increased by ten years and in the case of new Members of the Oireachtas by 15 years. Exceptions have been made for operational grades like gardaí and members of the Defence Forces. The Minister should also consider other groups with sympathy. I received representations from the Prison Officers Association. In recent times prison officers have provided a relatively easy target for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who has failed to deal with some of the key prison issues. As happened with taxi drivers in the past, the Minister has picked a fairly easy target for reform rather than dealing with his own profession. It will probably be increasingly difficult to get people to consider a career in the public service in the future and this Bill is a further disincentive.The Bill, as presented, is not a wide-ranging Bill based on the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, but a narrow and, in the minds of the Minister's chief advisers, cost-based approach built on the nonsense of looking 50 years ahead. It therefore becomes a relatively straightforward attack on the public service. I would like the Minister to examine the issues I and my colleagues have raised regarding the inequity of some of its provisions.I would also like the Minister to have a broader look at the actuarial position that may develop over the coming decades, given the dramatic changes that have taken place over the past seven years in particular, and the fact that the labour force is much larger than we thought it would be and may continue to grow in the years to come. The glib assumptions that people made in the mid-1980s, and which they are still inclined to make, are no longer true. The Minister should return to the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and examine some of the key and interesting proposals. If we want to encourage people to serve our nation and our communities, there are many good ideas in it. It is the Minister who has responsibility. I hope that in the coming months he will re-examine the issue and consider including some of the suggested amendments.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Pensions affect us all, especially people employed in the public service.Yesterday my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, described the legislation as a step backwards for workers in the public sector. It is one of many steps backwards that public sector workers have been forced to take over the lifetime of the Government. Public sector workers are increasingly undervalued by this Administration which believes that merit exists only in the private sector, that the solution to every problem resides in the free market and that public sector workers are lazy and inefficient.The legislation before us is being characterised as a noble and courageous effort by the Government to deal with an imaginary pensions time bomb. Someone described it as a children's horror story with some evidence to back it up and a great deal to contradict it.I speak as the spokesperson on education for Sinn Féin. I wish to concentrate on the concerns of the Irish National Teachers Organisation to which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, attempted to respond in a letter sent to all Deputies some time ago. Part of the reason teachers have been so much to the fore in arguing against the proposed changes lies in the early history of this State. Shortly after partition, a nearly bankrupt Government forcibly raided the primary teachers' pension fund and replaced it with the present system. As a result, teachers lost control of their own pension fund, something that has now created major difficulties for them.Since that time, the job of teaching has changed out of all recognition in this State, largely for the better. We have seen increased numbers of resource teachers, more accountability, and efforts to cater for students with special needs. While not enough is being done, positive steps have been taken and they should be recognised. Teachers have been at the core of delivering these changes and implementing them on the ground, often in shocking working conditions with limited resources. Demands and pressures have increased at a much faster rate than pay and supports. Teachers have also been asked to make changes to their own work schedules.Primary teaching is an intensive and demanding profession. It is arguable that few professions are more important. The divisions in our education system manifest themselves at an early age. Quality primary school teachers delivering lessons in a progressive and interesting fashion can have a life-changing effect on young people in their care. Students will, in many cases, base their perception of the education system and teachers in general on their experience in primary school. This can make the difference in preventing the alienation of students from the education system.All of this, however, means rising levels of stress on members of the teaching profession, especially teachers working in disadvantaged areas. The Bill's provisions do not take into account the role many teachers play in providing after-school activities. I am sure most Deputies' first exposure to a range of activities took place in schools where teachers gave their own time to coach young people in football, hurling, debating or dancing, and help to create not only academically gifted but well-rounded individuals who would go on to become well-rounded citizens.We welcome the Minister's decision to allow teachers and other professionals to work past the age of 65 should they wish to do so. I have no doubt many of the dedicated men and women working in the teaching sector will avail of this opportunity. We must also recognise that a great many are unable or unwilling to continue to the age of 65. Currently teachers can retire at the age of 55 with reduced benefits. According to the INTO, about one in five teachers avail of this opportunity. These figures do not indicate a savage financial burden on the State. It is much less than that created by many of the tax breaks, the cost of which has yet to be estimated.Why has the Minister singled out teachers? Future gardaí, prison officers and firefighters have seen their minimum pension age increased by five years. For teachers it is another ten. Trainees in each of these three professions are exempt, but student teachers will be discriminated against. This is unjust. To single out certain vital public sector professions to be treated in a discriminatory fashion without providing a real reason for change is an outrage.Having met the INTO, I remind the Minister once again that, as he is well aware, teachers and their representatives are willing to engage in talks and further negotiation, even at this late stage. It appears that it is the Minister who refuses to engage directly and instead engages in dialogue through the media. It is becoming increasingly clear that, far from being the elected servants of the people, when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are elected to power, they consider themselves the masters of the people and are happy to run the country on a whim or a hunch, whether it is the farce of electronic voting, the decentralisation fiasco, the decision to break up Aer Rianta or discrimination in pensions. The Government clearly appears to be drunk with power.The Minister's decision, taken without agreement with the unions concerned, not only the INTO, exposes the charade that is social partnership. It is a one-way street with concessions and deals hammered out to which the unions must adhere but which can be and often are ignored by the Government when it suits. Instead, we typically have unilateral announcements from Ministers, like the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who seem to believe themselves blessed with some sort of papal infallibility, unable to say or do anything wrong. This Minister seems convinced that there is no need to compromise or consult anyone. I believe there is. The Minister seems to believe he is free to disregard the social partners whenever he sees fit to do so. Is this his notion of partnership? If it is, it is a sham. I do not believe it is the right signal to send, especially to people working in the public service. Neither does it encourage unions outside the partnership process. This type of lack of negotiation and riding roughshod over workers' rights sends all the wrong messages to those outside the partnership process.Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to the situation of student teachers. Another group of students will suffer from this change. We received a letter from a student psychiatric nurse at the school of nursing in St. Ita's Psychiatric Hospital, Portrane. Students from Dublin, Meath, Clare, Kerry and other counties, including Kildare, which the Minister represents, wrote to protest against the changes. When they entered the programme they did so in the belief that the rights enjoyed by other nurses would be available to them. The letter in question states:It is my understanding that this proposal will only affect those currently entering employment. We see our employment with this country's various health boards to have begun 3 years ago, when we entered the training programme, and gave a commitment to practice in our chosen profession. We certainly believe that the many patients we have cared for over the years would agree with us.Much like teachers, these nurses have been involved in their professions during their training. They have taken care of patients, seen to their medical and personal needs and treated them with the care and dignity that the high standards of their profession demand.Government Members have highlighted the fact that annual savings in the order of €300 million will be made. Will the Minister to clarify exactly how much he expects to save as a result of the changes to the rights of teachers in respect of pensions and indicate the savings he expects to make as a result of those changes that will affect the current crop of students in the nursing and teaching professions? People need to have that information in order that they can make a decision in respect of this area.I take this opportunity to discuss another pension issue to which the Bill may not specifically refer but which is an important aspect of the entire matter of pensions. It was the law in this State for some time that if a female member of the Civil Service got married, she was legally obliged to give up her job. This meant forfeiting pension rights for which the women concerned were never compensated and their entitlements were never clarified. In a recent document, Pensions for Women, the National Women's Council of Ireland included a case study of a woman who joined the Civil Service in the 1960s. When she got married she was forced to leave her job due to the marriage ban. Having brought up her family, she returned to part-time work in the 1980s. She does not have a pension from work and she does not have a State contributory pension because, through no fault of her own, she was not working outside the home for long enough. There are many such cases.In 2002 only 25% of women over the age of 65 received a State pension based on their own PRSI contributions. Restrictions such as the marriage bar placed many women in situations where they were prevented from earning pensions. This means many of them are faced with the prospect of living in poverty in their old age. Will the Minister clarify what, if anything, the Government intends to do in respect of this matter? What measures does he propose to introduce in the near future? There are many women who are approaching retirement age and who do not have sufficient stamps to claim a contributory pension. This is through no fault of their own but through that of the Government laying down silly and outdated laws.My final point is that the Government thinks it can get away with anything and, regrettably, this seems to be the case. It can force people to rerun referendums when it does not like the result, it can ignore the wishes of the Irish people and support the invasion of Iraq and it can introduce electronic voting in the face of mounting academic evidence opposed to it. The electronic voting system used in the "Super Tuesday" presidential primary this week in the United States disenfranchised 6 million Californian voters. With row after row of compliant Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats backbenchers ready and willing to walk through the lobbies no matter what the issue, the Government's in-built majority will not be threatened by outbreaks of principle among its members.If public sector workers want to defeat this legislation and put manners on the Government, they will, perhaps, see fit to take industrial action. I do not believe anyone wants that to happen. The Government simply does not listen, does not care and, in many instances, does not want to engage in negotiation. I hope public servants are not forced to take that step because it will be the general public, as well as the Government, that will suffer.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. The issue of pensions has become extremely topical and it is appropriate that we should have a debate on it in the House because, in one form or another, we are all affected by it. This will be the first of a number of discussions of pensions in the coming years. If those discussions do not take place while the Minister holds office, they will certainly occur during the terms of office of his successors.The recent "Prime Time" programme on Irish workers who went to England in the 1950s and 1960s really brought this matter home to people. The individuals in question were left without pension rights because they were vulnerable to unscrupulous employers who did not make any arrangements for them. On could draw parallels with people in various occupations here who feel they are vulnerable. Public servants have more security but there are many in the private sector for whom very little provision has been made. People are more interested in houses and cars and are not making plans for their future. However, there is a growing realisation that they must make provision for the future.People are thinking more about their retirement, probably as a result of the country becoming more prosperous and the fact that they have more money. They have less time to think about the ordinary, mundane things of everyday life but they are certainly focusing more on issues such as housing and nursing home provision. They must also consider pension provision which will be very important in the future.If we live long enough, most of us will probably end up in nursing homes. When they consider the costs involved in paying for a bed or a room in a nursing home at present and the fact that subvention cannot cover such costs, people realise that their savings and pensions are so important. If a person is not adequately covered, he or she faces a depressing time later in life. No one wants that to happen.The Minister has addressed this issue and he has referred to it on numerous occasions in the House. We may not agree totally with what he has to say but he has certainly kept it to the fore. The previous Government also sought to address this issue.The level of prosperity in Ireland in the past 12 years since the economy took off has been based on stress, strain and hard work. There are many people in the private sector who have invested a great deal of work and energy into making their own companies successful and, despite what the critics might say, their counterparts in the public sector have ensured that the public service is more efficient. When I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, people worked late into the night preparing documents and policy statements for Europe and to set up schemes. These people are the unsung heroes of the Celtic tiger economy and not enough recognition has been given to them. Many of them are stressed out.They are people whose health has been affected by that level of commitment, by long hours of work and by staying up late into the night. This burn-out, of which we hear so much, will only begin to manifest itself in the years ahead. In professions like teaching, but also right across the public service, that symptom is appearing where it did not previously.All facets of life have got much faster and we must work faster now. Technology has brought great changes. It has speeded up life and has put pressure on all of us. Required response time is much quicker. At one time a letter might take a week to arrive and one had two weeks to respond to it. With e-mail, one must respond immediately or otherwise one is not deemed efficient.The nature of life has changed totally. People in the public service and in the private sector are faced with new challenges. The shape of work has changed so much and expectations are much higher. In the future if we are to remain competitive with the Chinese, the Indians or the eastern Europeans, now that they are coming into the market, we must sustain the current level of work and there will be more burn-out and more casualties.That is why people are increasingly looking at their future. Whereas some will see that they can work longer and live longer, there will be people who will get out earlier because of the nature of work and the mental and physical stresses on the body, to which people are not used and which they cannot take. People do not appreciate that at present. No doubt studies will be done in the years ahead which will look at this Celtic tiger period and how people coped. We are probably sitting on a medical time bomb and this emphasises the importance of the pensions provision in this country.I listened with interest to Deputy Conor Lenihan. He is a man of extraordinary contradictions and I have listened to him over the years. Obviously he is preparing for the reshuffle in July. There was a time when Deputy Lenihan would come in here and have a lash off the Government if it suited him, or go to the plinth, but now he is totally different. He is totally changed. He has become a great spokesman for the Government. He is well able, in all fairness to him, because of his background in journalism, to argue his side of it but he would be just as good five minutes later in the bar arguing the other side.The Deputy spoke about partnership, but of course he ignored the fact that the pensions commission was set up by Deputy John Bruton, although he did mention Deputy Bruton, one of the greatest leaders this country ever produced.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	As the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, once said, he would love to be Taoiseach but he would hate to be leader of Fianna Fáil.There was a commission report and there was the implementation group, and it was in this context that I wanted to make this point. Deputy Lenihan stated that this side of the House was not in agreement with partnership and so forth. Despite the fact that we set up the commission and operated partnership effectively, Deputy Bruton raised some questions at that time which were not fully considered. It is like any new departure. Partnership certainly saved this country. In one of the first contributions I made when I came into this House I stated that it was time all the organisations should come together, that the unions, farmers and Government should come together and hammer out a way forward for the country, otherwise we would not enjoy prosperity — I remember former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, on the change of Government in 1987, saying that while standing here. If one looks back on the record, that is exactly what he said.It was difficult to bring in any partnership arrangement before that because there were politics and games being played at all times like, for example, the time the INTO was totally manipulated in the mid-1980s to march against the Government, and the other teachers' union objected when there was no money to pay anyone. Whereas there was manipulation, partnership got the support of all political parties when it was introduced in the late 1980s because there was no other option for the country.In this instance, the commission report was published and an implementation group was set up. As far as I can understand it, the possibility of raising the age of retirement to between 62 and 65 was under discussion at that time by the partners. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, stood up here in the Dáil on the budget and said it would be 65. Surely that was not the best way of using partnership? Since the age of 65 is so contentious, especially among my colleagues in the teaching profession, why will the Minister not go back to the implementation group before we proceed with this Bill, ask it to look at it again and see if it can reduce the age or give the option of between 62 and 65 years? Perhaps that is a good way to go forward.I acknowledge that some people will not be happy irrespective of what the Minister does, but there is a case for taking on board my suggestion because of the strong case made by the INTO in particular. We have received the INTO's literature which outlined the reasons for its views on the minimum age. I agree with it because I live with a teacher and I know that teaching is very difficult. I was a teacher for eight years when I had plenty of energy, and I certainly enjoyed the job. From the contact I have with teachers, I know the job is totally changing. It has become a very stressful life. A teacher is at the coalface for what some people may think is a short period, but he or she is in a very tight situation. One cannot take a break because one is with children and one has major responsibilities. One is both trying to keep control and teach young people. Due to the change of lifestyles and the breakdown of the family structure, one often has to deal with young children who are different from those of ten or 20 years ago, and it is far more difficult. One needs to be a sociologist or a psychologist. One needs to have endurance. Nowadays to be a teacher one needs so many different attributes which people who are not in teaching do not fully understand.The INTO has highlighted and exposed this in its campaign on this provision. As the Minister will be aware, teachers have been hit harder than other public servants in the sense that their minimum has risen from 55 to 65 years. For other public servants, where 60 years was the minimum age, the move is to 65. In the case of the gardaí, the move is to 60. Therefore teachers have lost out most in this change. In the interests of harmony in the future and of partnership, to which my friend, Deputy Lenihan, referred so much this morning, perhaps in this instance the Minister will go back and review this through the partnership arrangement. Then people would be happy.I welcome this debate. People are becoming far more concerned about provision for their pensions. More information should be available to the public about private pension schemes and so forth. People should consider these more now than previously as it is in their interest to do so. I appeal to the Minister for Finance to consider my request of him to go back to the implementation group on the issue of the minimum age for teaching.Recently, when addressing young people on future careers, I asked if anyone wanted to be a teacher. Nobody did. For my generation at secondary school, teaching was always considered an option.

When I pressed them, they felt there was no great career path in the profession. Only 10% of entrants in teaching are males. It is alarming because there will be an imbalance. Young entrants in teaching would not be that aware of pensions. However, the provision that one could retire at 55 years was a major incentive for people to enter the profession and something the Minister might reconsider in his proposals.I agree with people continuing to work later in life. People should be allowed to continue working until they are 80 provided they make a contribution and are in good health. In this debate, there is confusion between the minimum and the maximum ages for retirement and whether people should be allowed to continue working after the retirement age. I see people retiring who have considerable energy and could still make a contribution to their office, be it in the public or private sector. That they have to retire at a certain age is wrong. The option should be open to people if they wish to carry on. One of the few professions in which one can carry on indefinitely is politics, as the Acting Chairman is aware. Some issues were raised in this good debate that I hope the Minister for Finance will address.

He is universally recognised as one of the great Ministers for Finance in this State's history. How he has steered the success of the economy over the past seven years is the envy of his counterparts in Europe and throughout the world. His foresight in identifying the pensions time bomb must also be praised. The provisions he put in place to respond to it four years ago when he introduced the national pensions reserve fund is an indication of his understanding of future problems.This problem was only last week identified by the great US financial guru, Mr. Alan Greenspan. His medicine for tackling the pensions issue is to cut social security. That is a draconian and severe attack on the very system that supports people in their retirement.. Cutting social security is a drastic measure and, while I do not want to contribute on US financial philosophy, it is obscene that, on the one hand, there are tax cuts for the wealthy and, on the other, Mr. Greenspan proposes cuts in social security for the ordinary person. In Ireland, the Minister for Finance has put in place the national pensions reserve fund that will address this considerable drawdown on the Exchequer in 25 years time.The Bill tackles another problem that will hit this State in 20 years' time. Few countries in Europe have addressed the problem of the declining workforce, which is foolish. We are lucky that the problem has been identified by the Minister for Finance and the necessary legislation and measures to address it are being introduced. There is a back-up fund for the pensions problems. In this Bill, there is an opportunity to move the goalposts, but in a way that does not interfere with those already in public service. All public servants, irrespective of grade, are satisfied that the Minister has not interfered and does not intend to interfere with their employment conditions, as this Bill provides for future entrants.When I was a public servant with the Dublin health authority many years ago, I recall meeting a 65 year old gentleman who was very upset-——

He decried that a young man of 65 years was put out of his work. I was in my early 20s then and I thought it was time for him to retire. However, I now see the logic in allowing those who have their health and are in a position to contribute positively to the public service to continue working after 65. Many of them have a major contribution to make. There are aspects of lifestyle that affect health, but medicine has progressed and people's opportunity for good health into their 70s and 80s has increased. Many of those should be allowed to continue contributing to their jobs or another one into further years than they have the opportunity to do now.Throughout Europe, the issue of raising the retirement age is being discussed. Some countries have adopted a different approach to the Government and have interfered with the existing provisions for public and civil servants. This has brought protest onto the streets of many of the capitals of Europe because of the way this problem is being dealt with in those countries. In the Bill we are discussing, no such proposal is made. Protection is given to existing civil servants. I might add that the decision of the Government and the Minister for Finance late in 2003 to implement the benchmarking report and pay our public servants under the benchmarking provision has brought industrial peace in our public and Civil Service. The same cannot be said for many other states around Europe.At that time, certain politicians questioned whether benchmarking should be paid to our public servants. Indeed, many of our public servants remember the comments that were made at that time. I have no doubt they will not forget them when the opportunity arises for them to have their say in the way in which ordinary citizens can, namely, through the ballot box, either at the local and European elections or at the next general election.

To some extent, all of us can identify with certain problems. I do not want to take away from the comments of Deputy Deenihan about some of the stressful positions in the public service. Certainly there are a number of these today. The teaching profession is a difficult one in this country and internationally. Some of my family are involved in this profession and I know this first hand. The duties of a member of the Garda Síochána are also difficult. In fact, it is hard to believe the uniform of the Garda is treated with such disrespect by some people on the streets of our towns and cities. When I was much younger there was always a great respect and understanding for people who wore the uniform. They carried it with dignity and the public respected that. It appears that this, in many instances, is no longer the case.We also know that our prison officers are subjected to assault and abuse. In some cases there have been attacks on their homes and their families. This is a sad state of affairs. We must ensure provision is made for people in these stressful and sometimes dangerous positions. At the moment a provision exists whose phrasing sounds rather innocuous, but it must be kept there. People in these professions have the opportunity, if necessary, to retire early. This is essential.The Bill addresses in a timely fashion the problems we will face in 15 or 20 years. It would be foolish and inappropriate for the Government not to address the pensions time bomb. The Minister and the Government should be complimented on this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I am glad of the opportunity to comment on this legislation. I listened with interest to some of the previous speakers. Like some other Members of the House, I have been around for a while. The first thing I was warned about when I came to the House was what would happen in 2038. I looked up some reference books to find out what this meant. It sounded like doomsday — the curtain would be coming down. I discovered that 2038 was doomsday from the point of view of the ability of the State to pay its pensions. For some unknown reason it has since been postponed. The dates we talk about now are 2056 or 2065. I never accepted that 2038 was a genuine problem and I do not now accept that 2056 is one.What has happened is that the statisticians have completely failed to recognise the age profile of the Irish people. They have failed to recognise that we have inward migration and take account of that in their calculations. They have failed to recognise that the birth rate is increasing and that large numbers of people will be entering the labour force between now and 2038, 2056 or 2065. I do not know when it will happen — I have no intention of staying around all that time.The argument at that time was put forward in the same way as the argument being put forward by the Government now. It was said this was a serious problem and needed to be dealt with, and if we did not deal with it we were not being responsible. Anybody who cast aspersions on the proposals of the Government was a brainless lunatic. The thinking has changed; there is no doubt about that. Nobody who carries the responsibility for the original 2038 proposals came forward and said they were sorry, but it was ten, 20 or 35 years out. I do not accept that part of the argument.People have spent quite an amount of time commenting on partnership and how partnership has done this country proud. There is no doubt this is true — we have benefited from partnership. However, we have also suffered some deficiencies as a result of partnership. There can be no doubt that the area that partnership forgot was that of housing. Housing was completely forgotten throughout the partnership negotiations. There was a second bite of the cherry a couple of years ago when it was realised how serious the problem was and the Government proposed to build 10,000 new houses to meet housing demands. Building 10,000 houses to meet the housing needs of a waiting list of approximately 100,000 families was a peculiar way of trying to solve the problem. In case anybody thinks I am joking, I will point out for the benefit of those on the other side of the House, who are major contributors to partnership, that along with those on the local authority waiting lists, on which there are at least 45,000 families, there are a similar number of people who will never be able to buy a house because of the colossal increase in house prices over the last number of years. In order to achieve a half-chance of buying their own houses, these people must do what the economy does not require — they must seek higher wages and become part of the new vision, the high-wage economy we are hearing about.I question two aspects of the Government's actions. The first is the validity of its argument about what will happen in 2056 or 2065. How has this date moved so dramatically from 2038? The famous economist John Kenneth Galbraith is the only economist I have read of whom it could honestly be said that he was genuinely human and recognised other things apart from economics. He said, and I know it might seem alarming, that the people who had reached retirement age had a role to play, without a doubt, but that it should be a more voluntary role than the one they played previously. He also went into great detail to explain that it may not be possible for them to devote the same amount of time, accept the same levels of stress as when they were in their 20s, 30s or whatever and give economically to the country in the same way as in the past. He went into that in great detail.He then, in his own inimitable fashion, suggested that they should be sent to St. Tropez for vacations and to various other exotic, and some erotic, locations in the course of their retirement in order that they would be brought back into the workforce again refreshed and able to make a worthwhile contribution to the economy. I notice that the Minister of State is very interested by the mention of these aspects. I can see his interest immediately perk up and that he already has visions of palm trees and so on. I urge the Minister of State not to go there. He did not mean it in just that way. He was merely illustrating that to get more benefit from those who are experienced in the workplace and encourage them to continue, they would require some inducements. A pension is one of them.Depending on the degree to which they were catered for it would be possible for them to continue, not in a voluntary capacity, but they would volunteer for work rather than be forced to work. What worries me is that it is a sure sign that there is something odd going on when the Government begins to panic into running off in a particular direction to raise money somewhere down the road. I sincerely hope that this is not part of another election gimmick, some of which we have seen in the not too distant past. The purpose of the exercise could be to save money to ensure that it is possible for the outgoing Government to buy out the people when it comes to an election.I know this has never been considered on the other side of the House and that they would never even spare a thought for such a plan. However, I have genuine and sincere doubts. They have thought of it. They think about it regularly. Since the last general election in 2002 they have thought about it day and night. Their every waking hour is devoted to figuring out a way to pull the next fast one in the next general election. I have no doubt that this is the purpose of this legislation and a number of other legislative measures. All of them are aimed at extracting money from the people by one means or another for a longer period and in greater amounts, with the objective of having the money at the disposal of Government when the crucial time comes.That was done very effectively in the past. I have no hesitation in saying that, and I congratulate the Government. In another three years it will have been in government for 20 years with the exception of two and a half years. It has certainly pulled a few fast ones in that length of time, but I am afraid that the public is not amused anymore.

Shocked he will be, but not too shocked. I want to let the Government members down gently because it would not be fair to have them turfed out of office unceremoniously, which is what the people are going to do. They should be forewarned. We are trying to forewarn them just now.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I will do my best. I sometimes get distracted. This Bill proposes to address a number of issues in the public service. For example, I know that there are exclusions at the moment, but they are only for the moment. Coming from a county that has certain associations with military installations, one of the things we have heard criticism of in the past is that the military can retire at 42 or 43 years of age. I have always supported that notion. It has served this country well. It has ensured that we have an Army that is attractive for people to join.The exclusions being mentioned at the moment are fine, but I warn that it appears it is intended to go down that route and that at some stage it will be impossible for a person coming out of the military with 20 years service or whatever to achieve the same pension rights as they had in the past. I have no doubt that is the objective. When that happens it will be impossible to keep that Army as an attractive profession or calling — it is a particular calling. After all, the military risk their lives. I accept they are paid for it but there is a risk to their lives at all times. That is generally recognised. We should never get away from the fact that whatever means necessary should be found to make recompense for their being there and for their commitment to the security of the State and security overseas. We need to be very careful not to change the system because we may well find ourselves in the position of being unable to attract adequate personnel into the Defence Forces.There are those who think that we should not have an army and that military authorities are obsolete. I warn the Minister of State against that thinking, and I hope it has not pervaded the Department of Finance or any other Department. If it does it will have serious consequences for the security of the State. That has been proven more than once. The same applies to prison officers and the Garda. Most other speakers have referred to the fact that there are a number of exclusions at present. I particularly emphasise that it is far better to have a system that brings about a more regular turnover than to restrict in any way the rights of those who could previously retire at a particular age.I know this does not apply to those who are already employed as members of the various forces. It applies to new entrants, and the definition of new entrants is outlined in great detail in section 2 of the Bill. However, in the event of the average age increasing, in any of the services targeted, as a result of the proposed changes, I am not so certain that will be beneficial either to the particular service or to the economy. I do not accept it.Much has been said about the teaching profession. I know there has been a running battle between the Government and the teaching profession over the past couple of years and that this battle continues. I have no doubt that it will be fought out again at the next election, and we will see what happens. The Government was very successful in deflecting attention away from those sensitive areas in the last general election. I do not know what it will be like in the next one, but that ongoing debate will certainly be revisited.What is the benefit for the country, economy and the people served by public servants if, for example, a teacher who has come to the end of his or her normal working life under current arrangements must, as a result of the proposed changes, work another five years or whatever the case may be? Is it for the benefit of children and the community or for the benefit of the Government? I seriously doubt whether it is a good thing. I agree that there will be teachers who will find it beneficial to work on and who may well have much to offer. However, the question must be asked about any aspect of the public service whether the curtailment of the pension entitlement at a certain age will be beneficial to the public servants themselves? A person who has worked for 30 or 40 years will view it in that light. The Minister of State will reply that this legislation will only apply to new entrants.I note that Deputy Finneran referred to other Governments throughout Europe who are attempting to interfere with the payments that might be due to people in mid-term, as it were, so that their entitlement to pension would be reduced because their original entitlement was pitched at too high a rate. If a Government were elected on the basis of what it proposed to offer the people and then found it was not such a good idea and wanted to offer them less at the halfway point of their working lives, that would a shame on such a Government and on the people if they were to allow such a Government to get away with it.I do not agree that what the Government proposes is for the benefit of the economy. It is for the benefit of Government by ensuring that it stays in power with as much money as possible in the back pocket to be forked out in the six months before or during an election campaign, as happened in the previous general election. It was nothing unusual for Ministers at the time to sashay around the constituencies offering manna in the form of different allocations to various groups and organisations. I will not go into Parlon country out of sensitivity to the situation. It would not be fair to venture there.

Incidentally, it could also have a bearing on the delivery of what was promised previously to public servants, and the Minister of State will know to what I refer.According to the Government on budget day, there was to be a series of local, scenic sites as locations for the public service. Public servants were to be transported or beamed into these sites. I do not understand why, but something went wrong. It was discovered that some Departments, a few hundred of whose staff it was proposed to relocate, only had approximately 120 staff. I know that everything is possible over on the Government side of the House, but I wonder at the situation.In the context of this legislation, to what extent have there been discussions with the wider public service in the course of the debate on relocation, as I term it, or on decentralisation, as the Government terms it?

I am not at all convinced about the Government's objectives in its strategy.

The public will say that Oireachtas Members will welcome the new proposals. It may well happen in four, five or ten years' time that membership of the Oireachtas may not be an attractive option because there will be many other competing options. The young and the not so young may not wish to serve in this House. In the interests of the public and new entrants, the Government will need to keep a close watch to ensure that it is not being penny wise and pound foolish. I wish I had a longer time to speak.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Its main objective is to increase the minimum pension age from 60 to 65 years and abolish the link for new entrants between age and compulsory retirement. I wish to speak on the subject of retirement. Society has decided that a person should retire at a certain age. I firmly believe that people age at different rates. A person of 90 years of age can be as fresh as somebody of 60 years because of the differing rates of ageing. Not alone do people age physically at different levels, they also age differently at a mental level. A person may be mentally and physically active at 65 and in a position to contribute for perhaps five or even ten years to their workplace, community or society. There is a perception that everybody should break down at 65 years. While it has been traditional to retire at 65 for many generations, that should now be examined.There are also people who may age earlier. A person at 60 may be burnt out or may be more physically and mentally aged than someone of 70 or 75 years. I suggest a more flexible approach to ageing.The Bill offers people an opportunity to work beyond the age of 65 and I am in favour of such a proposition. We should allow and facilitate people who can contribute to society and to their workplace and community to work beyond the age of 65. There are examples of marvellous contributions by older statesmen who are well beyond 65 years of age and who have contributed enormously to the political development of their countries. Mr. Nelson Mandela and others have made significant contributions when they were older than 65, not to mention the Chinese leaders who work until they are in their 90s and are in a position to make a contribution.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Much of the emphasis in the discussion on this general Bill seems to be on teaching. Media chat shows talk about teachers' holidays and conditions of employment. Teaching is a pressurised and stressful job. Parents among us will have frequently found it difficult to deal with one, two or three children, not to mention trying to control 25 or 30 children.My definition of a child is the same as the legal definition, that is, a person under 18 years. Teachers are well trained to do their job and the House must compliment the training systems which have served the State so well in the various areas of teaching. Developments in teacher training have been of great value, particularly at second level. The second level teacher training programme in the University of Limerick, for example, takes a holistic approach which involves teaching subjects and developing students' teaching skills, as opposed to the model in which subjects are taught and students then progress to take a higher diploma in education. The course develops the person as a teacher from the moment he or she enters the college to the day students sit their final degree examinations.People have different temperaments. Some will be relaxed when endeavouring to control a class, communicate to students and achieve targets, while others will find this task stressful and pressurised. Given that some teachers burn out at different times, we should be careful to ensure we facilitate those who believe they have reached the end of their teaching career, but may wish to proceed to do something else.Some teachers, aged 55 or 60 years, may be no longer able to handle the stress and pressure of the classroom and, as a result, have lower levels of control and communication and be less capable of imparting knowledge. In such circumstances, students will suffer. For this reason, we require a facility which allows us to recognise this process and ensure that the children involved and their education are always prioritised. If this is best achieved by increasing the age of retirement for teachers, so be it, but when a teacher's performance diminishes as a result of stress and pressure and the education of his or her students is affected, the teacher in question should not be compelled to wait until the age of 65 years before retiring.Some teaching unions have indicated their concerns regarding sections of the Bill. Section 2(4) provides that where a person who was serving in a public service body prior to 31 March 2004 returns to a position after 1 April 2004, he or she will not be categorised as a re-entrant, provided he or she returns not later than 26 weeks following the last day of service prior to 31 March 2004. It has been pointed out to us that while the thrust of this provision, namely, the discounting of breaks of 26 weeks, is welcome, it does not go far enough because it is of no benefit to public servants who have already been out of service for a period of more than six months. In some respects, this provision also applies retrospectively. People who have served in the public service may not be aware of this. Surely a more equitable approach would be to give people currently out of service a six month window of opportunity to return to the service, commencing on 1 April to 2001 and concluding on 1 September 2004. I ask the Minister to consider this proposal before Committee Stage.The position adopted by the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is that public servants currently out of service who return to the service after 1 April next should not be regarded as new entrants if they have previously given lengthy service to the State, because experienced public servants would be dissuaded from returning to the service if the new terms were to be applied to them.In the context of decentralisation, it is in the Minister's interest that public servants with skills, knowledge and experience, who have been out of service for a considerable period, would re-enter the service. Considerable concern has been expressed in the House by Opposition Members and outside it by Government Members to the effect that people with high level skills will not move from Dublin to the towns proposed as locations for decentralised bodies. If the Minister can amend the legislation to make it attractive for people with skills and experience who left the public service for a period to return to assist the decentralisation process, he should do so. Although we support decentralisation, we are concerned about its likelihood of success.Many of the teachers who are currently out of service are women who left the profession temporarily due to family circumstances. The legislation could potentially create problems in the area of equality legislation if such women were to be treated less favourably in terms of pension age than men or others who are not de facto required to leave the public service for family reasons. I have discussed this issue with many career women, notably teachers and politicians, who find it difficult to reconcile their career with their role as mothers.The day we do not recognise the special role of mothers is the day our society will understand less about the nature of humanity. A mother's special role, her special relationship with her children and young children's special need for their mother means that women leave employment to rear their families with much greater frequency than men. While some men successfully assume the role of house husband, we must recognise that women leave employment to rear families in much greater numbers. Some people believe this should change, and perhaps it should to some extent, but we must deal with society as it is, and the facts show that it is generally women who leave teaching to rear families before returning to the profession. The question which will arise in this context is whether the legislation discriminates against such women. I ask the Minister to examine this matter.Much has been said about student teachers. I was contacted as late as last night by students attending the University of Limerick who are concerned about the legislation. Student teachers have a right to justice. The Bill specifically provides that persons admitted to a Garda training college before 1 April will not be regarded as re-entrants though their period of training may extend beyond 1 April 2002. Student teachers of colleges of education are seeking a similar exemption. While it is accepted there is not a direct contractual comparison between trainee gardaí and student teachers, surely there is a special relationship between student teachers and the State.Student teachers embarked on their careers with certain expectations of conditions of employment. The small cohort of people who had such expectations on taking up a career in teaching should have their position recognised. They should receive the same treatment as trainee gardaí. The number of student teachers is determined by the State and currently stands at approximately 3,200. Those numbers relate directly to the State's future teaching needs. The bachelor of education course for primary teachers qualifies a graduate for only one occupation, a teacher in a primary school. This cohort of students has already embarked, at the State's expense, on their careers as teachers and should not be considered new entrants following graduation and subsequent employment in national schools.Further evidence of the special position of student teachers is contained in the rules for national schools. Rule 155 requires that candidates for admission to colleges of education must be assessed by the college medical officer and certified as being of sound and healthy constitution and free from any physical or mental defect likely to impair his or her usefulness as a teacher. A similar medical process is required at the end of the training period. Approximately 1,000 student teachers will graduate from the various colleges in May 2004 having completed three years training. It is grossly unfair to apply the new position to them because their courses will not conclude until May. They will lose out by one month in terms of their expectations of conditions of employment on retirement. These students should not be denied, because of one month, their expectation of a condition of employment on retirement following three years training to become a teacher.I want to draw the Minister's attention to the concerns expressed by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation which has pointed out that, historically, teachers have had the option of retiring from 55 onwards, having completed 35 years service. It is proposed in this Bill to increase the retirement age for teachers from 55 to 65 years. Other categories of the public service have had their minimum pension age increased by only five years. Is it fair to increase by ten years the age at which teachers may retire when the age of retirement for others is being increased by only five years? Surely the same upward adjustments should apply in each case.This is necessary legislation. I will conclude my remarks by returning to where I started. People age at different times of their lives. A person 70 years of age could be mentally and physically as fit as a person of 50 years of age.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	This Public Service Superannuation Bill 2004 is reactionary legislation which proposes to raise the standard minimum age of retirement in the public service to 65 years. This is neo-liberalism in the extreme as far as the Irish Government is concerned.The Tanáiste who is close ideologically to the Minister for Finance — not that there is anything ideological between any member of the Cabinet in reality — stated this morning at the Forum on Europe when referring to services now in the public domain that it did not matter who held ownership of our services. She said ownership was not a matter for concern; it was more important to ensure the services were available. That epitomises the philosophy of the current Government which does not care who has ownership of our services so long as they are taken off its hands. However, ownership is absolutely critical to ordinary people because it will determine the level of access to or restriction of access to services. When ownership passes from the public arena, as is rapidly happening throughout the European Union, the criteria for people accessing those services are pitched at whether they will be able to pay sufficiently to make a killing for the multinational and other corporations and financial interests that move in to purchase the services.Given the Tanáiste's attitude, is it any wonder this type of reactionary legislation which is going backwards in terms of workers' rights, is being brought before the Dáil by the Government? Incredibly, and the Minister says this with a straight face, this legislation is being enacted to save €300 million per annum in 40 years time. The Minister for Finance, in his budget speech in December 2001 slashed corporation taxes to the effect of €329 million in a full year. A year later he gave a further €305 million to major corporations in another tax cut. A total of €634 million in cuts was given to big business. What will be the impact of those cuts in a full year?The Minister for Finance is now seeking to chain public servants to their places of employment until they reach 65 years of age to provide for a saving of €300 million in 40 years. That is incredible. It is extremely reactionary because it is dragging working conditions backward instead of propelling them forward. He should be ensuring we have working conditions better suited to human well-being and human comfort.We have to go back to the 1880s when the industrialised world was convulsed by the struggles of millions of workers to reduce the working day to eight hours, from ten, 12 or 14, such as existed even in the heartland of capitalism, the United States of America. The date of 1 May 1886 was set as the deadline by the Federation of Organised Trades and Labour Unions in the United States by which a powerful movement of working people was to be put behind that demand, and so it happened, with major strike movements and mobilisations of working people which were reacted to viciously by the authorities in the United States. Workers were shot down participating in peaceful protest. Agents provocateurs threw bombs into the crowd to blame it on the organisers, and the Haymarket martyrs, those workers’ leaders, were framed and hanged as a result of that huge struggle. Those struggles reduced the number of hours in a working day to a tolerable limit, and that was a very important reform for working people throughout the industrialised world, and beyond in some cases.In this legislation the Minister is trying to reverse a similar reform that gave workers in the public service the right, after a lengthy working life, to retire at 55 or 60. The Minister presumes to force them to stay at their posts until they are 65, thereby extending the working life by five or ten years in some cases. In this modern day and age, with technology going forward and labour-saving devices, that beggars belief, and the reactionary nature of it should be fully recognised.What is it about? It is about the agenda of neo-liberalism currently dominating the thinking of all Governments within the European Union and driving the policy and actions of the EU Commission. This is the agenda of the major multinational lobby groups that have the ear of the EU Commission and the Governments which currently rule the EU, and which have ready access to the Government which has the Presidency of the EU at any time.Undoubtedly this Government will also have its regular meetings in the course of the remainder of this Presidency with the European round table and the rest of the lobby groups of big business which deploy tens of millions of euro in lobbying to drive their agenda as the one accepted within the EU. Their agenda is to pare back pensions as far as they possibly can in order to maximise their ongoing profits, and to pare back public spending on pensions and on the public services so they can go cap in hand and demand even fewer corporate taxes than they are paying currently, certainly in the case of this country which is probably the lowest in the EU. What the Minister for Finance and the Government are doing with this Bill is implementing in legislation the agenda of big business inside the European Union. Let that be recognised.It is shameful that the leadership of the trade union movement here is not up in arms about this type of proposal. Many in the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, unfortunately, have become far too close to the Government. They are far too comfortable in the present arrangement between the Government, the bosses and the leaders of the trade union movement. Since 1987, they have made concession after concession, many of which have not even been seen and are not publicised in the media. For example, the amount of national production which now goes to working people on wages and salaries is far less as a proportion than it was in 1987 and the amount of production going to profits, rents and speculators is far greater. That is the result of so-called partnership but it is not partnership. It is a fraudulent pretence at partnership, and the trade union leadership should have rejected it out of hand as a thoroughly reactionary and backward proposal as far as workers are concerned.The Bill goes on to make certain exceptions for members of the Garda, the Army, fire-fighters, etc. It is obvious on the face of it that in regard to these professions which need people who are young, active, agile, etc., the Government felt obliged to put in these exceptions, although if I were these workers I would be watching my back over the next period.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I am opposed to this for all workers in the public service but I want to single out the case of teachers. This Government's contempt for the teaching profession appears to have no bounds, and we have seen many examples of that over the year. It is incredible, with all that we know about the difficulties, stresses and strains of teaching in our society, that this is being implemented strictly in regard to their profession. The Minister is forcing teachers to remain in the classroom until they are 65. What of the high-stress schools across the board? What will the Minister have in terms of teachers' health and morale at the age of 65 when this measure finally works its way through? He will have quivering wrecks in the classroom rather than vibrant educators, which is what is needed now. The fact that this is decades away should not in any way lessen our hostility and opposition to it. It should entrench that hostility and opposition because 30 and 40 years from now the conditions of life and work for working people should be much more favourable than they are currently, not dragged back in the direction of the 19th century.In the Bill we have rather prominently displayed the fact that politicians, Members of the Dáil and so on will be subject to it. It states that providing superannuation benefits for Oireachtas officeholders and Members of the Oireachtas or European Parliaments will not be payable before the age of 65 other than on grounds of ill-health or death, or where provided for in a scheme or enactment that applies to a new entrant and which is approved by the Minister for Finance after 31 March 2004.I could make a bet now. I will probably not be around in 30 or 40 years to collect it.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	206	All over the European Union labour relations have been convulsed in the past two years by the issue of so-called pension reform. Millions of workers have gone on strike and mobilised in opposition. The opposition is only beginning. I predict it will continue and intensify because workers understand the implications of the neo-liberal agenda. They will mobilise in response.In Ireland only the teachers' unions have expressed opposition. I urge them to become far more vocal. Rank and file members are extremely alarmed, even though it will not affect them, which is to their credit. They are thinking of their colleagues and the students of the future. The trade union movement should, therefore, take up the cudgels against this legislation.The other issue is the abolition of the mandatory retirement age. The Minister was lucky he had that little sweetener to put in to cover the more despicable aspects of the legislation. Nobody objects to the abolition of the mandatory retirement age which is a nonsense. When they reach 60 or 65 years of age, if they feel sufficiently healthy and have the morale and thirst to continue to make a contribution to society, whichever area of the public service they are in, people should be encouraged and facilitated in every way. Where it is appropriate and they are of the mind and have the capability to do so, their enormous experience will continue to be a boon to the public service. This should not, however, in any sense, be confused with coercion which the Minister is seeking to enforce. What will happen, unless there are many changes, is that teachers will be forced to leave the classroom long before normal retirement age and seek work elsewhere because they will not be able to maintain the requisite level of intensity.Mar focal scoir, an dhá pointe atá sa mBille seo, an chéad ceann, deireadh a chur leis an aois scor éigeantach darnálaithe áirithe an trálacha sa tseirbhís poiblí: aontaím ar fad leis sin.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for the their valued and constructive contributions to the debate on this Bill. As I said in my opening remarks, we tend to think of ourselves as a young population, with all of the benefits derived from this. It is a fact that we have one of the youngest populations in the European Union. However, this will change fairly quickly. Notwithstanding the difficulty of demographic projections, we cannot ignore the stark reality facing us over several decades in terms of an ageing population, greater longevity and a projected deterioration in the dependency ratio. In the context of these challenges and by comparison with many of our EU partners, we have breathing space in which to put in place the measures and balanced reforms necessary to ensure the future viability of public service pensions without adversely impacting on existing employees.Reform is essential. Maintaining the status quo is simply not an option. In this context, some contributors to the debate have raised the matter of the pension commission’s recommendation of a 1% contribution by all staff, both serving and new entrants, in respect of pensions. While the Government decided to accept the bulk of the commission’s proposals, it did not accept this particular recommendation. Neither did it accept the commission’s recommendation to establish an index to determine public service pension increases. Its decision in respect of these recommendations is in keeping with the decision not to change the pension and retirement ages of existing public servants. The 1% contribution recommendation had been referred for consideration to the public service benchmarking body which stated in its report that research had been commissioned into pension arrangements in the public and private sectors. Cost differences between the sectors were considered by the body and taken into account in its recommendations of salary and pay levels.In deciding on its package the Government took into account the comments of the body and the fact that its recommendations had been put in place following agreement with the public service unions. For the information of the House, a 1% pay contribution from all public servants would raise an estimated €130 million per year in 2004 terms. Based on a standard investment fund assumption of a real return of 3% per year, this could be expected to accumulate to an estimated €6.5 billion in constant 2004 pay terms by 2044. However, the net effect of any such contribution may not be considered in isolation from its impact on pay, particularly in the light of the report of the benchmarking body. Any extra pension contribution levied on public servants would almost certainly be factored into future pay determination negotiations. In this context, an additional 1% levy would be likely to result in rates being fully adjusted to allow for this contribution. If that were to happen, there would be no net benefit from the additional contribution and a considerable impact on existing pay arrangements.

I have answered parliamentary questions on a number of occasions on the reason we decided not to publish.The Bill builds on initiatives implemented in the general pensions area. They are both reasonable and straightforward and will prove in time to be both timely and appropriate forms to help ensure budgetary stability in the decades to come. I will now turn to some of the other issues raised by Deputies during the course of the debate.Some Deputies expressed concern about the validity of the demographic estimates quoted. I agree there can be great uncertainty about any projections 50 years into the future. However, most forecasters agree on at least one item: pension numbers are likely to treble over the next 50 years. I accept there is a wide range of opinions on the likely size of the labour force at that time. However, it would have to treble to keep the pensioner support ratio at its current level. In effect, the population would have to treble to 12 million. I doubt if anyone thinks this will happen. It is reasonable to plan on the basis of the comprehensive reports being carried out. The projections I quoted in my opening speech are underpinned by forecasts in the actuarial review of the financial condition of the social insurance fund carried out by the British Government's actuary department in June 2002.Several EU countries, such as France, Austria, Germany and the Scandinavian countries have to take action which adversely affected the pension position of serving staff. They left it too late. We need to learn from their experience and take limited action now. I confirm that the work of Dr. Fahy, published in 1997 and referred to by Deputy McGrath, was one of the major works consulted by the pensions commission in arriving at its recommendations and is listed in the bibliography contained in the commission's report.Deputy Burton and others suggested changes to the definition of "new entrants" in the Bill. The approach adopted is balanced, allowing a reasonable interim period within the overall context of a clear and practical definition. It takes account of staff on career break, secondment or any form of leave where the person has a right to return to the employment. Where such a person returns at the end of the period of leave, he or she will not be a new entrant. Account has also been taken of existing temporary, part-time, seasonal and contract staff and staff whose training is being carried out within existing employment arrangements. To extend these exceptions further would introduce inconsistencies that would dilute the impact of the measures the Government wishes to implement in this legislation.Some Deputies suggested that there is no distinction between a trainee garda and a student taking a course in a teacher training college but the distinction is clear. The student in the teacher training college does not have a contractual relationship with an employer and does not, unlike the trainee garda, move directly into employment on successful completion of training. Trainee teachers must apply for positions as they arise and they are appointed only if successful.Deputy Connaughton raised the position of new entrants to the psychiatric services. The pension arrangements for all new entrant psychiatric nurses will be brought into line with those applying to new entrant general nurses and psychiatric nurses in the voluntary hospital sector. This equalising measure is fully in accordance with the recommendations of the public service pensions commission. The special terms enjoyed by some psychiatric staff under the Mental Treatment Act 1945 derived from old prison officer terms but there has been a shift from a psychiatric institution based service to a community based service integrated with other health services and this has impacted on the work content and context of psychiatric nurses. The trend is increasingly towards voluntary admission to psychiatric facilities, which is obviously not the case in prisons. Generally, nursing now has more similarities and the pensions regime for new entrants into psychiatric and general nursing will be the same in future.Deputy Devins referred to the practice of giving hospital consultants added years to augment their pensions, an issue that is not dealt with in the Bill. The pensions commission recommended that schemes of notional added years be abolished for new entrants and should be replaced with other forms of recruitment incentive. Rather than abolish the scheme immediately there are proposals to continue it with a modified form for an interim period. There have been discussions with the unions concerned and other staff representatives. As regards hospital consultants, serving consultants will not be affected and I am well aware of the fears expressed by the future entrants.Deputy Paul McGrath asked about fast accrual for gardaí. This is not affected by the Bill. While it may be the case that certain new entrant gardaí will have accrued the maximum 40 years reckonable service before minimum retirement age, all of them will require the fast accrual facility to accrue maximum pension at minimum retirement age. The current trend is to enter the force at later stages and many new recruits will not have accrued full pension until their mid to late 40s. The fact that some new entrant gardaí will have accrued maximum pension some years before the minimum retirement age is no different from the position of staff in other areas of the public service.Deputy Burton referred to the refund of pension contributions paid by overseas doctors working here. She criticised the fact that such refunds are now payable for up to two years service only when previous refunds could be paid for up to five years service. It is not a matter comprehended by the present Bill. The reduction in the vesting period was introduced in the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, which was sponsored by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. It applies to all pension schemes, not just public service pension schemes.The Deputy inquired if ministerial powers under the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1976 could have been used to implement the changes in the Bill and in a related point she expressed doubt about the constitutional propriety of the Bill, citing the Carrickmines judgment. On the first point, this Bill covers the public service in its entirely whereas the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1976 limits the authority to amend legislation to certain specified legislation only, primarily related to pension arrangements for established civil servants. On this basis there could be no question of using the 1976 Act to accomplish the changes set out in this Bill. On the second point, the Carrickmines judgment was available when this Bill was drafted and the parliamentary counsel had regard to it. Any primary legislation amended by this Bill has been fully identified and the details of the proposed amendments are included in the second Schedule and in section 5.Deputy Burton also had the impression that the 1980 regulations were used to give legal authority to the proposals announced in the budget. I merely announced in the budget my intention to introduce legislation to implement the age related forms which I am now doing in this Bill.Several speakers in both Houses have criticised the proposals to increase the minimum retirement age to the general new standard retirement age of 65, expressing concerns about the capacity of teachers to cope adequately. An alternative approach suggested in both the Seanad and the Dáil is that five years be added to minimum ages across the board. It will allay Members' concerns to know that the majority of teachers already opt to work until age 60 or over rather than retire between 55 and 60. This trend is set to continue and become more pronounced in future given that new entrants are joining the labour force at a later age than heretofore, notably because of the introduction of degree courses for some teachers and later school leaving ages. Some teachers are also taking breaks from service and choose to accumulate the service later. In the circumstances, the proposal to increase teachers' minimum retirement age from 55 to 60 would have little impact. It would, however, maintain existing relativities.In line with its terms of reference, the pension commission conducted a more fundamental review of pension terms across the public service, having regard to historical background, fairness in terms of other groups, operational requirements, the changing environment and improvements in health and life expectancy. It was against these criteria that the commission recommended that standard terms apply to new entrant teachers. I agree with the commission's more fundamental approach and decided against simply adding five years to the minimum retirement ages of all employees across the public service.Deputies also expressed concern at the abolition of special early retirement facilities where teachers experience professional difficulties. The proposals in this Bill will have no impact on existing targeted early retirement facilities. Such facilities will have to be reviewed from time to time and that applies also to the teachers' pilot early retirement arrangements, which are due for review in a couple of years.The pensions commission received and considered a wide range of submissions from groups seeking early retirement terms given the stress being experienced by employees in the relevant areas. This applied to numerous areas in the public service. Stress is widely recognised as a factor in modern day working and must be addressed in various ways. In terms of pension provision, the pension commission, having considered all the submissions made to it, considered that the appropriate response was to introduce additional flexibility in the public service to enable public sector employees to plan to retire earlier if they wish, for example, through a combination of purchasing additional pension, known as SPEARS, and an actuarially reduced early retirement, or reverting to a lower level in the years before retirement without suffering a pensions penalty. The range of options is under discussion in a joint union-management group at present. The measures outlined allow people to plan ahead if they wish to retire before 65.Deputy Paul McGrath commented that the provisions of the Bill for Oireachtas Members and office holders were at variance with the terms of my budget speech. I do not accept that the Bill amounts to a change from my budget statement. Anyone who joins the Oireachtas for the first time after 1 April will be a new entrant. Anyone who becomes an office holder after 1 April having joined the Oireachtas for the first time after 1 April will also be a new entrant. The Bill represents the detailed implementation of my budget statement but takes account of the position of Members of the Houses where, as Deputy Paul McGrath himself said, there is less security of tenure than for any other group of public servants.I welcome the comments of some Deputies during the debate, including Deputies Twomey and Boyle, who saw no difficulty with the proposal to bring the pension age for new entrant Members into line with that for new entrants to the public service generally.Deputy McGrath commented that new entrants to the Oireachtas will be able to qualify for full benefits after 20 years' service but could have to wait a further 20 years to get those benefits. As I said in my opening speech to this debate, it is entirely reasonable and consistent that persons joining the Houses after 1 April be subject to the new entrants' terms, as they, unlike serving Members, will be fully aware of the new age limits before they join and will be able to take them into account in considering their circumstances.Deputy Boyle referred to the impact of proposals in the Bill on how current Members who have not yet attained ministerial office will be treated. I assure Members that any person who is currently or was in the past a Member of either House will not be considered to be a new entrant if he or she should become a Minister at some stage. The Bill introduces measures only for new entrants to the public service and removal of the compulsory retirement age is part of that set of measures. As stated in the Seanad, I am open to the removal of the compulsory retirement age for public servants, but in a context other than this Bill, which is to apply only to new entrants.Deputy Burton asked for figures regarding gardaí, teachers and nurses retiring early or on the grounds of ill health. In the two years 2001 and 2002, the number of primary and secondary teachers who retired under the limited early retirement scheme was 252. The number who retired on the grounds of ill health over the same period was 270. I am advised that the number of gardaí who retired on the grounds of ill health in 2001 and 2002 was 64. Given the multiplicity of employers in the health services, my information is that it is not possible to compile the number of ill health retirements in the time available.Deputy Mulcahy referred to increased pensions mobility between the public and private sectors. I agree with the concept of improved portability. It is not an issue covered in this Bill, but there are already provisions for the acceptance and payment of transfer value payments by public service schemes, subject only to the conclusion of a reciprocal arrangement with the other employers. Amendments were also made by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, which improved provisions for such payments to non-funded pension schemes. The question of ageism was raised, and my colleague the Minister has responsibility for pensions in the private sector, including equity aspects, which is why I am dealing only with the public service in my legislation.Deputies Bruton and Enright expressed disappointment that this Bill dealt only with age-related issues. However, as stated in my budget speech and elsewhere, the Government has accepted the bulk of the recommendations of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. My officials are involved in detailed discussions with union representatives and officials from other Departments on the introduction of various reforms mentioned in my budget speech. Those include changes in the calculation of pensions for lower-paid staff to increase their occupational pensions and the introduction of a package of flexibilities to facilitate employees in planning to retire before 65 through a combination of purchase of service and actuarial reduced pensions, as well as the option of a reduced level of responsibility in the years before retirement.Several Deputies referred to SPEARS. In keeping with the commission's recommendation, it is the wish and intention of the Government that SPEARS, which should furnish a more flexible method of providing the additional benefits than existing public service AVC and purchase schemes, apply to both serving public servants and new entrants. Discussions are already under way with the staff associations about that. Those developments will take time to introduce, and the Bill, which relates only to new entrants, is not the appropriate means.Deputies O'Sullivan and Ó Caoláin voiced concern about a lack of agreement with the social partners. It is true that it is not possible to get agreement on the proposals regarding the minimum retirement ages contained in the Bill, although considerable progress has been made on other non-age issues, and discussions are ongoing. As I emphasised in my speech, there have been lengthy discussions with the unions over two years, and all relevant issues were considered. However, it became clear that there would not be general agreement on increasing retirement ages, and the Government had to decide whether to take responsible, modest steps now or do nothing and face the prospect of taking more radical steps in future which may affect both existing staff and pensioners. The Government must have the right to decide policy in the national interest. We allowed every opportunity for agreement, but when that proved impossible, the Government had to take action.Deputy Deenihan raised the question of bad faith on the part of management in the implementation group discussions with the teachers, noting the discussion on compromise proposals for a minimum age that the teaching unions said they thought had been agreed. I understand that the management side was prepared to consider some reduction in the minimum retirement age of 65, subject to an overall agreement with all the union representatives. However, it was repeatedly made clear that nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. That was documented in the agreed report to the Government on the discussions. Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach agreement on key proposals, notably those related to minimum retirement ages. The working group was formed in January 2002 and reported in October 2003 following extensive discussions. I am satisfied that every opportunity was available to the unions to reach agreement with the management side in the working group. Unfortunately that was not possible.Deputy Joe Higgins raised the matter of corporate taxation. It is obvious to anyone that lower tax rates are conducive to the creation of more jobs, increasing incentives to work, and generate larger tax receipts. Without what has been done regarding corporation taxes, we would be facing an even greater problem meeting future pension costs. It cannot be stressed enough that we must take action now on the pensions issue. I have been concerned for some time that we in Ireland may be complacent. As I said in my speech yesterday, we are used to thinking of ourselves as a country of young people. For some in Ireland, it is other countries that must face the problems of ageing, and increasing dependency ratios do not affect us. I have heard comments that we do not really face a pensions problem in Ireland, that estimates of population change are always open to doubt, that increased migration flows will alter the picture, and that some way will always be found to tackle the problem.We must recognise that the issue is far too significant to be sidelined in that way. It is true that our population is younger than that of most of our EU partners, but it will age. The key point is that Ireland must use the opportunity that it has now to prepare for the future. I was very glad to see Brendan Keenan's article on pensions in this morning's Irish Independent, and I draw it to Members’ attention. In light of a new study on the issue by various European experts, Brendan Keenan lists policy issues about the funding of pensions which must be faced by Ireland and our EU partners in the years ahead. However, the main point is that he makes clear that we must take action.We have no excuse for surprise when our population begins to grey. Now is the time to decide how to deal with the problem in the most effective way.He states that "Ireland is not a mere interested spectator" and concludes that the "pensions burden will double by 2050 and increase by more than half in the next 25 years".I assure the House that the Government is not complacent on the pensions issue. As Minister for Finance, I must take steps now to secure the future position. I have already introduced several initiatives such as the national pensions reserve fund and major changes in the taxation code to encourage people to take out pension provision for themselves and their families. The changes in the pension arrangements for new entrants to the public service contained in the Bill are a further significant step in that process.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.Detailed planning and preparations for the countrywide use of electronic voting and counting at the European and local elections are proceeding. To date, 5,190 voting machines have been delivered to returning officers, software has been subjected to continuous testing, training of returning officers and their staff is continuing, and a public education and awareness campaign on the new system is under way. In addition, the Government this week appointed an electronic voting and counting commission to make reports to the Ceann Comhairle, the first to be received not later than 1 May 2004, on the secrecy and accuracy of the Nedap-Powervote system.My Department and independent local returning officers have exercised responsibility under successive administrations for the safe, accurate and efficient conduct of elections in Ireland. The Nedap-Powervote electronic voting and counting system has been designed, tested and proven in practice to meet these requirements. Systems embodying a so-called voter verifiable paper audit trail have not.Only a small minority of electronic voting systems in use worldwide incorporate this function. In Brazil, one of the countries which has most extensively adopted this approach, the Superior Electoral Court has now determined that the use of a paper trail should be phased out and reliance should be placed on electronic storage of votes only. Those advocating use of a parallel paper trail in Ireland have offered no evidence or practical experience of how voters interact with this system in the real election situation. In contrast, my Department has piloted the Nedap-Powervote system on two occasions and commissioned surveys demonstrating high voter satisfaction with it.The accuracy of the electronic voting and counting processes envisaged for Ireland has been extensively tested and verified. Tests involving a comparison of paper ballots and electronic votes have also been carried out and may be repeated as required to provide reassurance on the accuracy of the system. Use of a parallel paper system would involve a dual system in which constant confusion would arise as to whether the electronic data or the paper ballot would represent validly cast votes. In addition, the need to use printers throughout polling day would increase the likelihood of system malfunction, as occurred in a Belgian pilot scheme in 2003, following which the printer function has been abandoned.With regard to the making available of the election management source code, I have indicated that this matter will be examined later in the year when the system, including a profile to cover presidential elections, will have been fully completed.Election administration expenses have always been met from the Central Fund rather than voted by the Dáil. Section 37 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 applied this arrangement to the costs of acquiring electronic voting and counting systems. Following a Government decision of 30 October 2002, a letter of intent to purchase the voting machines, subject to certain conditions, issued on 28 January 2003. The commitment to purchase the voting machines was essentially conditional on the conditions in the letter of 28 January 2003 being met. The final contract was signed on 19 December 2003. Some €31.65 million has been spent to date on system hardware. The estimated cost of the system software is €467,000. Training is ongoing and cost details are not yet available. The total estimated cost of the project, excluding training costs, is €44 million, including VAT.The voter education and awareness campaign is estimated to cost €5 million of which €1 million is VAT. This programme will include approximately €1 million to promote awareness of the polls in June and encourage the electorate to vote. The campaign will also include a mail shot to every household in the country. The cost of the awareness campaign at the general election pilot for electronic voting was €263,000, and not €80,000 as has been wrongly quoted. This is consistent with the cost of the current campaign which is for the whole country and also incorporates the voter awareness campaign and the national mail shot.The introduction of electronic voting and counting is a desirable modernisation of the electoral system. It will improve the efficiency, speed, accuracy and user-friendliness of elections. It will also eliminate the democratic wastage associated with spoilt votes.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	How can the Minister reconcile his bluster regarding the technological strength of the system with the statement released yesterday by the Irish Computer Society — which is the policy committee — and its chief executive for software engineering who said that any electronic voting system must include a paper-based voter verified audit trail because it is the only way to prove or disprove the accuracy of the electronic count? How does the Minister match that statement from the Irish Computer Society with the Brazilian experience?If the Minister is so strong in his belief in the technological strength of the system, will he tell me how the software will address the petitions function and how it will be applied in the case of a court challenge to an electoral decision? Will he give me a straight answer to that question? The Minister should put aside his bluster about the strength of the system because he is on shaky technological ground. He is creating a crisis of confidence in the electoral system which can only be put right by the Government admitting that some major outstanding questions have not yet been answered.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	233	No.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	234	It is as simple as that. Every vote cast may be seen from number one to whatever number of preferences. The system has the capacity to do this, as I have outlined umpteen times. Equally, before polling begins on election day, the returning officer will get the findings of a paper audit of the system confirming that no votes are stored. There will also be confirmation in print-out format there was no interference with the ballot paper. This will have to be signed by the returning officer. It will be open to any representative of a candidate to also sign off on that issue with the returning officer. Equally, at the end of the process, the paper record will form part of the election process, as catered for in law. The system will sign-off on the number of votes cast and so on, which can be married with the number which has been ticked off on the register as having voted.I reject the inference that I have created doubts about this system. I agree that there has been a serious attempt to undermine it. I am delighted we did not opt for the system which operates in America. I would not trust that system either and it has rightly been questioned. They are PC-based and open to other systems but this one has been in use for many years and tested.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Is the Minister saying that the counting machine is not PC-based?

It is beginning to come to the conclusion that its outcry about a verifiable paper audit trail no longer provides a valid central thesis on the issue.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	239	It certainly is mine.

Will the Minister confirm that this option is open to it? In the event of such a recommendation being made and accepted by Government, does he have a contingency plan for the use of the traditional system of voting in the forthcoming elections?Given that the legislation required to allow electronic voting to be used in the European and local elections has not yet been published or introduced, much less enacted by the Oireachtas, will the Minister justify the expenditure of €50 million of taxpayer's money on his favourite toy? Could the Department not find something more useful on which to spend this sum such as the provision of bathroom extensions for people with disabilities who have been waiting for three years, or the provision of heating in houses which lack such basic facilities? Where is the promised legislation to allow the system to be used in the forthcoming elections?

I am happy, as I have said all along, to have it verified. On the question of a contingency plan, if there were to be such a scenario, the answer is yes. We would have time to return to the previous system of a paper ballot. We made sure to consider this and will have the capacity to do it. The sum is €44 million, not €50 million, as the Deputy suggested.

It was always the case that there would be a cost attached. That was clear when it was mooted two or three years ago. There were indicative figures at the time of the actual cost. There is an upfront capital cost but also a strong payback in the context of the overall cost of elections. It was never presented as a money saving venture——

The same applies to any other business that has embraced the world of technology in which we live. The same is true of the couple of million people who have bought mobile phones because they are more efficient, quicker and easier to use. The Oireachtas made that choice. There was not a dispute in the Houses of the Oireachtas between the parties about the move to electronic voting.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 128 together.There can be no excuse for illegal waste activities, irrespective of whether they take the form of illegal dumping within the State or the illegal exportation of waste to another jurisdiction. I have, therefore, introduced a number of significant initiatives designed to achieve more vigorous enforcement of the waste code.I took the opportunity by way of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 to provide new enforcement powers for the environmental authorities concerned and to increase the maximum fines that can be imposed for contraventions of the waste code. I have recognised the need for improved structural arrangements to underpin the enforcement effort. Last October I announced details of the establishment of a new Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, located within the Environmental Protection Agency. While it has a wide remit, the OEE, at my request, is focusing on waste related enforcement activities as a priority.I have allocated €7 million from the environment fund to support the first year of a major five year programme of local authority waste enforcement activities. The aim is to provide a stronger and more visible local authority enforcement presence on the ground and ensure more frequent inspections and speedier responses to reported instances of illegal dumping.I am not in a position to comment on individual cases of suggested illegal dumping in this jurisdiction as the investigation of such complaints is a matter for the relevant local authority, the OEE and, in some cases, the Garda. On reported incidences of illegal cross-Border dumping in Northern Ireland, the OEE is considering how the extent of such incidences might be more precisely established. I am aware that there are ongoing contacts on individual cases between the relevant authorities, North and South. I have also recenltly received correspondence on the matter from Omagh District Council, in response to which I have sought a report from the OEE. The relevant authorities in this jurisdiction will co-operate actively with the authorities in Northern Ireland with a view to dealing effectively with illegal cross-Border movements of waste.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Is the Minister satisfied with the action being taken by his Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, local authorities and the OEE? If so, why is the activity of illegal dumpers continuing? If not, what action will he take to make the relevant groups more effective? He will agree that they have not been effective given that between six and eight 40-foot trucks per day are trundling in and out of Eskra, County Tyrone, containing documents from a Department. Does he agree that waste from the State is mounting in illegal dumps throughout the North, in Border areas in particular, because of a lack of activity and seriousness on the part of the relevant agencies in pursuing the illegal operators? Does he further agree that it is increasingly evident that illegal waste contractors are getting a clear message that they are free to continue their illegal activity, in the North in particular?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I agree with the Deputy in that there was a weakness in the system and that we needed to upscale enforcement of waste regulations substantially. We have done this in the past year with the support of all Members of the Oireachtas and it is already beginning to have a significant effect.I do not agree that wholesale dumping is taking place in Northern Ireland but if Sinn Féin, given its extensive contacts, has information on who is engaged in illegal dumping, I would be delighted to receive it. Equally, I would be very pleased if it informed the Garda or the OEE in the Environmental Protection Agency.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Or the PSNI.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Yes. All of these bodies can combat the problem. I can only act on the facts as they are presented but if the Deputy has more information, we would be more than happy to receive it.It is not necessarily illegal to ship waste, for which there is a legal basis. There are legal activities but as the Deputy is well aware, there are always those who seek to undermine and break the law, and they can be very clever in doing so. We must be ever vigilant regarding such activities. The OEE which is now beginning to take major action will certainly be of great assistance.As a matter of interest to the House, I was astonished about ten days ago while trying to get onto the M50 not far from Rathfarnham when I saw a major roadblock. When I approached it, I asked what it was for and was told it had been initiated by the local authority and the Garda to detect illegal dumping. It was the first time I had come across such a roadblock.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	311	No. It was a spot check. I was thrilled to see the authorities doing such a check and assure the Deputy that they were surprised to see me. Everybody was happy.Such activities are very much part of the efforts being made by the local authorities, the Garda and the OEE within the Environmental Protection Agency. I very much welcome this development and hope to see many local authorities and the Garda co-operating in making spot checks throughout the country. If they do not rid us entirely of the problem, we can certainly reduce it to a manageable level. Those operating illegally will be brought to book. Any effort Members of the House can make in achieving this end will be very welcome.

Were investigations launched? If so, when will the results be available and will the House be informed of them? Does the Minister agree that the Government's failure to pursue a policy of reduce, reuse and recycle is one of the root causes of the waste management crisis and fuelling the illegal dumping of waste?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I have stated I recently received correspondence on the matter from Omagh District Council, in response to which I sought a report from the OEE. Obviously, there is much contact at official level. I do not have any further details of individual contacts but my Department certainly works very closely with its co-Department in Northern Ireland. We are involved in many issues together. There is weekly contact. As the Deputy knows, we are taking an all-island approach to resolving some waste management issues.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The policy of my Department, continuing that of successive Departments which have held responsibility for nature conservation, is to prohibit, on properties acquired for conservation purposes, any activities that would adversely affect the purposes for which the lands were acquired or interfere with the enjoyment and safety of members of the public availing of the resource. In this context, hunting on properties managed by the national parks and wildlife service of my Department has remained prohibited. This is a matter of national policy, rather than being mandated by international agreements.I have recently examined this policy closely following requests by the National Association of Regional Game Councils that their members should be given access to some national parks and wildlife properties for the purpose of shooting game. For the following reasons, I have concluded that the prohibition of shooting on these properties should continue. First, the sites were acquired, in general using public funds, for the purpose of nature conservation and to serve as refuges and breeding places for species of wildlife. Hunting could also disturb "non-quarry" species and their habitat, thereby reducing the value of these sites as refuges for wildlife generally. Second, facilities for hunting are extensively available on Coillte lands, as well as those of private owners, and on foreshore. Third, I had to take account of considerations of public safety and the potential exposure of the State to claims for damages by persons harmed or otherwise adversely affected by hunting on national parks and wildlife services properties. The Heritage Council has recommended against any change in the long-standing policy of not permitting hunting on national parks and wildlife lands.In reaching my conclusions on this matter I also had available the report of a joint scientific group comprising officials of my Department and nominees of the NARGC. Whereas this group considered that scientific reasons would not obtain for an automatic ban where hunting was sustainable, its report did not advance specific advice on how populations and sustainability should be assessed. While the group's report did propose a methodology for considering this matter further, the implementation of this would require significant national parks and wildlife personnel resources which would have to be diverted from other priority work. For the reasons indicated, I did not consider that the report of the scientific group justified a departure from the existing established policy in this matter.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Will the Minister confirm that Deputy Brendan Smith in representing him at the regional game council's AGM last October indicated that there would be a relaxation of the regulations on hunting on State-owned lands? Can he confirm also that the report to which he referred showed that there was no scientific basis for a blanket ban on hunting on State owned lands and that there were no international or European regulations which prevented such hunting?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I am aware of what my colleague, Deputy Smith, said in good faith and which was accurately reported at the time. He had a note from my Department which indicated that I was considering the issue and that I was probably likely to allow for three pilot schemes to operate. That was factually correct at the time but I have now come to a different conclusion. A key point that sways me is that the total amount of land managed on behalf of the people by the national parks and wildlife service is only 1.08% of the total land bank, a tiny proportion. There are extensive Coillte and private lands available for hunting. Many people, children and families, enjoy the national parks and to allow shooting with the inevitable dangers to them would be a very foolish move.When this matter first came to my attention, I thought that there was a large proportion of land under the national parks and wildlife service but was astonished to find it was such a small fraction of the total land bank. If we cannot preserve this land which was bought with taxpayer's' money for everyone to enjoy in safety, there is something wrong. The extensive Coillte and private lands available more than meet the needs of hunting. I am not opposed to hunting and shooting but have to make a balanced judgment. This is the correct one.

I was considering this and was minded that way until I received all the assessments and the scientific report, which it is true, did not provide a substantive reason for prohibiting hunting or shooting.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	334	Did the Minister decide on safety grounds?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	335	There were many factors. One has to ask the reason for which the lands are bought and for whose benefit. It is a benefit for most of the people. When I realised that the percentage of lands involved was so minuscule, I was not minded to put at risk the lives of children and families who use the lands extensively. Had I felt this was extremely unfair to the hunting lobby and that a large portion of land was being removed from it, I might have acted differently but it is only 1.08% of the total land bank while hunting is available on the vast lands held by Coillte and on a large portion of private lands. This was the wisest decision in the public interest.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	336	In preparation for international emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union is establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading to commence in January 2005. The Government has agreed to make available to the emissions trading sector, comprising about 100 installations in the powergen, large industry and large institutional sectors, an average of 22.5 million allowances per annum over the three year pilot, "learning by doing", phase of this scheme to the end of 2007.The EU emissions trading scheme creates a new commodity, an "allowance" equivalent to one tonne of CO2, valid only for the purpose of meeting the requirements of Directive 2003-87-EC establishing the scheme. Operators in the 15,000 installations across the enlarged European Union must surrender annually one allowance for each tonne of CO2 emitted in the previous year, and to meet this obligation, may trade in these allowances. Their value will be determined by the market in them, and this will act as a powerful incentive, through the internalisation of environmental costs, for companies to identify and implement emissions reductions measures at or below the prevailing market price. All companies will wish to avoid exposure to the need to purchase allowances at a price higher than in-house reduction costs and avail of the opportunity to sell spare allowances thus generated on the market.The Government is bound by the terms of the Directive 2003-87-EC to make available at least 95% of allowances free of charge. The total value of the allocation for the three years 2005-7 equates to €675 million, based on a price estimate of €10 per tonne of CO2 predicted by the consultants advising Government. That is the price generally expected to emerge in the European Union. While the EU emissions trading scheme creates a market for a new asset, there are no financing costs for Government in this process but there are stringent penalties in place to ensure companies do not exceed their limits. The penalty in the pilot phase is €40 per tonne of CO2 emitted which is not offset by an allowance surrendered and cancelled, rising to €100 per tonne from 2008.A total of 0.75% of the allowances will be auctioned to defray the administrative costs in the EPA and there are other provisions in the draft national allocation plan published by the EPA for auctioning that may benefit the Exchequer. These are the auctioning of any allowances not issued from the new entrant's reserve, and any not issued to installations which close.

Will he confirm that his recommendation to Government was closer to the minimum than the figure eventually allocated? Why were allocations made to sectors in excess of current emissions? The largest sector, power generation, is getting 14.5 million allowances compared with current emissions of about 14 million allowances. The cement and lime sector is getting almost four million allowances compared with current emissions of about 3.5 million. The heading other combustion is getting about three million allowances compared with current emissions of 2.6 million. If the object of the exercise is to reduce emissions, why has the Government allocated to the largest polluters allowances in excess of the amounts they are already emitting?Ultimately who will pay for this? Will the Minister confirm he has in his Department a report from Byrne Ó Cléirigh which estimates that average electricity bills for the householder could go up by almost 30% when the regime, including carbon tax, is in place? Has the Government made a decision to give what is, in effect, a subsidy to pollute to large polluting enterprises and sectors of industry while the householder and motorist will end up paying for this largesse through increased electricity and petrol prices?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank the Deputy for his questions. I would have expected him to ask such questions, many of which are the same as the ones I asked myself. This area was one of the most difficult for me to understand. I spent months trying to understand the creation of a market and how it would work. I had to be sure that it could deliver. If the figure emerges, for example, at €10 per tonne, companies will have two choices. They can do nothing and their allocation should roughly equate to what their CO2 emissions will be, which would mean they would have no gain. We do not want this, rather we want a real environmental approach to this issue. Built into this system is strong encouragement for companies to reduce. After 2012 circumstances will be far more severe for all countries, including Ireland.If the average is about €10 per tonne, we expect many companies will see a value in making substantial investment in emissions reduction and may then see the benefit. The system contains a carrot and a stick. This represents learning by doing, the general view in the European Union. Potentially, much money is at stake. We all must be extremely careful about how we look at this matter, both from an Irish and European point of view. After 2008 there will be serious issues.The Deputy also asked about the balance. The figures for actual output in Ireland are hotly disputed and depend on the consultants to whom one speaks. While some would put the figure much higher, I do not. I accept the figures on which we have based this assessment. However, others dispute them. While reputable companies have been employed to demonstrate that the figures may be higher, we are operating from the lower figure.What has happened in the economy over the past ten years and more importantly over the past five or six years has had an impact on our energy needs. We negotiated a figure in 1998 which was 13% higher than our 1990 emissions level. However, we have now gone substantially beyond this. At one stage we were 31% higher but are now at about 28.5% or 29% higher. We have an enormous task to get back to the 13% level by 2012. At this stage the indications are that while we will achieve it, it will be at a price. This is not a pain free exercise and depends on everybody buying into and understanding the system.There needs to be balance between competitiveness in the economy and environmental costs — a delicate balance. There is a very fine line. I believe we are at that line which could move a point or two one way or the other. We are not absolute in this, nor is any country in Europe. During the Council of Ministers meeting this week when the issue came up, we asked the Commission to give its views. Clearly, it had concerns about the allocations countries were considering making. While the Deputy is right in saying I had a lower figure in mind, I rightly had to listen to the arguments, as one would. I tried to balance all of the issues.

We are at a very early stage of this process. The Deputy is absolutely on the mark with his questions. Ministers in all European countries are grappling with this issue. Clearly, those who champion competitiveness are not necessarily concerned with the environmental issues on the other side. What is happening in America gives me great heart about the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which I believe will happen.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	342	While we do not want to see the price of electricity increase, time will tell. Clearly, there will be some marginal movement. There will be costs to the power generation sector in general in becoming more efficient. Ireland's big disadvantage is that generation is heavily fossil fuel based. That is the reason my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I have been singing the mantra of trying to upscale substantially the level of wind energy generated. More than 25% or 30% of Denmark's energy comes from wind, which shows it works and can be efficient. I would like to see Ireland do the same.

There has been no undue delay in the processing of applications, having regard to the unprecedented volume of applications received in the three week period following the announcement of the termination of the scheme. Every effort is made to ensure grants are paid as soon as possible following receipt of claim for payment, with the services of five inspectors, who had retired, being retained to undertake inspections and inspectors being deployed between areas in response to fluctuating workloads.

We allowed an extension for those who received approval in November or December 2002.We gave that extension a few months ago to 2 April next. In 2001 there was in excess of 10,000 applications and in 2002 there was in excess of 25,000 applications, nearly 14,000 of which came in a three-week period. The applications are being processed. The deadline for occupancy was extended from before Christmas to 2 April next and reminders are being sent to everybody to the effect that this will be the final deadline. There are 36 inspectors working on this, including people who had retired and were retained. There is tremendous work still going on. People have until 2 April to notify the Department that they are in occupation and wish to draw down the grant.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 139 together.The affordable housing initiative under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement is designed to meet the needs of persons currently priced out of the housing market. In response, the Government has committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing through this initiative and the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.Measurable progress has been made on delivering this initiative. First, the identification of sites for the initiative last July and December has been a critical step in ensuring early mobilisation of affordable housing for the initiative. Together with affordable housing coming through Part V arrangements, the sites so far identified have the potential to deliver 6,100 housing units. The fact that these sites are being released by both local authorities and a range of other State authorities indicates the broad commitment at Government level to facilitate the earliest delivery of housing at affordable prices.Second, working with the parties to the pay agreement we have developed a delivery model which builds upon the existing expertise of local authorities, while at the same time ensuring that there is no impact on general Government finances, as this is one of the parameters set by the agreement. The housing will therefore be delivered through arrangements between local authorities and the private sector.Third, we have agreed, in principle, eligibility criteria with the parties to the pay agreement subject to further discussions on the detail. The timescale for delivery and the precise number of units to be delivered on each site is being determined in planning the projects. There are more than 24 projects involved, and they vary in terms of key site characteristics such as zoning status and servicing. Allowance must also be factored in for the procurement of specific developers to deliver the projects through competitive tendering and for obtaining planning permission. These processes, while involving a time element, are necessary to ensure the effective delivery of housing and the creation of housing in good quality environments.Work on implementing this initiative is progressing as a priority and consultations are continuing with Departments, State agencies and local authorities. This is firm evidence of the Government's determination to making measurable progress in the implementation of this initiative by the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress. We will work to ensure that the output from all affordable housing schemes is maximised while ensuring the continuation of measures to maintain the overall supply of new houses.

The Minister tells us that sites have been identified for 6,000 houses, but that 6,000 includes those coming through under Part V, which were not intended to be part of the 10,000 in the first place. My first question is for how many houses have sites been identified under this new affordable housing scheme, excluding those coming through under Part V? The Minister says none of the houses has been built, that none has been started and that no planning application has been lodged for a single one of these houses. Has an architect or architects been appointed to begin design work and the preparation of a planning application in respect of any of the sites?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	366	It is difficult to say exactly how many units will be on any site until detailed planning is done and a planning application is lodged.

The site has to be purchased and one must ensure that it is properly zoned and serviced. One must also study how one intends to proceed and how the project will be financed. It must then be designed and planning permission obtained. There is a team working on these different aspects and we are committed to providing 10,000 affordable houses. That will be done.

The provision of sites from State lands owned by different Departments and Government agencies was announced last July and before Christmas. Work on those sites is proceeding in terms of clearing them and ensuring that they are vacated. Some of them must then be serviced, while others must be zoned. There will then be the detailed planning, design and building phases to be undergone. Many different matters are under discussion but the process is being driven forward quickly.

The Minister of State is putting out a smokescreen. As an architect and town planner, I am aware that it does not take 14 months to appoint an architect. It is not acceptable 14 months after the announcement in which the Minister of State promised the sun, moon and stars, to say that zoning is being considered. It is a sop to the unions and it should be seen as such.

This Bill provides for the establishment of commissions of investigation. The function of a commission of investigation will be to investigate into and report on matters referred to it that are considered to be of significant public concern.The House will be aware that the Bill has its historic origins in the need to provide a means for investigation into the child sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. It is generally accepted that the very public and sometimes adversarial nature of tribunals of inquiry does not lend itself to investigation of matters of such a sensitive and intensely personal nature. Nonetheless, such inquiry needs to have at its disposal powers which are no less vigorous and effective in the pursuit of answers to difficult questions. Separate from that instance, Government had recognised the need to devise a new form and method of inquiry in any event.In a useful and significant way this Bill adds to the range of mechanisms available for investigations. It contains several new features that will ensure more timely and cost effective investigations, without compromising or encroaching upon the proper conduct of an investigation. In fact, the opposite will be the case as the extra features will, instead, enhance the ability of a commission of investigation to meet its objective of establishing the facts about any matter referred to it. I also believe the interests of justice and accountability will be advanced by a speedy conclusion to an investigation.The fact that the Bill facilitates more cost-effective investigation is a not insignificant consideration. It is estimated that between 1997 and October 2003 the accumulated cost to the State of tribunals and other major inquiries was more than €100 million. That figure does not include third party costs. Many of the tribunals and inquiries are ongoing. The approximate annual cost of these ongoing tribunals and inquiries is some €47 million. The accumulated cost overhang in respect of third parties could run to hundreds of millions of eurosIt is essential that the issue of costs of inquiry be addressed and this measure achieves that without in any way diluting the effectiveness or efficiency of the inquiry. Before explaining what the Bill contains and how a commission of investigation will go about its business, it is important to have a clear picture of what the Bill does not do. This legislation does not replace or amend in any way the legislation under which tribunals of inquiry are established and operated. While commissions may, as we shall see, be regarded as precursors or alternatives to tribunals, the Bill makes no changes to legislation relating to tribunals.It is important to note that the Bill does not establish a single or permanent investigations body. It enables the establishment of commissions as and when required, and it is one of the attractions of the new legislation that several commissions may sit at one time, investigating several and varied matters. In other words, the Bill gives the State and the Oireachtas a flexible investigative mechanism.Several of the new departures and innovative approaches to be found in the Bill are particularly important and worthy of emphasis. I will, therefore, draw the attention of the House to aspects of the Bill which relate to the terms of reference of a commission and to the guiding principles which aim to encourage co-operation. I will explain the way it will conduct its investigations and the strong powers available to a commission, as well as the provisions designed to ensure time limits are respected and costs are kept under control. I will underline the importance of the reports of commissions. Given these features, I hope Deputies will agree that the Bill introduces a timely and effective additional mechanism to ensure accountability and transparency in our public affairs.Before addressing these aspects of the Bill, the most basic question is when and in what circumstances we envisage commissions being established. The Bill provides that a commission will be established on foot of a Government order approved by the Oireachtas. The subject matter must, in the words of the Bill, be an issue giving rise to "significant public concern". An issue giving rise to significant public concern is one that is of more than mere interest to the public; it must, instead, be an issue which has serious, including long-term, implications for public life. These implications could include the welfare and safety of a sector in society or the effective and safe operation of a significant public service.While the Bill provides the mechanism and structure for the operation of investigations, it will remain the function of the Government of the day and the Oireachtas, as the representatives of society at large and the guardians of the public interest, to make the judgment in any particular case as to whether an issue is of such significant public concern that it requires investigation by a commission.It has come to be recognised that having clear and well defined terms of reference which are tightly drawn is often the key to a successful investigation. The Bill addresses this issue directly in sections 4 and 5. The process leading to the establishment of a commission starts with the presentation to the Oireachtas of a reasoned statement of the need to establish a commission, with the draft establishment order. Following the approval of the order by the Oireachtas, the terms of reference are to be set by the Government or the Minister with overall responsibility for the commission in question. Consultations may take place with interested parties about the terms of reference but the terms must, in the final analysis, comply with the detailed parameters set out in section 5.Section 5 requires that the systems or specific events, activities or circumstances to be investigated are identified and that the periods and locations or persons to which an investigation relates are specified. Deputies will agree that observance of these criteria will result in tight and well defined terms of reference. It will also be noted that section 5 requires that the terms of reference must be accompanied by statements setting out the likely duration of an investigation, as well as its cost. The terms of reference and the accompanying statements on costs and duration will be published.Section 6 recognises that terms of reference may need to be altered on occasion, but it states that any amendment must be for clear purposes, either to clarify, extend or limit the scope of an investigation. The statements as to costs and timeframes must also be amended when the terms are altered. This will ensure that the full implications of any alteration are clear to all. It is worth noting that amendments may only be made where the commission consents and it may withhold that consent where it is satisfied that the amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the commission.I am satisfied that the overall effect of these important sections is that we are, in this legislation, ensuring that all the difficult matters which have come to beset other investigations and inquiries are met and addressed at the outset. The scope for subsequent surprises should, therefore, be considerably reduced.In keeping with the general aim of the Bill, section 7 adopts a flexible approach to determining the membership of commissions. This arises because of the variety of circumstances in which commissions may be established. Under the terms of section 7, we will be able to draw on a wide range of skills and expertise and will be able to achieve the right mix of such skills and expertise. The experience and qualifications of the members can be supplemented by experts who can be recruited under section 8 to assist and advise the members. My aim is to ensure that all investigations, irrespective of the subject matter, will be carried out by those most qualified to do so and sections 7 and 8 will ensure this will be the case.Section 9 sets out the guiding principles by which all commissions must operate. A commission will be required to seek the voluntary co-operation of witnesses and the Bill places a responsibility on it to facilitate witnesses in that respect. It is not possible, given the multitude of circumstances in which a commission may operate, to state the manner in which a commission will meet that obligation, but one can speculate that, for example, it will be prepared to hear evidence in locations and at times that are more convenient for the witness, and that it will accept evidence, subject to certain safeguards, in forms other than in person, for example, by live or pre-recorded video links or by affidavit.Section 10, which provides that, in general, evidence shall be given to a commission in private, complements section 9 and will support a commission in adhering to the guiding principles to which I referred. I say this because the arrangements set out in section 10 will result in a less adversarial atmosphere. This is designed to encourage witnesses who might otherwise be intimidated by, for example, the prospect of lengthy and detailed cross-examination, to come forward and assist the commission.Section 10 provides that legal representatives of other parties will be present only if the commission is satisfied that their presence is necessary in the interests of the investigation and of fair procedures. Likewise, cross-examination by or on behalf of other parties will take place only where the commission agrees. However, the commission may question a witness on the evidence he or she has given.While I recognise that, in certain respects, the procedures in section 10 represent a departure from current practice, the new approach is designed to assist a commission in its primary task of establishing facts while, at the same time, ensuring that the procedures are fair. Since the hearings will generally be in private, the risk of damage to the good name or reputation of another is greatly reduced, as also is the need for legal representation. Private hearings also have the advantage of avoiding circumstances in which claims are publicly made by one party, but remain unanswered for a considerable period until the person affected comes to give his or her evidence. There is a real risk in those circumstances that unfounded or inaccurate claims can appear to go unchallenged and the good name and reputation of certain persons can be gravely and unjustly damaged. The new approach should reduce that risk.While the issues to which I have referred are important, it is also important that private hearings are not abused in a way that would allow unfounded allegations and claims to be made or go unchallenged. Section 11 addresses this concern by providing that a commission should make any person who may be the subject of such claims or allegations aware of the claims or allegations, and those persons should be given an opportunity to deal with them. While no obligation is being placed on a commission to reveal the source of any evidence given, there may be occasions when in view of the purposes of the investigation and having regard to fair procedures, those details will have to be disclosed.Section 14 requires a commission to establish or adopt rules and procedures relating to its operation. Deputies will note that those rules may, where a commission has several members, authorise the taking of evidence by one or more of those members. It adds that the evidence given in those circumstances will be regarded as having been given to the commission. This is an important feature which could help speed up investigations and save time and cost.I turn to the powers being given by this legislation to commissions of investigation. While commissions will do everything reasonably possible to ensure voluntary co-operation from witnesses, they will also be in a position to pursue an investigation with vigour where such co-operation is not forthcoming. The Bill provides effective powers to deal with such non-co-operation, set out, in particular, in sections 15 and 27.Section 15 specifies powers available to a commission regarding witnesses, including powers to direct witnesses to attend, to answer questions and to produce and disclose documents. Section 27 contains powers relating to entry into premises, inspecting and securing documents, taking copies of documents and requiring persons having charge of documents or related equipment to co-operate with the commission. All witnesses appearing before a commission are to be made aware that in the absence of co-operation, the commission may have recourse to the powers available to it under these sections. Furthermore, I draw attention to section 2(2) which provides a useful clarification on the question of who has control over documents, especially in large organisations. It states that in the final analysis, the person who can reasonably be considered to have control is in fact deemed to have control unless there is evidence to the contrary. This provision closes a potential loophole that could be open to abuse.The Bill creates several offences of failure to comply with directions, of giving false statements and of obstruction. These offences carry fines on summary conviction of up to €3,000 or to a term of imprisonment for up to 12 months, or on indictment, to fines of up to €300,000 or five years imprisonment. It includes provision under which corporate bodies may be prosecuted for offences. In the event of a person not complying with a direction to attend or produce documentation, a commission may apply to the High Court for an order-in-aid seeking compliance. Failure to comply with that order raises the issue of contempt of court.The powers being given to a commission of investigation under this Bill are necessary for the effective functioning of commissions. However, I also recognise that the powers are significant and it is for that reason that, for example, section 26 sets out the principles governing the use of the powers of entry and search. The powers may only be used if it is felt to be reasonable and necessary to do so in the interests of the investigation. I also point out that nothing in this Bill prevents anyone who is the subject of a direction from the commission under sections 15 or 27 from seeking a review of that direction by the High Court.I would like to draw the attention of the House to section 20 in the context of a commission's powers and operating procedures. That section sets out how a commission may deal with situations where privilege is claimed in respect of information sought by a commission. The purpose is to find an effective but proportionate way of overcoming difficulties presented by claims of privilege. Such claims, especially where there is no justification for them, can seriously frustrate and delay the work of an investigation. The mechanism proposed in section 20 ensures that genuine claims will be respected while at the same time ensuring that the necessary information is made available to the commission. The section also provides that a commission may cause a summary version of a document, which contains privileged information, to be prepared where that is possible and the interests of the investigation and fair procedures are served by so doing. A person whose claim of privilege over a document is the subject of a determination by a commission that all or part of the document should be admitted in evidence may, within ten days of the determination, bring an appeal to the High Court under section 21 against the commission's determination.I want to turn now to the important area of costs, or more precisely, the control of costs. Starting from the beginning of any investigation, as was noted earlier, the terms of reference must be accompanied by a statement from the relevant Minister of the costs likely to be incurred by the commission. This statement is to be revised in the event of the terms being altered. The costs covered by this statement will relate to costs to be incurred by the commission, including costs of experts appointed to assist it in accordance with section 8, including barristers and solicitors, where appointed.The Bill contains a number of provisions relating to the circumstances in which witnesses may have their costs met in whole or in part by the relevant Minister. Generally, the Bill deals only with the repayment of legal costs, which I will deal with presently, but it does make some provision for non-legal costs. Section 15(3) provides for the payment of witness expenses. The relevant Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, will draw up guidelines for this purpose. Expenses in this context are likely to include items such as travel costs. Section 16 provides that where a witness is held to have failed to co-operate or obstructed the commission and the commission or other witnesses have incurred additional costs as a result, then the party who causes the delay or obstruction may be held liable for those additional costs. Liability for the costs of the commission or other witnesses may be imposed on persons in addition to being proceeded against for the offence of obstruction under this Bill. It should be understood that obstruction is likely to have serious consequences.On legal costs, section 22 provides for guidelines to be prepared by the relevant Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, in advance of the commission's hearings setting out what legal costs will be regarded as being necessarily incurred by witnesses in connection with the investigation. These are the only legal expenses a witness can expect to recoup. Legal costs will be necessarily incurred where the good name of a witness is called into question or where other personal or property rights are at risk of being jeopardised as a result of evidence received by the commission. The guidelines prepared under section 22 may restrict the types of legal services or fees to be recouped and may set limits on the level of legal costs to be paid. Each witness will be furnished with a copy of the guidelines in advance of his or her giving evidence. This ensures that witnesses who wish to do so can arrange legal representation with full knowledge of the regime under which they may seek to have those costs recouped.A commission is obliged, in accordance with section 12(2), to advise the witness of his or her legal rights and obligations where a witness is not legally represented for whatever reason. The result is that even where the commission considers that legal representation is not necessary to the extent that it will approve the recoupment of costs and the witness does not therefore acquire legal representation, the commission will seek to ensure that the witness is fully aware of all of his or her legal rights.While the guidelines in section 22 provide information on the types of services and levels of legal costs that may be recouped, they do not give an automatic guarantee that legal costs incurred by the witness will in fact be met. Each situation will require consideration on its own merits, having regard to the criteria set out in section 23. All applications will be subject, in particular, to the criteria in section 23(3) which sets out a non-exhaustive list of issues to be considered by the commission. These include the complexity of the evidence given by the witness, the volume of documentation supplied, whether the evidence was given in private, whether the witness was cross-examined and the potential consequences for that witness of the final report.Having considered the application, the commission may give a direction to the relevant Minister to pay costs at a level that does not exceed the maximum set out in the guidelines. The recommended level may be lower than in the guidelines. The Minister may either pay the costs as directed by the commission or may refer the matter back to it for reconsideration. That reconsideration may be based on aspects of the guidelines in section 22 or on the criteria in section 23(3) or, in certain cases, the Minister may ask that the ability of the witness to meet the costs should be considered further. The commission may, following reconsideration of the matter, reduce the proposed level of payment or confirm its original determination. The Minister shall then pay to the witness the costs as recommended by the commission.Section 23(5) makes a limited exception to the general regime on costs. That will occur where a witness incurs exceptional costs other than legal costs, because of the volume or location of documents, for example, documents held outside the State. In those circumstances, the commission may direct that such exceptional costs may be repaid to the witness and as in the case of legal costs, the relevant Minister may request the commission to reconsider any direction about the repayment of such costs.I have been anxious to spell out in some detail the provisions relating to costs, in particular, legal costs. In addressing the question of legal costs, the Bill takes account of the overall structure being put in place, including the level of risk to the good name and reputation of any witness because, as I expect, private hearings will be the norm. It is reasonable to say that the lower level of risk to the good name and reputation of any witness should be reflected in a reduced need for legal representation. On the other hand, the Bill ensures that costs that are necessarily incurred — and that is the critical phrase — in the protection of a person's good name and reputation will be recouped. It sets out to achieve a balance between the wider public interest to control costs and the protection of the rights of individuals to their good name. The proposals on costs achieve that balance.Part 5 of the Bill deals with the reports and interim reports of a commission. Section 31 addresses the core point and provides not only that a commission must prepare for the relevant Minister a written report based on the evidence received by it but also states the precise purpose of the report, namely, to set out the facts it has established on the matter referred to it. It is not the function of a commission to speculate or to make findings or to reach judgments based on the balance of the evidence. However, by virtue of having become a matter requiring the establishment of a commission of investigation, there is likely to be dispute about some or all aspects of the evidence. Again, there is a balance to be achieved. It would be unreasonable to expect a commission to merely set out the conflicting evidence and offer no comment even where certain comment would be justified by the clear weight and quality of some or all of that evidence. Such an approach would undermine the credibility of a commission as it alone would be unable to draw conclusions that would seem obvious to all other observers. Section 31(2) addresses this issue and enables a commission to indicate its opinion as to the quality or weight of evidence relating to any area where the evidence is incomplete, insufficient, inconsistent or disputed. It does not go so far as to say that a commission may favour or find that one version of the evidence is more credible than another. It does, however, permit it to point out that, for example, certain disputed facts are supported by corroboration from other sources or that the clear majority of witnesses affected by a particular event support one version as opposed to another. Statements of that nature merely summarise where the weight of the evidence lies and they are, to that extent, merely stating what will be obvious to all.I draw attention to some aspects of the Bill as they relate to the possible identification of persons in reports compiled by a commission. There is no general restriction in the Bill on the identification of persons in reports of a commission. However, section 31(3) sets out considerations that may lead to the omission of certain details from a report identifying persons who gave evidence or any other person. The grounds include where the context in which the person was identified has not been clearly established or where disclosure might prejudice any criminal proceedings pending or in progress or where it would not be in the person's interest and the omission would not be contrary to the interests of the investigation or any subsequent inquiry.Sections 33, 34 and 35 contain provisions providing for an opportunity to persons identified in or identifiable from a draft report to submit comments thereon to the commission on the grounds that there has been a failure to observe fair procedures or in order to protect commercially sensitive information. A commission is required to give due consideration to requests for alterations and it may either amend the report, apply to the High Court for directions or submit the report to the relevant Minister without alteration. In the alternative, a person identified in or identifiable from a draft report may bring the matter before the High Court seeking an order from the court directing that the draft be amended before submission to the relevant Minister. The court may either order the commission to submit the report without alteration or with such alterations as it may direct, or give a direction to the commission to provide an opportunity to the person to give evidence or make submissions to the commission before the report is finalised.Either way, no one will be allowed to delay publication indefinitely as there will be time limits for making submissions to the commission or applications to the court. Giving affected persons an opportunity to comment and to have their views considered will meet the requirements of natural justice, and the commitment to fair procedures will reduce the likelihood of court challenges to a commission's work and support the objective of efficient and effective investigations.The final decision on the publication of a report or interim report rests with the relevant Minister. He or she may seek directions from the High Court where there is a risk that anything in the report or interim report could prejudice any pending or ongoing criminal proceedings. This is a useful final check. The Bill does not contemplate any other reason for delaying or withholding publication.Section 39 confers absolute privilege on reports and interim reports as well as on other documentation of a commission, wherever published. It is likely that, in many cases, commissions will find themselves grappling with the difficulties of disputed evidence. As a result, it may transpire that, in some instances, a commission may be unable to establish or present the full facts in respect of some or all of the matters about which it has carried out an investigation. The Bill, therefore, leaves open the possibility of a tribunal of inquiry being established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 for the purposes of inquiring further into the matter. It is my view that it will be the exception to have to establish a tribunal as a follow-up to a commission. Neither will the establishment of a tribunal in such circumstances represent a failure on the part of the commission. On the contrary, it will have carried out invaluable preparatory work on behalf of any subsequent tribunal, thus saving time and cost apart from the quality and volume of the evidence it will have amassed.Section 42 provides that, in the event of a tribunal being established, all of that evidence becomes evidence of the tribunal. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that information excluded from a commission's report under section 31(3) is not made public as a result of the transfer of the evidence received to the subsequent tribunal. Section 43 provides a mechanism for dealing with such information. It provides that the affected person is to be informed of any intention to disclose details that were previously excluded and that they have a right to make observations. Ultimately, the High Court may be asked to decide on the matter.On the wider point of what a tribunal can be expected to achieve that the commission has been unable to do, I suggest I have already answered that. A commission is required to establish facts and may comment beyond that only to the limited extent that I have referred to earlier. This limited brief is required if we are to have a mechanism that reduces the adversarial content of existing fora and places less reliance on cross-examinations and other features that add to cost and delay. A tribunal hears arguments in public and, unlike what we generally expect to be the case with commissions, permits cross-examination. It can then come to conclusions based on the balance of the evidence available to it. In other words, it is able to make judgements about the balance of evidence in a way that we do not foresee for commissions of investigation.I want to stress to the House that it is frequently sufficient that various people's versions of a particular incident come out because one person's opinion is frequently just as good as another person's, having heard the accounts of the various parties. I think back to the proceedings before this House on one occasion when a committee of investigation did not come to any conclusions but everybody was able to hear everybody else's account of the same transaction and, at that point, everyone drew their own conclusions and had an overview of the issue.As I have already stated, I would expect that only in the rare case will there be a need to establish a tribunal following the conclusion by a commission of its work. A decision on whether to propose the establishment of a tribunal will, in the first instance, be a decision by the Government of the day and the proposal must then be submitted to the Oireachtas for its approval. It may be that the Government would decide that, even where the commission's investigation is not as complete as would have been hoped, enough evidence will have been collected for the Government to proceed to deal with the matter in another way, for example, by legislative or administrative action, to remedy the situation which arises on the material available.This reforming legislation provides an efficient and effective alternative to the State for the purposes of investigating matters of significant public concern. It draws on our experience to date with other methods of investigation. It is a Bill that arises from recognition of the complexities of modern government and public administration. The opportunities for systems to fail are ever greater and the consequences of such failures are often far-reaching both for individuals concerned as well as society at large. It is important that we provide ourselves with a mechanism for responding to such failures that is responsive, sensitive and fair while at the same time is effective and efficient. To meet those criteria, it must be speedy and cost-effective. In that way it will command public respect and confidence and will be seen as the ideal way of dealing with complex situations while fully respecting fair procedures and natural justice.I believe this Bill meets those criteria and am therefore happy to commend it to the House. I look forward to a reasoned debate on the various Stages of the consideration of this legislation. I undertake that, as in everything else, I will be alert to sensible and constructive criticism offered in regard to how the Bill can be improved and hope to achieve an even better Act than the Bill I present to the House today.

I may take him up on it.This is a topical Bill, dealing as it does with a new statutory mechanism to establish the factual position about a matter giving rise to significant public concern. It is topical because of the major focus of attention on the tribunals in Dublin Castle. I suppose it is fair to say that public inquiries of different kinds have multiplied and mutated in recent years. We are speaking now of a process which can be regarded, as has been mentioned by the Minister, either as a precursor or an alternative to tribunals. He said there may be a multitude of circumstances in which a commission may operate, including the child sex abuse scandals. I draw from that the first point I want to make, which is that the commissions of investigation proposal fits into the tribunal family. It is a new arrival but is part of the tribunal family and must be considered in that context.The tribunal and public inquiry system is critical to the functioning of a democratic state. The core principles of an investigation are simple; it must be effective, efficient and have the full confidence of the public. Despite much excellent work by the current tribunals, there is clear evidence that the public is suffering from a severe dose of "tribunalitis", with major concerns about the format, cost and enormous time involved in producing results. Any new proposal, therefore, and this one in particular, will be judged by members of the public from three distinct perspectives: speed, cost and results. Any proposed model which fails to make significant improvements on these fronts will not bring about sufficient change. A new approach which may bring speedy results at a reasonable cost is, in principle, worthy of support. For that reason I will not be opposing the Second Reading. This is a new proposal worth considering.Having indicated a broad support for the new approach, I have major concerns about the Bill. I am particularly concerned about what I see as the sidelining of the Oireachtas under the new system. I am also concerned that while there has been a new approach in regard to costs, it does not adequately tackle this issue. I do not think producing estimates is enough. I will come to that later, but essentially I believe we will have to endorse some system of competitive tendering for legal and other services so far as tribunals of inquiry are concerned. There are a number of other reservations that I will come to later.The consultation paper of the Law Reform Commission addressed the whole question of public inquiries and tribunals and recommended that: "Legislation be enacted providing for a private low-key inquiry which focuses on malfunction of the system and not the wrong-doer." To some degree this Bill gives effect to that recommendation. That does not, of course, take from the need to deal with many of the other recommendations of that report. In particular it does not take from the need to reform and update the tribunal of inquiry legislation dating back to 1921.I come back to my major reservation about this Bill, the sidelining of the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas seems to have no role except in producing a positive resolution to establish a commission. In every other respect the powers of the Minister are paramount and are exercised without reference to the Oireachtas. This is in total contrast to the position in the tribunals of inquiry legislation. Some of the powers which the Minister has taken from the Oireachtas and conferred on himself include: the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, who will establish the commission by making an order, will have overall responsibility for the workings of the commission; it is the Minister who will set the terms of reference; the costs and timeframe are to be determined by the Minister; the Minister can amend the terms of reference without reference or recourse to the Oireachtas; the members of the commission are appointed by the Minister; the reports, whether in draft, interim or final form, must all be submitted to the Minister; it is the Minister who publishes the reports; and the Government has the power to terminate a commission.These are some of the powers through which the Minister of the day can be the political master of a commission of inquiry. It is fair to ask whether the Minister has considered the effect this will have on public confidence in a process of this nature. That is my major question mark on the Bill. I contrast it to some degree with, say, the recent Hutton inquiry in the UK. By special dispensation the Prime Minister only got a copy of the report 24 hours before he had to deal with questions about it in Parliament. This was for the sole purpose of enabling him to answer questions in Parliament.

I want to go back to the question of the powers of the Minister as opposed to the Oireachtas. As someone who has been in this Parliament for quite a while — as indeed the Minister has — I am concerned at what effectively amounts to the sidelining of the Oireachtas. The Order establishing the commission may authorise the Minister to set the terms of reference. He or she may do so without reference to Parliament and, leaving Hutton aside, this is in stark contrast to the position under the tribunals of inquiry Act. It is different but it is one of the tribunals' family.Under section 31 it is the Minister who receives the report. Under sections 32 and 33, interim and draft reports must also be submitted to the Minister. The independence of a body such as a commission of investigation is paramount. To enjoy public confidence the commissions must be at arm's length from the Government of the day. It is not inconceivable that a good deal of the commission's time may be spent investigating the actions of those not too far removed from the political sphere, if we look at current examples this day. I urge the Minister to take on board the need for the involvement of the Oireachtas as the buffer between the Executive and the commission. That is the way to secure the confidence of the public. Not alone must the commission be independent, but it must be seen to be independent. I am not pointing the finger at anybody who may be appointed. I am sure they will be fine people. However, the process must be seen to be independent of the Executive.In responding to the Minister's point at the end of his Second Stage speech, I want him to look at a process by which the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas is reinstated. I believe that commissions should be established by the Oireachtas and have their terms of reference set or agreed by the Houses. In addition, the chairman of each commission should be answerable to the Houses or to a committee of the Oireachtas on the process of inquiry on which he or she is engaged. In the broader context and looking at tribunals generally, I like the idea of the chairman of a commission or tribunal meeting and reporting to a committee of the Oireachtas to answer questions on the process. Obviously, he or she would not answer questions on the content or detail of the investigation, but on the process. Such a report should be made every three or six months.I accept that to have an estimate of the costs of a commission represents an important step forward. We must go further, however. In The Sunday Business Post last Sunday we saw a headline to the effect that lawyers had received over €100 million in fees to date from tribunals. Let us stop giving out and do something about it. Perhaps it is the countryman’s approach, but to me, if the OPW wants to build a cowhouse it has to get three or four tender prices before it can give out a contract. Yet millions are being spent on lawyers and other services for tribunals. One takes one’s pick and pays later. Why do we not have a competitive tendering process for legal and other services for all commissions and tribunals? There is one other aspect of costs the Minister should consider. He has failed to address the awarding of costs to persons who delay or obstruct commissions of inquiry. Under the Bill, as drafted, particularly section 23, there is no expressed impediment to such persons being awarded their costs.This Bill is predicated on the idea that it will be cheaper and faster than a tribunal. I emphasise the need for public support and confidence in the new system. One other danger should be pointed out — it was touched on last week in The Economist, which referred to comments by a barrister, Jeffrey Jowell, who teaches at University College London, under an article entitled “Judge not lest ye be judged”. He believes political controversies can be neutered by handing them to someone who seems to embody a dispassionate inquiry. That is another reason for the intervention of the Oireachtas, as opposed to the Government of the day, kicking something to touch, getting it out of sight and out of mind.

I fell victim to that in my early days in this House, but I would be slow to do so now. We must be careful when establishing commissions or tribunals of inquiry and their terms of reference. We have contributed to the demand for inquiries and that is why it is our responsibility to find a better way.The Bill is predicated on the idea that a commission will be cheaper and faster than a tribunal, providing a forum for private and efficient investigations. In its consultation paper, the Law Reform Commission recommends the enactment of legislation to this effect and this Bill goes some way along those lines. The commission did say, however, that it would expect that such an inquiry would not attract the rules of constitutional justice. The Minister seems to have taken that on board but there are some questions.

He is walking a constitutional tightrope. He wants to establish private inquiries without lawyers or publicity but there are constitutional constraints. We must ask if the Bill strikes the right balance. Article 40.3.2° of the Constitution grants each person the right to a good name and the protection of this right before the courts necessitates the right of representation, particularly where one's good name may be called into question. As the tribunal system and the proposed commission system is, despite the best efforts of the Minister, somewhat adversarial in nature, questions are asked and answers given that often attribute responsibility to someone else. If, in a private hearing, a person is not aware of the adverse comments through a denial of representation, are his or her constitutional rights being violated? We must consider these issues now before the Bill is enacted.The right to one's good name and the right to representation are so strong that any effort to restrain these rights, as the Bill proposes, raises the possibility of legal challenge. The Supreme Court highlighted the entitlement of a witness to cross-examine in the Jock Haughey case. In a more recent High Court case involving Dr. Kirrane and the Finlay tribunal, the court quashed much of the tribunal's report that connected Dr. Kirrane with the contamination of blood products. This order was made on the basis of natural justice and that his rights had been breached by the tribunal as he had not been afforded the right to representation, to cross-examine or to make submissions.The Bill provides in certain circumstances for rights of attendance, representation and cross-examination. Has it done enough to avoid any potential infringement of constitutional rights? On the other hand, the workings of the commission seem, in certain circumstances, to veer towards the procedures that would be expected in a tribunal or a court. As we read the Bill, the distinction between a commission and a tribunal fades. Has the requirement of natural justice defeated the intention to have low-key, private, low-cost hearings? Has the Minister achieved his aim of private, swift inquiries without lawyers and without being bound to the rules of constitutional justice as suggested by the Law Reform Commission? If not we are simply adding another layer to the tribunal process which will be as costly and lengthy as what has gone before.I raise these issues because that is the job of an Opposition that is genuinely trying to assist in the formulation of a better product. If we look at cost and efficiency, the public nature and consequent number of lawyers are the two ingredients which have made tribunals lengthy and costly. This legislation does not prevent these two factors from becoming an issue in commissions. Section 10 indicates that the bulk of a commission's work is to be undertaken in private. Under sections 10(1)(a) and (b), however, the commission must sit in public where a witness requests so or where fair procedures would require it to sit in public. These circumstances are potentially broad and reintroduce the public element to commissions.Section 10(2) reintroduces the potential for the attendance of large and costly legal teams because it allows legal representatives of persons other than witnesses to attend. Sections 10(2)(c) and (d) introduce the right to cross-examine the workings of a commission. Again, we are veering into tribunal country with all the attendant costs.Section 6(2) gives rise to concern. It states that the terms of reference cannot be amended where to do so would prejudice the rights of any person who has co-operated or provided information to it. That seems fair enough at first but it effectively grants immunity from further investigation of those who begin by assisting the tribunal irrespective of what negative details of their role become available later. Is it wise to tie the hands of the commission in this unusual way?Section 9(2)(b) is another unusual provision. It imposes a mandatory obligation on a commission of investigation to seek the voluntary co-operation of persons whose evidence is desired and the commission must facilitate such co-operation. This section is good in theory but unduly onerous for the commission. How far does it go? Would the commission have to travel overseas to facilitate witnesses?I give qualified support to the Bill. There must be a better way to go about these things than the current system. It may be that this Bill goes part of the way to addressing that but I want answers to the serious questions I have raised. At this stage we cannot ignore the current criticisms of the format and the endless time the tribunals take. The raft of tribunals of inquiry legislation stretches back to 1921 and it is time to reform it. The Law Reform Commission report in March 2003 was comprehensive on this issue. Does the Government have any intention of implementing that report or introducing new legislation? A review of the tribunals of inquiry legislation is long overdue. Last week at the Moriarty tribunal, Dermot Desmond, a respectable and responsible citizen, reflected the view of the majority of the public when he said that the tribunals have lost the plot. They are going from pillar to post without any end in sight. We must take that on board.I do not blame the tribunals. We set them up and gave them their terms of reference. We underestimated the job we gave them and it is our responsibility to address the consequences of our own actions, seriously engage in a review process and introduce legislation to reform the tribunals of inquiry legislation. The consultation paper issued by the Law Reform Commission was 340 pages long. However, only five pages dealt with alternatives to tribunals, the rest concerned tribunals themselves.This important legislation was published last July. Why has it taken nine months to bring it before the House? Remarks from the Minister earlier this year seemed to imply that the Opposition was holding up the Bill. As the Minister is aware, it is the Government that controls the business of this House, and when this Bill was launched——

When this Bill was circulated, on behalf of Fine Gael I committed the party to approaching it in a constructive fashion. However, I could not do so, since it took nine months to bring it into the House. Be that as it may, I intend to continue in that spirit, and on that basis I will not oppose Second Stage. However, some of the issues that I have raised are serious and should be addressed. I am usually concerned, not just as a member of the Opposition but as a long-term parliamentarian in this House, at the way in which the Oireachtas has been sidelined. I genuinely believe it to be the wrong approach — it is not the way to deal with this business. The Minister should from now on consider the amendments which he will table on Committee Stage to improve the Bill, and I will do likewise.

The slowest one is that with which we were dealing the other day, the Private Security Services Bill 2001, which has been loping through the House at a meandering pace for three years and a month.This Bill came even before that, since, when the Minister was elected and became a member of the Government as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one of his first public pronouncements was that he intended to do something about the cost of tribunals and streamlining their conduct. As early as October 2002, he said that he would put in place some measure along the lines of a commission of investigations. He drew up a scheme in December 2002 and that was very much tied up with the "Cardinal Secrets" programme on RTE in which it appeared that there had been serious sexual abuse of minors, that those matters had not been brought to the attention of the Garda and that an investigation was required. As a result, the Minister said that he would introduce a new type of investigation that would cover that area in the archdiocese of Dublin but would be flexible enough to cover the rest of the country too.That was one of the determining criteria which fed into the approach taken in the Bill. The legislation came in July 2003 and we have had to wait until now to deal with it. The impression has been presented to the media that the Opposition was obstructive and that if we had only co-operated, this Bill would have been enacted and implemented long ago. That is not good enough since both main Opposition parties have gone on record to say that they would very much facilitate such legislation because they thought that it would be very worthwhile. The Labour Party supports the thrust of the Minister's proposal. We would, of course, go much further with this legislation, but we welcome it.All of us are aware of two constant and competing features of modern-day public life in Ireland. The first is the widespread recognition of the need to secure accountability from those in positions of power, whether in political life, business, finance, the church or the media. The second is the need to control the enormous legal costs that seem inevitably to arise whenever accountability is demanded in a public forum.Today's Bill is an attempt to provide for an alternative to the full-blown tribunals of inquiry that have become an almost permanent feature of the landscape. The work they do is important and must be permitted to proceed, but the expense is unconscionable. When serious choices face us daily as to how public money should be spent, the creation of yet more tribunal millionaires at public expense strikes many citizens as an unattractive, if not downright repulsive, prospect. Unless it gets its act together, the legal profession faces the real risk that, by its own unstinting avarice, it will succeed in killing the goose that laid so many golden eggs for so many of its senior members.Our party has made it clear that we are willing to examine constructively any proposals from the Government to protect taxpayers' money. That said, however, I stress some very important points. First, I reiterate that we would not be prepared to agree to proposals that would leave uninvestigated serious allegations of wrongdoing already in the public domain or in the possession of the tribunals. Second, I have no doubt that the complaints about expense and delay that feature so prominently in discussions about tribunals are orchestrated by those who have most to lose from the tribunals doing their job effectively and efficiently — in other words, from those with an interest in the truth remaining unrevealed and in discrediting the means by which they are being called upon to answer to the public.Third, the merit of the tribunals' work is not measured simply on a profit-and-loss basis. It is not simply a question of working out how many otherwise undiscovered bank accounts and offshore stashes have come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, although those calculations are worthwhile. The recent reorganisation and revitalisation of the Revenue Commissioners would not have occurred unless its workings had been placed under the spotlight of focused public scrutiny, both in Dublin Castle and in front of the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts during the DIRT inquiry.All our public institutions are engaged in an ongoing process, some faster than others, of institutional reform precisely because they know that old, lackadaisical ways are no longer sufficient, that questions can no longer be shelved and remain unanswered, and that historic decisions must be justified. The Labour Party, I am proud to say, led the way both in opposition and in government in securing major structural changes in the way this country is governed. The attitude to public life summarised in our demand for openness, transparency and accountability led to the passing of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and the Electoral Act 1997, which set out new and comprehensive rules for the funding of political life. The subsequent attempts at the evisceration of both the freedom of information and political funding regimes demonstrate just how seriously the Government objects to notions such as transparency and accountability. It hankers for old and discredited ways, but it will not succeed.Fourth, it is important to point out that the investigation commissions proposed by the Minister today can only be an alternative but never a substitute for tribunals of inquiry, and I do not believe that the Minister makes that claim. The Bill recognises in section 41 that a report from a commission might in turn lead to the subsequent establishment of a full tribunal of inquiry of the type we have seen over recent years. However, at least the commission would have broken the back of the potential workload, and the tribunal could hit the ground running.There are several reasons tribunals might still prove necessary, depending on the subject matter of an inquiry. Not least among those is that, following the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality, the Constitution now specifically recognises the special status of a tribunal of inquiry appointed by the Government or a Minister "on the authority of both Houses of the Oireachtas". I will return to that point. A commission of investigation appointed under this Bill would not be such a tribunal and would not enjoy the powers exclusively reserved to such a tribunal — to inquire into decision-making and discussions at a Government meeting.The other reasons have to do with the limited status that a commission would have vis-à-vis a tribunal of inquiry. Precisely because it attempts, as much as possible, to be a lawyer-free zone, a more relaxed attitude is taken in this Bill to the rules of natural justice that were spelt out so comprehensively, if not dogmatically, by the Supreme Court in the Haughey case to which Deputy Jim O’Keeffe referred. However, that relaxed approach to investigation has an impact on the nature and potential content of any report that could be published by a commission.The primary function of a commission will be to establish the facts of a matter.As the explanatory memorandum points out, "Reports will set out the facts that have been established" but "it is not the function of a Commission to adjudicate where there is a conflict or incomplete evidence." Fact finding, therefore, if a conflict of evidence arises, will be outside the remit of a commission of investigation. This is presumably because the testing of conflicting accounts must involve due notice to the individuals likely to be adversely affected and the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, all areas where it is simply impossible to exclude legal participation.The Bill provides that a commission may draw attention to situations where there is a clear balance in the evidence in support of a certain set of facts. Section 31(2), the seminal section in the legislation, states:(2) If for any reason (including insufficient, conflicting or inconsistent evidence) a commission considers that the facts relating to a particular issue have not been established, the commission in its report—(a) shall identify the issue, and(b) may indicate its opinion as to the quality and weight of any evidence relating to the issue.This is probably as far as the Minister believes and is advised he can go in the absence of formal natural justice safeguards. Is it not, in fact, a step too far? I would welcome more detail from the Minister about the thinking behind the drafting of that section.On the one hand, an indication of the commissioner's opinion as to the quality and weight of evidence relating to a disputed fact is presumably intended to be something less than an explicit finding of fact, which could be made only if Haughey-style procedures and proceedings were involved. If so, the commissioner's opinion will not satisfy those who sought an inquiry on a matter of controversy precisely because they wanted the facts to be definitively ascertained. On the other hand, what is any report from an official source except the opinion of the author as to the quality and weight of the relevant evidence? What is a High Court judgment except an expression of opinion, binding on the parties to that case but, as far as findings of fact are concerned, of no binding significance to the rest of us?In the Abbeylara case, the Supreme Court placed great significance on what it described as the "adjudicative" function that would have been performed by a committee of this House if it had continued in its inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. John Carty. An adjudication is, apparently, something less than a court determination but something more than an informal expression of opinion. However, according to those judgments, an opinion acquires the status of an adjudication because it emanates from an official, lawfully established source. To put it starkly, the media, for example, have opinions but Oireachtas committees, because they are organs of the State and exercise statutory powers, make adjudications. Adjudications liable to affect adversely the reputation or other rights of an individual cannot be made except in compliance with elaborate procedural safeguards, precisely the elaborate procedures the Minister is hoping to avoid in this Bill.How can a commissioner be given the power under statute to express an opinion, following an inquiry conducted using powers of compulsion, if the usually prescribed safeguards that surround such inquiries are absent in this case? The Minister will agree that section 31(2) will create jurisprudence. He and his advisers must have thought long and hard about it and it is important that he share his thinking as to the viability of this proposal.It is useful to have a commission option of the type proposed in this Bill available for use, but whether a commission or a more traditional tribunal would be more appropriate would have to be determined by the circumstances of the matter to be investigated. In this regard, it is disappointing that the Government appears to have abandoned the option of investigation by an Oireachtas committee where this would be appropriate. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred at length to this. The DIRT inquiry completed its public hearings within six weeks and recouped almost €500 million for the Exchequer. It acquired widespread public support because it involved politicians doing what they are elected to do, holding people accountable in the public interest.However, not only has the Government not taken action in this area, it has reneged on the commitment it made to implement the key recommendations contained in the DIRT report on the introduction of legislation to provide for the appointment of parliamentary inspectors.

It might have restricted, as this Bill does, the areas in which they could operate. I am a member of the sub-committee which is compiling a report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. There are many such useful roles for the various committees and sub-committees of the Oireachtas. Abbeylara was a unique case and it is cited too often in this context. That case involved a homicide or killing and it is not the type of model we should use when considering the uses of the committees and sub-committees of the House and the manner in which they should operate.It had been envisaged in the recommendations that a parliamentary inspector could be appointed to inquire privately into matters of public concern as a preliminary to a possible Oireachtas inquiry, as was the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the DIRT inquiry. On foot of the inspector's report, it would be up to the Oireachtas to decide whether to proceed with a public inquiry or to establish an independent tribunal of inquiry. If the Government is serious about establishing a procedure for inquiring into matters of public interest without costing the Exchequer an inordinate amount of money, it is inexplicable that it has not only not dealt with the issues arising from the Abbeylara judgment but has abandoned the commitment to the parliamentary inspector.This Bill is significant but disappointing. It marks the rejection by the Government of any serious role for the Oireachtas and its committees in ensuring public accountability. That is probably the most disappointing aspect of it. Commissions of investigation, rather than being appointed by and answerable to this House will, under the Minister's proposals, be creatures of the Government.I do not believe the Government has a realisation of the scale of the task facing this House when it confronts the need to radically reform the way it does its business. The Labour Party published a comprehensive policy document on this in October last year. It will be clear to anybody who has read the document that we put a great deal of research and work into it.Dáil reform is about securing one important objective. It is not simply a Labour Party objective but a constitutional imperative. The Government is responsible to this House. For a Government to be formed and survive, it must secure and maintain the confidence of the House. The only test by which a proposal for reform must be judged is whether it assists this House in securing Government accountability. The task of parliamentarians is often described as being "to legislate". The late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, in a ruling in the course of the beef tribunal, put it differently. He said:... it is, inter alia, the duty of the members of the Oireachtas to elect a Government, to legislate and to look diligently into every affair of Government. It is meant to be the eyes and the voice and to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents and to inform and be informed by them.He also famously commented during the beef tribunal: "I think that if the questions that were asked in the Dáil were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no necessity for this inquiry and an awful lot of money and time would have been saved." Members on this side of the House entirely agree.

We cannot be benchmarked by reference to the number of Bills we have processed by the end of the year. If that was the only criterion, then the Dáil, sitting two-and-a-half days a week for fewer weeks in the year, would have far higher productivity than the House of Commons, which has a five-day week and far shorter holidays.The history of the last century, in terms of public administration, has been one of massive expansion in the role of the State, through its executive, through the raft of public bodies that operate under the general aegis of the executive and through other bodies which operate entirely independent of the executive. It was both natural and right that the courts developed an expanded role in reaction to this phenomenon, primarily and particularly since the 1970s, through the process of judicial review.Inevitably, the growth in executive competence and action, coupled with the increased vigilance of the courts in policing the lawfulness of public administration, has led to a generally perceived decline in the relevance of the third branch of Government, the national Parliament.Apart from retaining a formal role in electing the Government and in assenting to Government proposals for legislation, the two Houses of the Oireachtas are in genuine danger of being relegated to the status of a reasonably well paid and well staffed talking shop, whose members sound off on the various issues of the day, without any real input into either the formulation of public policy or the scrutiny of its execution.In our democracy, in addition to making law, the Dáil identifies who should form the Government of the day. Part of the job of Opposition is to establish that better alternatives exist. The Dáil must seek to ensure that the Government is accountable to the people. It must provide a public platform for discussion and the investigation of major issues. It must approve the raising of taxes and the way in which that money is spent. It must watch, appraise and criticise the activities of the Government and of the public service. It must provide a forum for individuals to raise issues and grievances indirectly through its Members. All of these are essential functions. Quite separately, Deputies have a representative role vis-à-vis their constituents on a daily basis, a role insisted on by constituents and neglected at our peril.

Our work is so much wider than that narrow circumscribed role. In that context I would like to see the role of this House and its committees expanded. The Labour Party says that, if the Dáil is to be a powerhouse of accountability, a true representative of the interests of the people, a place where maladministration leading to injustice can be investigated and rooted out, it must be modern, efficient, dynamic and powerful. It must be adversarial and tough, but fair and thorough as well.Among the measures to which we are committed is a major role for the Dáil in carrying out public inquiries. As a result of the Supreme Court judgments arising from the Abbeylara case, and the knock-on effects of those judgments for the mini-CTC inquiry, it is clear that if parliamentary inquiries are to be effective, constitutional change is probably necessary.We therefore propose a constitutional amendment to confer a clear mandate on the Dáil to "inquire into and report upon any exercise of the executive power of the State or in relation to the administration of any of its public services."We also propose the establishment of a powerful new Oireachtas committee of investigations, oversight and petitions which would be bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a member of the Opposition. The role of that committee would be: to ensure consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and the ombudsman; to receive parliamentary petitions from interested groups in the community seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services and with public administration generally; to arrange investigation of issues of urgent public importance which demand detailed and thorough investigation, of the sort that normally only a tribunal can satisfactorily deal with; and to supervise an office of parliamentary investigator.The office of parliamentary investigator which we propose would be designed to ensure timely and cost-effective investigation of issues giving rise to significant public concern. Persons would be appointed from time to time to this office, on the basis of specific contracts, to carry out specific investigations. They would perform functions similar to those carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General and would have powers to secure attendance, to direct answers to questions, to direct the disclosure and production of documents, to secure evidence and to make determinations where privilege is claimed over information or documents. In general, they would take evidence in private, without legal and other representation by other parties, and would prepare written reports on matters of established fact, which could be used as the basis for further investigation, including tribunals.On the other hand, such an inspection could not arrive at conclusions on disputed issues of fact. As the Minister has provided in this Bill, on the conclusion of an investigation, the investigator would prepare a written report, based on the evidence received, setting out the facts established in regard to the matters referred for investigation. In other words, the function of an investigator would be to undertake the preliminary investigation — the Minister reflects this in the Bill but it would also be done by the Houses — and, so far as possible, establish the factual position. In many circumstances, that would be sufficient. Where the investigator was unable to establish clear facts, however, his or her report would, if necessary, be followed by either a formal parliamentary inquiry or a tribunal of inquiry, as appropriate. In those situations, the evidence collected by the investigator would be available to the committee or tribunal, thereby reducing time and cost. The inquiry would, as I said earlier, hit the ground running.Consideration of reports of the parliamentary investigator, making recommendations as to whether a further inquiry was required, the choice between Oireachtas or judicial inquiry, drawing up terms of reference for such inquiries, maintenance of liaison with the inquiry as it proceeded, including receiving and considering reports from the inquiry as to its progress, co-operation given and any delays encountered, would all be functions of the investigations, oversight and petitions committee.One might think there is no necessary conflict between the role proposed for a parliamentary investigator and that of the ad hoc commissions of investigation proposed here. However, the essential but crucial difference is that the Minister envisages an inquiry process initiated by the Government, with terms of reference drafted by the Government and whose work would be controlled and funded by the Government, subject always to Department of Finance approval. That is hugely different. While we go along with the thrust of what the Minister says, there is, nevertheless, a vast difference between the type of proposal which would involve the Houses of the Oireachtas and the committees of the House, and the proposals which would be subject to the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance and the Government.There is no reason Ministers should not have power to appoint inquiries in respect of matters falling under their responsibility. However, neither is it realistic to expect that inquires under that degree of ministerial control, the work of which will be conducted almost entirely in private, would of themselves be adequate to meet serious public concerns relating to public administration. Deputy O'Keeffe also reflected this view.The Members of this House are entitled to reject unthinking criticism that would treat the Dáil as a Bills factory and the work of a Deputy as a nine-to-five job. Equally we must accept that change is necessary to do as well as possible the complex job to which Deputies are elected. If this is to be achieved, Dáil Éireann must be a place to which people can turn with confidence when normal accountability is needed, when legitimate grievance needs to be aired, when issues arising from public administration of concern to the public need to be investigated and when vital legislation needs to be seriously and thoroughly addressed.It remains to be seen to what extent the Commissions of Investigation Bill will meet the objectives of cutting legal costs and providing an effective vehicle for investigating allegations of wrongdoing. Certainly under the proposed new procedure legal participation would be minimised but not entirely excluded. This is quite appropriate because fair procedures, as constitutionally guaranteed, must be observed, even in private proceedings.Our insistence — we will table amendments in an attempt to secure this — is that securing accountability is a parliamentary rather than an executive function. The relationship between Government and Parliament in this State is dysfunctional. If not amended this Bill will be bizarre in that it will merely further concentrate power within Government with regard to the control of an important initiative which is ostensibly designed to secure Government accountability.

Sin scéal eile, áfach.Beidh mé ar lorg freagraí ar an bhealach a oibreoidh an coimisiún ó thaobh fianaise as Gaeilge agus Béarla. Glacaim go mbeidh sé ar nós na cúirteanna agus gur féidir cearta a chosaint as ceachtar den teangacha. Ba mhaith liom sin a chinntiú.Cuireann An Comhaontas Glas fáilte chosanta roimh an mBille agus tá súil againn go leasófar agus feabhsófar é agus é ag dul fríd an Oireachtas.Having said that, we give the Bill a guarded welcome. To some extent, it is puzzling why it was published in a fanfare of urgency, prior to the Dáil summer recess, yet we are only addressing it now. Perhaps other factors and parliamentary considerations have to be taken into account.That said, we have a number of reservations which we hope will be the subject of amendments to the Bill. Apart from the legislation being long overdue, we welcome it. One of my main concerns is that evidence is generally to be received in private. There is a danger that this will impede public access to information to which the public is entitled. It is ironic and somewhat unfortunate for the Government that the publication of the Bill came in the same week it decided to charge the public for freedom of information requests. We are concerned that the Bill is indicative of a culture of telling people as little as possible. I hope this will be balanced with the need for confidentiality. We need assurance that this will be the case. There is understandable concern at the motives behind it.Various inquiries are ongoing and are beginning to be a way of life for many people, especially those in the legal profession. The legislation requires the approval of the Minister for Finance prior to the Government establishing a commission. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to this point in his contribution. It is important to note that previous inquiries, as we are reminded by the Taoiseach any time anything appears to go wrong with them, were set up by the Dáil and, therefore, they have its sanction. The legislation before us appears to depart from this approach, which may become awkward and derail the integrity of the commission, although one would hope this would not be the case. There is a clear danger in putting all one's eggs into the Minister for Finance's basket in terms of approval.While I do not foresee a problem with the present Minister, a future Minister for Finance could well be compromised by his or her involvement in certain activities which it is intended would be examined by a commission of investigation. If that were the case, the Minister would, in effect, have an improper influence over the matter. This aspect needs to be re-examined. While the 166 Members of this House may not be perfect in every way, we are representative, in the widest possible sense, of the people who elected us. The Minister for Finance, who is also representative of a certain number of the electorate, should not have a greater say in the matter of the setting up of a commission of inquiry than any other Member of the Oireachtas.I recall my days as a member of Dublin County Council in the early 1990s when there was a considerable amount of tension in the air, some of which is the subject of lengthy discussion in tribunals, especially the Mahon tribunal. It is conceivable that a member of that local authority could still become Minister for Finance and be in a position where he or she is required to make a decision on a commission of investigation. When I asked in Dublin County Council if anybody other than me had received a cheque from a developer, I was physically taken to task by a member of a Government party, who is a serving Member of the Oireachtas, and who could well go on to become Minister for Finance. Where does that leave a commission of investigation when Members' previous representative roles may be under investigation? Has the Government thought through this matter? It could be unwise to leave the legislation unamended in this regard. The Oireachtas rather than the Minister should have the final say.I welcome the proposals for time limits but fear this may lead to a commission being rushed through without sufficient examination of witnesses. This is a valid concern which is shared by people outside the House. As was previously mentioned, it is unlikely that we would have the Bill before us if inquiries were expeditiously dealt with in a timeframe shorter than is the experience at present. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to the Hutton inquiry. I accept that this inquiry had narrower terms of reference and could not be seen to compare with some of the inquiries which are ongoing in this jurisdiction.We need to look more closely at what brings about a need for inquiries. Although I do not wish to stray from the Bill, the need for Dáil reform is intrinsically linked to the need to examine how inquiries are dealt with. If proper answers were given in the Dáil there may not have been a need for a beef tribunal. In that sense we continue to risk the need for further tribunals when the Taoiseach or any Minister can basically read out whatever brief has been given to him or her, even though it may have little to do with the question being asked. If we leave this flawed parliamentary practice in place, there is a possibility of other tribunals.The tribunals cause considerable annoyance because of the amount of money being earned by certain individuals in the legal profession on an ongoing basis. There is a need to discriminate between somebody who gets a brief for a case that can be dealt with in a short time, thus leaving that person between jobs, and somebody who is working for a tribunal that effectively has a guaranteed run. In comparing the payments in each of these cases, we are not comparing like with like. This must be examined and, if necessary, the subject of legal change.There is a need to examine the role of the Oireachtas. The DIRT inquiry is obviously held up as an example of the effective use of an Oireachtas sub-committee. The Abbeylara controversy could snooker that potential. We need to see if matters can be resolved legally so Oireachtas sub-committees can be further empowered to do the work people want them to do, given that they are in a position to do so without having to buy in as much legal assistance as a commission of investigation might need, or a tribunal of investigation such as that in Dublin Castle. I hope Committee Stage of the Bill will be fruitful and that the changes can be taken on board.

More particularly, they need to know how to prevent a similar episode happening in future. In such cases, public inquiries are in the public interest. The main objective of this Bill is to reduce the duration and cost of public inquiries in general and tribunals specifically. The Law Reform Commission's report lists all the inquiries and tribunals. There have been 29 major tribunals since the foundation of the State, four of which are ongoing: the Moriarty, Mahon, Morris and Barr tribunals.This Bill provides for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of a new mechanism for investigation into matters of urgent public concern by way of commissions of investigation which may act as an alternative or precursor to a tribunal of inquiry. It is anticipated that these will help reduce the costs of such inquiries because there will be an emphasis on taking evidence voluntarily, in private if necessary, and in most cases without legal representation. The evidence to these commissions would be inadmissible in criminal or other proceedings but preliminary investigation work completed by a commission should reduce the duration and cost of any subsequent tribunal. This is to be welcomed.A year ago the Law Reform Commission published its recommendations on public tribunals of inquiry and all the alternatives. It supported the formula which is to be found in this Bill. I look forward to going through the Bill in detail on Committee Stage, particularly Part 2, sections 3 and 4, which concern the establishment and membership of commissions, and Part 5, which concerns the powers of the commission to report back to the House. More work needs to be done on these Parts of the Bill.There is a need for commissions to report to the House and not just to the Minister, given that the Houses would establish them. If amendments are required to the terms of reference, these should be referred back to the House. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated that, if we continue to delegate investigatory functions to powers outside the House, accountability to the House will wane. At the very least, we should ensure that commissions report back to the House, not just to the Minister, and that the House has a role in setting the terms of reference, costs and other matters referred to in the Bill but in respect of which the Minister appears to have the final say.Sinn Féin broadly welcomes this Bill. It probably represents the most constructive contribution of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since taking office. If he spent more time doing this kind of work and less time on his war against immigrants and republicans and on trying to undermine a rights-based society, we might make some progress.I particularly welcome the strong powers of compulsion in the proposed commissions of inquiry. However, I have questions on this that the Minister of State might be able to address, one of which relates to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. It produced a major report with many recommendations, some of which were proposed amendments to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act. When we had a debate recently on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill 2003, which was dealt with only a few weeks ago, those recommendations were not addressed. Will they be taken on board?What about the points in the commission's report on parliamentary inquiries which were referred to by other Deputies? Can we have a discussion on whether there is a need to have legislation to assist in this regard? Do we require a constitutional amendment to address the problem that arose in the Abbeylara case in the High Court?While the costs of tribunals have been frequently complained of since the beef tribunal, we need to maintain a balance. The ongoing Morris and Barr tribunals have helped to focus the public mind on the need for Garda reform, for instance, and for a Garda ombudsman. There should be no attempt to under-value the role of tribunals. Other tribunals have exposed corruption by establishing parties that have wilfully hidden their activities from the public view. They have had and continue to have a corrosive effect on politics in this State. We should not lose sight of the fact that measures that effectively serve the public interest represent value for money, even if they are costly. Therefore, we should continue to have public inquiries when required. Having said this, we welcome the reasonable measures to control costs of tribunals where they do not sacrifice constitutional rights and the public interest. Specifically, we recognise the need to address the spiralling cost of legal fees and look forward to the full implementation of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.We agree with the commission that, where criminality is suspected, a greater attempt should be made to instigate criminal proceedings rather than hoping that the same objectives can be achieved under the guise of an inquiry. This would constitute a misuse or an abuse of that mechanism. It is certain, however, that there must be no new provision in this legislation that undermines the public's right to know or undermines Government transparency and accountability. The truth must come out and justice must be done. Changes in legislation, policy and practice must follow to ensure there is no repeat of past wrongs or mistakes. This means tribunals and commissions of investigation are not sufficient in and of themselves. Political will is also necessary to make changes.British state collusion with loyalist paramilitaries and direct operations by British forces claimed the lives of at least 47 people in this State between 1972 and 1994 and Sinn Féin supports the families and those who have lost relatives as a result of State collusion, and who demand the truth. This should possibly take the form of a full public tribunal of inquiry covering this State, the North and Britain. We have consistently supported them without exception and will continue to do so.Last year we started a debate with the publication of a consultation document about truth recovery processes. To date we are the only party to have done so. That is a pity and I hope others will engage in this debate and produce their own documents. Our document is on our website if anyone is interested. These processes of truth recovery need to be victim and survivor based. We call for full public disclosure from the British and Irish Governments on all these cases, without exception, to ensure truth and justice for the victims and the survivors of the bereaved who have their own newsletters, one of which is entitled Collusion. They have set up a group. This legislation must not be misused to obstruct these families in their search for truth, in which they deserve the unstinting support of every Member of this House. I welcome the Bill and hope that by the time it has gone through Committee and Report Stages, the concerns that I and other Deputies have raised will be addressed.

Many people will be relieved to hear that the Government is attempting to deal with the issue of expensive and time-consuming tribunals of inquiry. While most recognise the valuable and important work of the tribunals there is no doubt that a type of tribunal fatigue has set in. Despite the disturbing revelations still emerging from the tribunals there is an overall sense of impatience and exasperation with the process. This is a pity because it can overshadow the work of the tribunals. We must ensure that this does not happen.There can be no escape for those who belonged to a culture where money could buy anything, decisions were taken in the interest of private individuals and certain politicians ruled their patches like personal fiefdoms. They behaved like the lords of the manor who dispensed favours and granted wishes in exchange for large sums of money. I, like many people, am concerned that the lengthy nature of the tribunals and their exorbitant cost will act as a cover for those who are guilty, who will use and abuse the system to stall, filibuster and delay, to do whatever it takes to get them off the hook. Many Members of this House were Members then too. I was a member of the public with no involvement in politics and had no clue to what was happening. Only recently have I become aware of the fall-out from matters under investigation. I am anxious that no legislation passed in this House is used to ensure that certain issues under investigation would or could be left in abeyance or side-lined.The tribunals are investigating the underbelly of Irish life and that process must not be halted. That is not revenge, it is accountability and an attempt to build a society whose public matters are transparent and honest. It can set a benchmark for public institutions now engaged in the reform necessary to deliver that accountability and transparency. I have been in this House for less than two years and one of my greatest disappointments of that tenure was the passing of the amendment to the Freedom of Information Act which in many ways neutered a system that might have ensured less need for tribunals or commissions of inquiry or investigation. While I broadly welcome the thrust of this legislation, I am deeply concerned that we have amended legislation that would have ensured a much more transparent system for managing our public business.If Ministers were prepared to answer Dáil questions with the intention of providing information our public systems would be much improved. Perhaps it is naive of a first-time Deputy to expect this but at times the obfuscation and hindrance to the flow of information, and the double speak have been a surprise and a disappointment to me. With this legislation we can make real progress towards establishing a mechanism for a more timely and cost-effective investigation of issues that would give rise to significant public concern.The tribunals have been very valuable in exposing the existence of dubious practices in the planning sector and elsewhere. They are taking far too long to reach their conclusions and are lining the pockets of certain lawyers. The public is horrified at these costs. Despite the examples of good practice abroad we seem to have devised methods of investigation designed to take as long as possible rather than expedite matters and reach conclusions in a timely fashion. We need a new system which will produce the outcomes necessary upon which to base legal action against lawbreakers while protecting the innocent from slander and long exposure. The tribunals seem to have weekly rehearsals in the Sunday papers, with occasional obvious leaks, perhaps seeking to influence the process.The exceptional work of the Committee of Public Accounts led by the late Mr. Jim Mitchell is an example of good practice in this area. Is it not possible to empower Oireachtas committees and use them in certain circumstances to deal with matters of public concern? The public can see the live, televised workings of these committees and appreciates the excellent work done by many of them. That would also enhance the reputations of hardworking politicians.I welcome this Bill as establishing a new form of inquiry which will have clear time and budgetary constraints. It will use the skills of certain experts such as accountants and investigators, who have the skills necessary to deal with this type of work. Where necessary these commissions of inquiry could be the precursor to tribunals of inquiry which would ensure that the evidence collected by the commission would be available to a tribunal and thereby reduce the time and cost involved. The commission will also be conducted in a less adversarial atmosphere than the tribunals and people will not have legal or other representation. The commission's powers are extensive, including compellability of witnesses to attend, answer questions and disclose documents. It can also give directions to enter and search premises to seize documents and to refer certain matters to the High Court for its direction. It is comforting that there will be much tighter control of costs, which will be addressed at the outset. Time limits will also be required for completion of the investigations.While I broadly support this legislation, as Deputy Sargent said, we must also ensure that Dáil reform plays a central role in ensuring accountability. I ask the Government to reinstate the Freedom of Information Act, as originally enacted, to effectively respond to a new system and structure where commissions of investigation or tribunals will be rare events rather than the current ongoing spectacle to which we have become accustomed.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It may be unprecedented that all speakers have welcomed the Bill and it represents a good start. A note of criticism was raised by Deputy Costello who complained about the time it took to introduce the Bill and how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a queue of Bills waiting to be introduced. It struck me that if we did not lose so much time here on the Order of Business every day, we could squeeze in additional legislation every week. People should get on with the work of the House rather than play-acting at times.A clear need to have a forum or a facility for the examination of issues that may arise occasionally has been well established in the past 11 or 12 years. Nobody will attempt to deny that the need exists for a retrospective examination of certain issues that emanate from time to time from within the public service generally. Regardless of whether it is the checking up on actions of public representatives or any other person related to the operation of public service, or the actions of those affected by the public service, including the suppliers of services to it, we know there is a need for a method for a forensic examination of events that may arise from time to time.This is not an attempt to close down the tribunals and inquiries running at present. In the event of there being a need for a tribunal, following a finding of the commission of investigation, such a tribunal will be held regardless of the potential cost. We have several existing methods of examination, including an excellent forum in the shape of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I have been privileged to be a member for three Dáil terms. It is worth noting how far the previous Government extended the powers of that committee and of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Those measures were taken to ensure we are in a position of empowerment in summoning witnesses, papers etc. and in examining issues that come before us. This was probably one of the most progressive and important steps taken by the previous Government in the area of control within the public service.The previous Government and the current one increased the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to allow them to investigate fully and to deal with those who were untouchable under previous legislation. The Government has also introduced a regime of requirements for public representatives in the area of ethics and compliance to ensure there will be no repeat of alleged previous happenings, or if there is, there is legislation in place that will allow for appropriate penalties to be applied to the perpetrators of such actions.Despite introducing all that legislation, occasionally we will need to conduct more detailed inquiries, and that is what this legislation is all about. As I said earlier, there is universal support for some such facility and I am sure that other speakers will raise points of concern about aspects of the Bill and that these will be addressed in time as the debate goes on. If I have time later I will refer to some matters in sections 14 and 15. There is universal agreement that no country of our size can afford the present system for carrying out the examinations that I agree we need.This is an ongoing debate in the public domain about the cost of tribunals, which is the cause of huge concern to all of us who are taxpayers. As public representatives, we are in an awkward position in that, while being hugely concerned at the massive drain of funds from public coffers into the legal system, we are spancelled and almost afraid to comment on that aspect of things in case people think we are trying to cover up anything or trying to protect anybody. Unfortunately, we have a fairly muted approach to it at times. The cash drain cannot continue and one of the potentially negative results of the present system is that we may avoid examining fully some issues that should be examined for fear of legal costs involved. It is suggested at times that the costs involved are being exaggerated by both politicians and reporters on tribunals and inquiries. I do not believe there is any such exaggeration and we cannot continue to carry the burden of such costs. There must be an alternative option to the current system.I referred to the Committee of Public Accounts model and I believe this Bill will provide another much speedier, more understandable and far less costly method of doing the same job. The Committee of Public Accounts is extremely concerned about the potential cumulative cost to the State of all the inquiries. Bearing in mind that they use the formula of very high daily charges and an open-ended approach to the investigations, there is no possible mechanism for estimating how much will be spent before the expenditure takes place. I am not aware of any other area of Government or State expenditure that would be allowed that level of discretion. It is of huge concern to those of us taxed with the job of evaluating the value for money aspect of public expenditure within the Committee of Public Accounts and we hope to study the issue more in coming months. I hope we will be able to make recommendations that will complement this legislation.In his opening remarks the Minister mentioned that it is estimated that between 1997 and October 2003 the accumulated cost to the State of tribunals and other major inquiries was €100.99 million, which crucially does not include third party costs. He said that the annual cost of inquiries is about €47 million and that the accumulated cost overall could run to hundreds of millions of euro. When the cost comes in for all these inquiries, it will far exceed that figure if we do not make speedy changes. We have made inaccurate estimates in some areas. I mentioned last week that we estimated one figure for the cost of the pre-1953 social welfare stamps issue and the outturn will be eight times higher. However, in this case we are going in with our eyes open.The public will be as concerned as I am about the horrific cost. The problem with the approach to accounting taken with tribunals of inquiry is that it will be too late to do anything about the costs once they have been incurred. I am cautious about referring to the cost of any inquiry that is currently ongoing lest it be misinterpreted. However, I have no problem in commenting on the beef tribunal, which many people may have forgotten. It was set up as far back as 31 May 1991. The fees for that tribunal were as follows: senior counsel briefing fees, €10,668.00; junior counsel briefing fees, €7,112.00; senior counsel daily refresher fees for sitting days, €2,400.30 and for non-sitting days, €1,333.50; junior counsel daily refresher fees for sitting days, €1,600.20 and for non-sitting days, €889.00. Counsel for the tribunal were paid a different rate. Senior counsel received €2,286 on sitting days and €1,270 on non-sitting days, while junior counsel received €1,524 on sitting days and €1,270 on non-sitting days. These are astronomical figures, given that the tribunal sat for 226 days. However, there were 419 non-sitting days.When that tribunal was set up it was pointed out casually at the time that it could cost us a million or two million pounds and that it would be wasted money. As of 27 November last, the costs amounted to €26,413,251. Costs are still mounting. Estimated future costs are of the order of €3,121,715, which will almost certainly be paid out. That included a bill for administrative costs, stenographers' salaries and so on amounting to €3.4 million. When this tribunal was set up in 1991 there was no provision in the budget but the Government managed to spend more than €1.465 million. Provision was made in subsequent years and the costs increased every year. There was a small refund in 1995. More money was spent in 1996 and 1997. In 1998 more than €3.2 million was spent; in 2001, €491,000; in 2002, €961,000; and in 2003, €36,000. The bills are still being clocked up. This cannot continue. I do not care what wrongdoing there is. I do not care who is at fault. I do not care who must be punished.

Let us take it that an even €30 million was spent on that tribunal, whatever the outcome. The bottom line is that we could do much with that €30 million. I could spend the rest of the night, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would allow me, elaborating on how it could be used. We must make better use of our money and move in a far more positive fashion.The reason for setting up commissions of investigation is to examine issues of significant public concern. Further definition of what constitutes issues of significant public concern may be necessary. Otherwise seven or eight Deputies could apply formally every day to the Chair for a debate on matters of significant public concern, which would mean adjourning the Dáil.Section 10 of the Bill provides that the legal representatives of parties who are not being examined will not be present. I am concerned that a challenge might be mounted in the High Court or the Supreme Court to section 10 to ensure that the full team is present all the times. I do not believe that is necessary. That is how money is wasted. Unlike the Minister, I have no legal background, but I hope he will copper-fasten this such that it cannot be challenged and reversed. Section 11 provides for redress for people who feel they have been wronged.On the appointment of people to commissions, it is important that when we ask people to carry out a difficult task, that we respect them totally. In the past I have heard reference to the boundary commission for Dáil elections referred to as a Government appointed commission, the implication being that it is biased. The commission, which was nominated in 1978 or early 1979 comprises mainly ex officio members. They include the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad. It is grossly improper to suggest that they are in any way politically biased. There was similar reference in the past few days to another appointee, casting doubt on the integrity or bona fides of that person. If we go down that route it will be difficult to find people willing to serve on commissions. Whatever the background of the people who are asked to serve this State on a commission, we should respect them and the work they do.Section 6 deals with an area where we have learned most from previous experience. The Laffoy commission is the example that comes to mind. We found during the commission hearings that there was an obvious need to change its terms of reference. In section 6 there is an option to clarify, extend or limit the scope of an investigation. That must be spelled out and the financing will reflect that. That is critically important because, as happens regularly at the Committee of Public Accounts, one can begin to examine an issue and find out half way through that something else is the major problem and there is a need to refocus. We have the flexibility and ability to accommodate such circumstances. We work as a non-partisan, all-party group. We do not have votes. We work as a group with the wish to get the job done. Section 6 is crucially important to build in flexibility.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I wish to share time with Deputy Dennehy. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which concerns my constituency. This is the second such matter I have raised in the past fortnight which deals with company closures in my constituency.Yesterday, the Ridge Tool company, which was been in Cork for 25 years, announced its decision to lay off its staff of 66 by May of this year. With the announcement two weeks ago of job losses at CG Services and the closure of Jetmagic, this is the third in a series of company closures and announced job losses in my constituency since the start of the year. In light of further lay-offs at the Schering Plough factory in Dunderrow and Irish Distillers — I accept that the latter is not located in my constituency but many of its workers live there — it has been a bleak time in economic terms. An appropriate Government response is required for those who have found themselves in the unhappy situation of losing jobs in industries they thought were secure. There are also indications that jobs in the manufacturing sector in many other institutions throughout the country may not be secure.I wish to relate to the Minister of State the experience of a person with whom I went to school who has been working for Ridge Tool since completing his leaving certificate 23 years ago. As a result of the decision to relocate most of the company's activities to the United States and the remainder to China, he finds himself in a situation in which many other Irish workers are likely to find themselves in the near future. I want the Government to address the drift in manufacturing away from this country and on to Asia, in particular, and the effect this is likely to have on many Irish workers.When the company was down-scaling in recent years and offering voluntary redundancy packages, a person with my friend's experience was offered €20,000 more than what the company is now prepared to offer in closing the factory. Knowing where the threats lie and where the phase-out is likely to happen would help workers prepare for eventualities such as that at Ridge Tool. The inconsistencies between packages on offer before final closure and those on offer when the announcement was made, which were barely above statutory requirements, make this closure announcement upsetting to the workers involved. I want the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an appropriate intervention to ensure that these inconsistencies are addressed.

I echo his concerns about the employees and I support his expression of regret regarding the closure of the Ridge Tool company. I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1983 when the company commenced operations and I had the privilege of attending the official opening of the factory. Everybody saw Ridge Tool as a progressive, stable company. It is a matter of deep regret that it has decided to relocate.I support Deputy Boyle's call for assistance to be given to the employees of the company. This matter highlights the constant need to continue to make progress and not to become blasé about existing jobs. In the Mahon area we will hopefully be launching 6,000 service jobs shortly but these do not replace a solid production unit such as Ridge Tool. People can become casual, believe that everything is fine and forget about trying to encourage the establishment of new industry.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank Deputy Boyle for raising this matter and Deputy Dennehy for his expression of concern. Both Deputies represent Cork South-Central and they fully appreciate and understand the consequences for the people of Cork of the decision by the company to close its operations.The Tánaiste was disappointed at the announcement by the Ridge Tool company that it plans to close its manufacturing plant at Blackrock in Cork. She is also conscious of the adverse effects on those who will lose their jobs. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for FÁS and the State development agencies. In the coming days, FÁS will contact the company and make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, and identification of training needs and courses.While there has been some disappointing news in respect of job losses in Cork recently, there have also been a number of positive developments. There are 134 IDA Ireland-assisted companies in County Cork employing approximately 18,000 people. This is an increase of more than 20% in IDA Ireland-supported employment since 1999. In 2003, IDA Ireland announced 11 new projects from overseas companies for the Cork area, with the potential to create up to 800 new jobs. Highlighting the continuing confidence in the region, four of these new projects were expansions of existing operations, some of which included significant research and development investment. In addition, seven new start-ups were announced during the year, which include activities ranging from manufacturing and international services to high value research and development based activities.Some of the high value added projects to note in 2003 include the €35 million investment in research and development by GlaxoSmithKline, MA Com's investment in IC design and development, while ACS, TR Sensors, Schlumberger, Trend Micro and Transas will engage in high value software development, information technology support and operations management activities. Recordati, with an investment of €28 million, and Altana, with an investment of €70 million, will continue to expand the region's competencies in pharmaceuticals. New developments at Pepsi Cola and Minelab will include high value shared service and manufacturing activities. IDA Ireland will continue to market the Cork area actively to potential investors across a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, internationally traded services, financial services and information and communications technologies through its network of overseas offices and project divisions.Indigenous companies in Cork committed to invest €55.9 million last year to develop their businesses and were supported with Enterprise Ireland assistance packages of €10.5 million. Some 25% of Enterprise Ireland's investment in the county took the form of research and development and assisting companies to develop new products and technologies to increase their competitiveness.The major decentralisation package announced in the budget includes 920 jobs to be relocated to County Cork. This move demonstrates the Government's commitment to balanced regional development and will provide a further boost to enterprise development in Cork.I assure Deputies Boyle and Dennehy that the State development agencies, under the aegis of the Tánaiste's Department, will continue to promote both Cork city and county actively for investment and job creation. I have taken note of the case Deputy Boyle made about a person known to him who worked at Ridge Tool for a considerable period and also his concerns about inconsistencies in redundancy packages. I will bring his view on the matter to the attention of the Tánaiste at the first available opportunity.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	438	When will the green light be given to Ennis national school, which caters for more than 700 pupils? The most dramatic increase recorded in the recent population census was in County Clare in the mid-west region. The population of the county is now more than 103,000 with recorded growth standing at 9.9%, three times the rate of the previous five years. According to the Central Statistics Office, the population of the county is likely to increase even further. Much of the population is centred on the strong urban core of Ennis, which, with a population of more than 22,000, has become the tenth largest town in Ireland.To the disappointment of many, Ennis national school was not included in the 2004 capital building programme and, like all schools in County Clare, it was also excluded from the additional funding of €30 million announced recently by the Minister for Education and Science. I am disappointed the Minister is not present but I am sure the Minister of State will convey my sentiments to him.More than 700 pupils are registered in Ennis national school, which has a staff of 33. The school has 11 prefabricated buildings, consisting of six classrooms and five resource rooms. Students must endure terribly overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in these buildings, which are too warm in summer and very cold in winter. The main school is a single storey building designed in the 1970s with a flat roof. As the Minister of State will be aware, regardless of the architect, schools designed with flat roofs suffer constant water leaks. In addition, odours permeate the classrooms which is unhealthy for students and staff. The office is a small, congested cloakroom type building in which staff must also eat. The conditions, which I have observed at first hand, are unacceptable. Any time I call to the school, maintenance staff are working on the roof or making other repairs.I commend Mr. Gary Stack, the principal of the school, and his staff for the excellent work they have done to try to keep the school operating. In 1999, three prefabricated buildings were erected and paid for by the school board at a cost of €90,000, a sum still outstanding from the Department. I urge the Minister of State to convey this fact to the Minister.I understand the Irish National Teachers Organisation authorised the Health and Safety Authority to inspect the school and now awaits its report. I also understand that a team of five inspectors from the Department who visited the school before Christmas were amazed at the sub-standard conditions prevailing in the school.A green field site is available at St. Flannan's College for a new national school and Bishop Willie Walsh has been in contact with the Department in this regard. The current site is in a prime location on the junction of the Kilrush Road and is valued in excess of €6 million. To relocate the school to the green field site provided would not cost anything.In 2000, Ennis was the first area to go down the public private partnership route for a primary school. At the time, EUROSTAT raised objections about projects of this nature. I understand that these concerns were addressed in recent weeks and EUROSTAT has since given clearance for PPP school projects. Will the Minister of State provide an assurance that the project will proceed without further delay? The staff, teachers and parents do not know the status of the school on the Department's schools building list. Is it a high priority? I hope the Minister of State is in a position to answer my questions.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to this House, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, its strategy for capital investment in education projects, and the current position regarding the application received in the Department for improved accommodation at Ennis national school, Ennis, County Clare.Ennis national school is a co-educational primary school. Enrolments have been increasing steadily in recent years, from 654 pupils in 1998-99 to 704 pupils in September 2003. The school has a staff of a principal, 25 mainstream assistants, two learning support teachers, one special needs assistant and four resource teachers.An application for capital investment to carry out an extension at the school has been received in the Department. While the need for improved accommodation at the school is acknowledged, it was not possible to include provision for this project in this year's schools building programme. The 2004 schools building programme at primary and post-primary level, which amounts to €387 million, will deliver more than 200 large-scale projects. As the House will appreciate, however, it is not possible to include all necessary projects in one year's programme. The proposed project at Ennis national school is one of a number which must be considered in the context of future capital allocation for school building. I appreciate that Deputy Pat Breen may not be interested in other projects and his priority is to secure progress on Ennis national school.

Officials of the Department are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of this year's schools building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005 onwards. They expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year and the needs of Ennis national school will be considered in this regard.As an interim measure, significant grant aid has been provided to alleviate accommodation difficulties at Ennis national school. In 2001, grant aid was provided for the purchase of eight temporary classrooms and for air conditioning in the computer room. In June 2002, the Department authorised giant aid of more than €200,000 to fund health and safety works.

Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. He can be assured that I will convey to the Minister his genuine views on this matter, with a view to ensuring that Ennis national school will be considered at the earliest opportunity.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I thank the Minister and the House for the opportunity to raise the urgent need to improve the sewerage scheme at Kilmallock, County Limerick. The current scheme is 50 years old resulting in environmental and developmental concerns in the village. There is concern that damage is being done to the Loobagh and Maigue Rivers as a result of a lack of adequate facilities for sewerage disposal in Kilmallock. The existing treatment system is unable to take the loading from the town. There is a serious lack of development in Kilmallock, a matter with which I will deal in greater detail later.On 31 July 2003 the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, promised by way of letter that the scheme would commence in 2004. When will it commence and what is the expected date of completion? These are two vital questions to which the people, traders and organisations in Kilmallock want answers. The environmental section of the council is anxious to ensure sewerage disposal in Kilmallock complies with EU urban waste water treatment work directives.The scheme is costed at €9 million and the preliminary report is with the Department awaiting response. There is serious concern regarding development in the town. A proposal for the construction of 300 houses and a 20 bedroom hotel which would be of enormous benefit to the town is dependent upon completion of the scheme. There is a serious lack of employment opportunities in Kilmallock which lost approximately 260 jobs in the past five years: 120 in Diamond Engineering; 20 in Kerry Group Mill and 120 in Neo-Data Services. The people of Kilmallock are anxious to renew their town.In December 2003, Environmental Resources Management Limited presented a report commissioned by the Kilmallock town traders which outlined 37 recommendations for improvement in the town, many of them dependent on the construction of the sewerage scheme. The population in Kilmallock has also declined. It was 1,220 in 1986; 1,311 in 1991 and 1,231 in 1996. With proper support and a sewerage scheme, the population, as predicted by Limerick County Council development plans, could grow to 2,080 by 2021, an increase of 849 people. This is not a minimum or maximum population but a realistic guide to provide a framework for the provision of housing land and ancillary services in the town for the foreseeable future. The report by Environmental Resources Management Limited states that having consulted the people, traders and organisations, a practical vision of the town for the next decade has been developed. That vision includes Kilmallock as an attractive place in which to live with an increased population of 1,000 people. It will be a town with a full range of trading retail availability and full services.The proposals currently before the Department will provide for a population equivalent of 4,000 with a possibility of future development. I urge the Minister to address the serious concerns of the people and traders of Kilmallock to ensure the town has an opportunity to develop.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which arises in the context of the major investment being made by my Department, through the national development plan, in improving water services infrastructure throughout the country. Last August, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published the Water Services Investment Programme 2003-2005. Comprising 737 schemes at different stages of development, with a total investment of €5.4 billion, it is the most significant milestone yet in the push to bring our water services infrastructure up to world standards.The total allocated to Limerick under this latest phase of the water services programme amounts to approximately €350 million, extending to 24 individual schemes. These include major sewerage projects for Castleconnell, Adare, Patrickswell. Athea, Askeaton, Foynes, Shanagolden, Croagh and Glin. The Limerick main drainage scheme which will service large areas of the city and county is nearing completion. Castleconnell sewerage is now also operational.The programme also contains major water supply improvements throughout the county, including the upgrading of the Clareville water treatment plant. improvements to the Foynes water supply scheme, an upgrade of the Shannon Estuary water treatment works and the provision of new trunk water mains in various parts of the county. In addition, funding has been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet local housing needs.It is clear that a large number of towns and villages in Limerick are benefiting directly from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to modern standards. Rapid strides are being made to meet our obligations under the EU wastewater treatment directive. Local communities in Limerick, and throughout the country, are being provided with the infrastructure needed to facilitate new housing development, to support commercial growth and to protect the environment.I am pleased to confirm that €9 million of national development plan funding, under the current water services programme, has been allocated for the new sewerage scheme for Kilmallock. The programme provides for a 2005 start-up of the scheme and that is on track to be achieved.Deputy Neville referred to a letter he received from the Minister dated 31 July 2003 indicating a 2004 start-up date. That was the projected start-up time but the Deputy will appreciate there are so many stages involved in such schemes that short delays can occur. There are many bodies involved such as consultants, local authorities and the Department. A 2005 start-up has been scheduled and I will monitor developments to ensure we can achieve it. Limerick County Council's preliminary report for the scheme is under consideration in the Department. That report, as Members will be aware, is a detailed document which sets out the objectives, overall scope and outputs expected from the scheme. The Deputy will appreciate it cannot be dealt with overnight. I accept the Deputy's concerns and hope he will agree the projected date is a realistic one. The Department is committed to ensuring the Kilmallock scheme is moved forward as quickly as possible and will give the preliminary report every possible priority. Limerick County Council will be informed of the outcome as soon as a decision has been made.I appreciate the points made on the environmental concerns and the potential damage to the Loobagh and Maigue rivers and the development opportunities that will arise for the town and surrounds of Kilmallock as soon as this scheme is provided. I have no doubt that, with the increase in population from the 1,230 in 1996 to a projected 2,080 in 2020, this scheme will address those development opportunities.I assure the Deputy that I have listened carefully to what he has said. His comments will be taken into account by my Department in its examination of the preliminary report and in regard to the advancement of the scheme towards construction stage.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me time to speak on this issue which I consider to be a flagrant breach of the Protection of Animals Act. I refer to the granting of licences to the Ward Union hunt to use packs of hounds to hunt tame domesticated deer. I raise this matter in the context of what I consider to be the appalling record of disregard of animal welfare in this State.We recently saw exposed the so-called puppy farms, with their dreadful conditions, operating here in the absence of any legislative restraint, an activity not tolerated in Britain or other EU countries. We also have the unregulated growth in fur farming of Arctic fox without veterinary supervision and operated in a callous and cruel manner. This has been banned in other EU countries.This State still tolerates the barbaric treatment of timid animals in live hare coursing, which was recently outlawed in the North, yet here the responsible Minister refuses even to countenance the humane alternative available in drag coursing using a mechanical lure. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds is in the process of being banned in England but continues unrestricted here when drag hunting with a scented lure could easily remove the cruelty aspect.Perhaps most blatant of all is the issue I raise now, that of tame captive, farmed deer used to supply the Ward Union hunt which cruelly terrifies and hunts them with packs of hounds in clear breach of the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 which explicitly state that it is an offence to terrify or cause unnecessary suffering to any tame animal and expressly provide that a domesticated animal may not be treated in this manner.It was for that very reason that, in 1997, the department of agriculture in the North took legal and veterinary advice and concluded that deer tamed by their semi-intensive rearing system must be regarded as domestic animals and hunting them would be an act of cruelty and in breach of their welfare of animals Acts. The authorities in the North ceased to issue hunt licences and outlawed the practice. What happened in the Republic? The Attorney General's advice was sought but never revealed. It seems it is top secret, for whatever reason, and licences continue to be issued.Incredibly, that same year, 1997, our Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry's veterinary inspector, Mr. K.W.S. Kane, was authorised to compile a report on the activities of the Ward Union hunt. Mr. Kane's report is a damning indictment of that hunt. He states: "As the Red Deer herd presently kept at Green Park by the Ward Union Hunt has been maintained in captivity for something in the region of 150 years and is augmented regularly by stock from captive herds farmed solely for venison production, it is hard to see how they avoid falling into the category of "domestic animal" for the purposes of the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965". He further stated that stags are terrified, distressed and exhausted and that the hunts must be terrifying and stressful for the animal, that domesticated red deer are obviously unfit for a prolonged chase by hounds, and concluded: "It could be argued legally ... that the stags are domestic animals and do not fall within the ambit of the Wildlife Act, 1976 and thus that the hunts contravene the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965." Mr. Kane's report was ignored and was even refused by the Department concerned under the Freedom of Information Act when it was requested by animal welfare groups.I know the Minister of State will read his prepared script but I urge him to ask the responsible Minister to have this matter re-examined. It must be a scandal that the Government should connive in the manner I have outlined to subvert the protection of animals legislation in this State. This matter demands action and a resolute stand against the vested interests involved in torturing helpless animals.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position. The statutory responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are for the protection and conservation of wildlife species, including deer. Responsibility for implementing legislation on animal welfare rests with the Minister for Agriculture and Food.Section 26 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, which governs the licensing of the hunting of deer by stag hounds, refers generically to deer, and the question of whether deer are domestic or wild is not an issue in that section.On foot of a question raised by the heritage council in December 1997, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, then responsible for nature conservation, sought the then Attorney General's advice on the legal status of the deer used by the Ward Union Hunt Club as wild or domesticated animals and on any implications for the exercise of her powers under the Wildlife Act 1976 to license carted stag hunting by the Ward Union hunt, having regard to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 .The substance of the legal advice was that section 26(1)(ii) of the Wildlife Act 1976 had consistently been applied to license carted stag hunts, which are carried out only by the Ward Union stag hunt. At the time of the enactment of the 1976 Act, the only form of stag hunting within the State was a carted stag hunt and the section as enacted covers that; to interpret the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965 as prohibiting the carted stag hunt was to ignore the clear and emphatic language of section 26 of the Wildlife Act 1976. Deer maintained in the Ward Union Hunt Club deer park come within the clear scope of section 26(1)(ii) of the Wildlife Act 1976. The inclusion of deer in section 26 of the Wildlife Act 1976 was sufficient to empower the Minister to licence the Ward Union hunt. If the Minister refused to consider an application for a licence, the hunt could apply for an order of mandamus.
Issues concerning animal welfare in the conduct of the Ward Union carted stag hunt were comprehensively addressed in the hunting code of practice of September 1999 agreed between the Ward Union Hunt Club, the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Department of Agriculture and Food. A condition of the hunt club's annual licence requires compliance with this code of practice.Compliance with the conditions of the licence is monitored by conservation officers from my Department and, in an advisory capacity to my Department, by veterinary officers from the Department of Agriculture and Food. Their reports are considered in the context of issuing a licence for the following year. There is an annual inspection of the deer at the park at the end of the season to ensure that the deer are healthy and sound and that hunt records are complete. The last inspection was at the end of the 2002-3 season and showed no grounds for concern.

The Government's positive commitment to the social housing programme is shown in the increased provision for social and affordable housing in 2004. The total housing provision, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, in 2004 of €1.884 billion represents an increase of 5.4% on the 2003 provision. The increase in the housing provision will allow for 5,000 starts under the main local authority programme, an increase of 500 above 2003 levels, and a further 500 commencements under area regeneration programmes in 2004. In addition, the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will provide some 1,800 units of accommodation in 2004. Many of the housing units being provided by local authorities and voluntary and co-operative bodies in 2004 will be let to lone parents and persons on low incomes.The regulations made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in regard to changes in the SWA rent supplement scheme provide a number of exemptions. These are also reflected in guidelines issued by her Department to health boards regarding implementation of the new rules. My Department has advised housing authorities in regard to the changes. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs gave specific assurance in regard to the recent changes in the rent supplement scheme. She indicated, for example, that people who have particular problems and difficulties will be cared for, including people who are at risk of becoming homeless and other vulnerable people. In addition to the specific exemptions in the regulations, health boards have wide discretionary power to award rent supplement where the circumstances warrant payment. Accordingly, the question of additional provision in this context does not arise.The regulations providing for the changes to the rent supplement scheme were made on 18 December 2003. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs informed me on 12 November of the proposal to introduce changes in this area in the context of the 2004 Estimates. During the intervening period there was a considerable amount of interaction between the two Departments, particularly in relation to the need for adequate safeguards and exemptions to ensure that people with genuine needs would not be adversely affected and to monitor closely the effects of the changes. These matters have been reflected in the regulations and guidelines.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Regulations relating to the exposure of workers in Ireland to radon gas in the workplace are set out in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. This requires employers to measure workplace radon levels if so directed by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. It implements in Ireland the 1996 EU Council directive laying down basic safety standards for the protection of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation. The RPII is responsible for the enforcement of the order in Ireland.In addition, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 requires employers to identify the hazards at their workplace, assess the risk to health and safety from these hazards, and put in place measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. Where radon gas is identified as a hazard in the workplace the employer has a duty, as with any other hazard, to assess the risk and eliminate or reduce that risk. There is a general duty on employers in high radon areas to include radon in their risk assessment. This means that in order to comply with health and safety legislation, radon measurements should be carried out in indoor workplaces in these areas.These regulations and obligations are considered sufficient at this time and the focus is currently on information provision and direction, and encouraging key players towards fulfilling their obligations.In recent months the RPII has undertaken several initiatives to heighten awareness of the radon issue in Ireland. In October 2003, the RPII held the second in a series of three national radon fora in Galway to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. In November 2003 a media campaign on radon in the workplace was launched in ten high radon counties. Advertisements were placed in 13 local newspapers in counties Carlow, Clare, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.More recently, the RPII has been in discussion with SIPTU regarding radon in the workplace and have written an article about radon, including radon legislation, in the January SIPTU publication of "Report". In addition, in the coming months, it is the RPII's intention to continue this approach with other trade unions as well as with employers' groups. The RPII has also contributed to, and will be attending, a national forum on health and safety at work scheduled for 22 and 23 March.I want to reassure the House that both the RPII and my Department will continue to use appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon.

The 1997 Act had sought to provide an exemption for such costs.It follows that costs met from public funds must, if used for electoral purposes in the forthcoming European elections, be included in candidates' returns of expenditure to the Standards in Public Offices Commission.The court judgment has no implications for the local elections as expenditure limits do not operate in relation to these elections.Presidential elections were not addressed in the court action concerned and were not included in the order of the court. However, I am reviewing the part of the Electoral Act 1997 which still applies to a presidential election. If amending legislation is required in relation to the presidential election, I intend that this will be addressed in the coming months.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21 and 66 together.Exports of waste from Ireland are governed by the provisions of EU Regulation 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community. While the provisions of the regulation are detailed, the position, in summary, is that the requirements applying in a particular case are determined by whether the waste is shipped for disposal or recovery and the intended destination of the waste. In the case of shipments for recovery, the requirements are further dependent on whether the waste falls to be classified as "green", "amber" or "red" waste.In October last year, the Dutch authorities inspected a shipment of waste from Ireland which was in transit in Rotterdam awaiting onward shipment to India. I understand that the waste involved generally consisted of mixed recyclable materials such as cardboard, glass, plastic, paper and metals. The shipments had been ostensibly classified as "green" list waste on the basis that the waste was recyclable and contained a combination of waste types which were individually mentioned on the "green" list. However, on foot of their inspection, the Dutch authorities pointed to a 1998 European Court of Justice decision which held that mixtures of green list waste of municipal origin fell to be classified as "amber" list waste and, accordingly, deemed the shipment to be illegal.The Dutch authorities contacted the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2004 with a view to requiring arrangements to be made to have the shipment returned to Ireland. Following liaison between the agency's Office of Environmental Enforcement, the local authorities from whose areas the waste emanated and the waste contractors who had responsibility for the waste prior to shipment, the full consignment of waste has now been returned to Ireland and is in the process of being returned to the premises of the waste contractors concerned. The containers are being inspected by officials of the relevant local authorities with a view to establishing the appropriate means of dealing with the wastes involved.Following inspection by the Belgian authorities of a similar consignment of waste in transit in Antwerp, which appears to date from the same late 2003 period as the Rotterdam shipment, a request has been made to the Environmental Protection Agency for arrangements to be made for the return of this shipment to Ireland. I understand that arrangements are currently being made for the shipment to leave Antwerp by 11 March at the latest.Following the Rotterdam incident coming to light, my Department wrote to all local authorities — who are the competent authorities for the purposes of exports of waste — reminding them of the need to ensure correct classification of waste exports leaving their functional areas and requesting that they ensure that the matters involved were brought to the attention of relevant waste companies operating in their areas. In addition, the EPA's Office of Environmental Enforcement has issued detailed guidance to each local authority. Furthermore, following a seminar for local authorities on the establishment of an environmental enforcement network last month, the OEE has identified support for local authorities in the performance of their regulatory functions in relation to the export of wastes as an area for priority attention.I should point out also that a revised regulation to govern waste shipments was published by the European Commission last summer. I identified the advancement of the discussions on this proposal as a key objective of the Irish EU Presidency, particularly in terms of ensuring that as much clarity as possible is brought to bear in regard to the requirements involved. Following debate on the matter at the Environment Council earlier this week, work on the proposed regulation will now continue with a view to securing further progress on the matter at the June Council.

The two directives are under discussion in the European Council's Atomic Questions Working Group and to date have been addressed at three meetings of the group under the Irish Presidency. In the latter role, Ireland is seeking to find a sound consensus on this package which will enable its adoption at the earliest possible opportunity.The Irish Presidency will continue, through dialogue, to seek and develop consensus on the directives. While there will obviously be a need for flexibility to accommodate the different views of member states, the Presidency will be guided by the need to ensure that nuclear safety is not compromised. If satisfactory consensus on the matter can be found it will be brought to the appropriate Council at the earliest possible date.

A reply, responding to each of the points raised in the reasoned opinion, issued to the European Commission on 16 May 2003, set out our contention that the imposition of a €20 participation fee is not in conflict with the provisions of the directive.On 22 July 2003, the European Commission issued a press release in which it stated its intention to refer the case to the European Court of Justice. No official communication has been received from the Commission to date. I have no proposal to amend the relevant regulations which reflect an approach endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

The project has been advanced in a considered and thorough way from the enactment of enabling legislation in 1999 and 2001, through the procurement of a proven and robust system, together with comprehensive testing and successful piloting in Irish conditions. The Irish public is strongly in favour of electronic voting: 87% of voters surveyed after the 2002 general election preferred the electronic system to the paper ballot.The amended motion on electronic voting and counting approved by the Dáil on 18 February provided for: (a) the establishment of an independent body to verify the secrecy and accuracy of arrangements proposed for electronic voting — this body to be appointed in advance of the enactment of the legislation; and (b) legislation to give statutory recognition to this body; to apply electronic voting and counting to non-Dáil elections, to make more explicit arrangements regarding abstention from voting, and to clarify conditions under which tally data may be made available from the electronic counting system to interested parties.This legislation is being urgently prepared and will be published at an early date. In accordance with the amended motion, the Government has already, on 2 March, appointed and mandated a Commission on Electronic Voting and Counting, with membership and terms of reference as set out below.Electronic voting and counting is a welcome modernisation of our electoral process. It reflects a broader process of modernisation and an expectation that democratic processes should keep pace with other progressive developments in our society. I am confident that the new system procured by my Department will provide a reliable, efficient and user friendly service to Irish voters.The membership of the Electronic Voting and Counting Commission is as follows: The Hon Mr. Justice Matthew P. Smith who is Chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission will chair the Commission. It will also comprise: Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of Dáil Éireann; Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of Seanad Éireann; Dr. Danny O'Hare, Chairperson of the Information Society Commission and Former President of Dublin City University; and Mr. Brian Sweeney, Chairperson of Siemens Dublin Limited and a board member of the Smurfit School of Business. The Secretariat to the commission will be provided by the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.The commission's terms of reference are as follows: the Commission, which shall be independent in the performance of its functions, shall prepare a number of reports for presentation to the Ceann Comhairle on the secrecy and accuracy of the chosen electronic voting and counting system, that is, the Powervote-Nedap system; the commission shall make one or more of such reports to the Ceann Comhairle not later than 1 May 2004; the commission's subsequent report or reports will record its views of the operation and experience of electronic voting and counting at elections; in carrying out its work, it will be open to the commission to review the tests already undertaken to validate the electronic voting and counting system, and to have further tests undertaken, it may also retain the service of such consultants or other persons that it considers are desirable; and the commission shall be entitled to invite and consider submissions on such basis as it thinks appropriate.

The environmental impact statement for the proposed M3 was sent to my Department for comment on 4 March 2002 and comments were forwarded to An Bord Pleanála on 22 and 25 April 2002. These comments are summarised below.With regard to nature conservation, my Department is satisfied that the route proposed would not have a significant adverse impact on any designated area. The proposed route will cross sections of the Boyne and Blackwater Rivers, which were at the time under consideration for designation to protect salmon and its habitat. It was, therefore, recommended that the construction work would be carried out in consultation with the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, and mitigation measures to minimise any environmental impacts on habitats and species were also put forward.Regarding archaeology, my Department indicated that it agreed with the detailed recommendations in the EIS in relation to the mitigation of impacts on archaeology. The Department recommended that the archaeological mitigation measures proposed in the EIS for the project should be implemented and that a number of additional measures be undertaken, to include pre-development archaeological testing and assessment at various points along the proposed route.In addition, in regard to the architectural heritage, some issues as to the method used in the EIS to deal with this issue were raised.

The first five cases where legal action has been initiated arise with regard to directives concerning: dangerous substances in water; the protection of water against pollution by nitrates from agriculture; the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly known as environmental impact assessment or EIA; the keeping of wild animals in zoos; and end-of-life vehicles. The sixth case relates to a number of waste issues.Legislation is in place in respect of each of the above six directives, and the legal actions relate to issues regarding elements of transposition and implementation. The European Commission recently indicated its intention to withdraw the case regarding the zoos directive and confirmation of that decision is awaited. A further legal action has been notified to Ireland in respect of reporting requirements under an EU regulation on ozone depleting substances.The European Commission announced on 22 July 2003 its intention to take legal action against Ireland regarding the proposed decision by the Government to introduce a €20 charge on citizens wishing to make submissions on development consent procedures. The Commission also announced on 29 January 2004 its intention to take legal action against Ireland for alleged failure to designate a sufficient number of special protection areas, SPAs, for wild birds and adequately to protect sites that have or require SPA status. No communication has been received from the European Court of Justice in either matter.

My Department has written to all local authorities and the political parties on a number of occasions, drawing their attention to the provisions in the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 on the exhibition and distribution of election-referendum advertising materials, including the need to remove all posters and poster ties within seven days of the polling date. Local authorities have also been requested to explore with the political parties the possibility of having appropriate arrangements put in place at local level to remove election poster ties and thus eradicate this particular litter problem. Such arrangements could then apply for future elections or referenda. I have no proposals along the lines of that to which the question refers.

The guidelines will offer guidance to planning authorities on the reports that should accompany a planning application for a wind energy development including, where necessary, an environmental impact study to address, inter alia, the geological impacts of the wind energy development. The revised guidelines will be published for public consultation in the coming weeks.

In determining the maximum mortgage loan in each case, local authorities should have regard to the purchaser's ability to repay by reference to their net household income.My Department is keeping the terms of the loan limit under review, taking into account the movement in house prices, the effectiveness of various schemes in meeting the needs of the relevant target group and the availability of mortgage finance in the private sector. Work is continuing with representatives of the Irish Mortgage Council and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on the provision of finance by the lending institutions for affordable housing and other initiatives.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 64 together.I refer to the reply to Question No. 436 of 10 February 2004. The Government has decided that the EPA will be responsible in Ireland for implementing Directive 2003/87/EC, establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community. The agency is the designated national allocation authority to design and submit to the European Commission a national allocation plan, NAP, allocating the total quantity of allowances approved by Government for purposes of emissions trading by individual eligible installations. The EPA published its draft NAP on 23 February 2004 for public consultation in the period to 10 March 2004. The draft NAP listing allocations to individual installations is available on the EPA's website, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual allocations to installations, given the EPA's responsibility in this regard.The Government is making available an average of 22.5 million allowances per annum for the pilot phase of emissions trading over the three-year period 2005 to 2007. This represents, on average, an estimated 96% to 98% of expected emissions by the trading sector and is also less than the expected outturn in emissions for 2003 for the sector. The overall allocation to the emissions trading sector is designed to be consistent with achieving our national obligations to limit annual emissions in the period 2008 to 2012 to 13% above 1990 levels which becomes obligatory at that time under the Kyoto Protocol.The indicative allocation of an average 22 million allowances per annum announced by Government for the Kyoto phase is estimated to be 83% of installations' base case emissions averaged over the period. The allocation for this period takes account of the progressive reductions of emissions required towards achievement of the national Kyoto obligation while also recognising the learning by doing nature of the pilot phase. I am satisfied also that the creation of a market in CO2 allowances will provide an incentive, irrespective of the allocation made, for companies in the scheme, representing about one third of total national emissions, to achieve all reductions at up to and including the prevailing market price.The indicative announcement of annual purchases by the State of 3.7 million allowances on the international market is in respect of reductions in emissions from sectors of the economy outside emissions trading at costs above the projected market price of €10 and will not lessen the burden on the emissions trading sector. The consultancy study underpinning the Government's allocation to the trading sector estimated that participants in emissions trading will make purchases of circa 2.1 million allowances during the same phase after in-house reductions up to the projected market price of €10 per tonne are implemented.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Population levels in some parts of Dublin city, particularly in inner suburban areas, have been falling and are showing a trend towards smaller average household sizes. Such decreases in population levels have implications for service provision in these areas. It is also encouraging, however, to note that as a result of the Government's proactive urban regeneration policies, significant amounts of new residential development in Dublin's inner city and docklands areas have reversed the long-established trend of declining population levels in these areas.Two key planning policy documents issued by my Department have addressed the issue of declining population in parts of Dublin. First, Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density, 1999, promoted increased residential density in appropriate areas, including brownfield sites, and also on inner suburban in-fill sites. With regard to the latter, the guidelines stated that "The provision of additional dwellings within inner suburban areas of towns or cities, proximate to existing or due to be improved public transport corridors has the potential for revitalising areas by utilising the capacity of existing social and physical infrastructure. Such development can be provided either by in-fill or by sub-division [of large houses]." The guidelines have been successful in encouraging higher residential densities in urban areas; for example, most new housing within both inner city and suburban Dublin is now designed to meet the needs of smaller household sizes.Second, the national spatial strategy, NSS, emphasised the importance of consolidating the greater Dublin area. The physical consolidation of Dublin, supported by effective land use policies for the urban area itself is an essential requirement for a competitive Dublin. The NSS, therefore, recommended that the regional and planning authorities in the metropolitan area, that is, the built up area of Dublin and its immediate environs, should "carry out a systematic audit of all vacant, derelict and under-used land to establish its capacity to accommodate housing or other suitable uses. Such an audit should be focused in particular on areas in or close to public transport corridors and areas with under-utilised physical and social infrastructure (e.g. schools)." I am pleased to note that this recommendation has been incorporated into the draft regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area which, when adopted, will replace the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective. For example, 2003 was the ninth successive year of record housing output, with over 68,800 house completions, an increase of 19.3% on 2002. While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s, when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. Information on house prices are set out in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the OireachtasLibrary.The Government is also concerned to ensure that the needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs are met. Almost €3.8 billion was spent in the first three years of the national development plan on social and affordable housing measures and the housing needs of over 12,000 households will be met in 2004 compared to almost 8,500 in 1998. The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and in this way seek to bring moderation to the rate of house price increases.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Government affords a high priority to housing issues, as evidenced by the range of policies and measures employed by my Department and other public agencies involved to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is appropriately met. We have placed a strong emphasis on increasing housing supply to meet demand, particularly for first-time buyers, against a background of unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes.The measures introduced by the Government to boost supply and thereby improve affordability, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. Last year was the ninth successive year of record house completions nationally, with 68,819 units completed, an increase in output of 19.3% on the corresponding figure for 2002. There was also a 10.5% increase in output in the Dublin area in the same period. Indicative data available to my Department show that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market. The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply.Government interventions have boosted the supply of affordable housing under targeted schemes for low and middle income purchasers. More than 10,400 households have benefited under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes since January 1997. I anticipate that the numbers of such purchasers benefiting from affordable housing will further increase this year as more affordable housing comes on stream as a result of agreements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. In the first nine months of 2003 a total of 82 units were acquired and a further 449 units were in progress under Part V agreements, with a further 1,895 units proposed at the end of September 2003.The new affordable housing initiative introduced under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is also being progressed as a priority. This new initiative is aimed at those who in the past would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources, but find they are unable to do so in the current market. The Government made two announcements in July and December 2003 on the release of State and local authority lands in counties Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Cork and Waterford to the initiative. Both announcements are critical steps in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing on these sites and under the initiative and will result in approximately 6,100 housing units in total. This initiative, combined with Part V arrangements, will build on the progress made in delivering existing affordable housing schemes to boost the supply of affordable housing over the coming years.

The grant is the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. The correspondent was advised that if he had evidence of malpractice by local authority officials, he or she should report it to the Garda Síochána or, if appropriate, to the Tribunal of Inquiry into Planning Matters and Payments.The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, provides for a presumption of corruption where there is proof that certain persons in public office have received money or other benefits from a person who has an interest in the way certain functions are carried out or the outcome of certain planning decisions. This provision is designed to make the investigation of corruption an easier task for the law enforcement agencies and it places the onus on the person receiving the payment to prove that the payment is legitimate.

This encompasses giving priority to key proposals on nature conservation, including financing for management of Natura 2000 sites. A communication from the Commission on this topic is expected shortly, and I look forward to chairing discussions on the matter in the Environment Council.It is the responsibility of accession countries to transpose and implement EU directives relevant to nature conservation, and a matter for the European Commission, rather than the Council of Ministers, to ensure compliance with such directives.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Electoral legislation on paper based voting addressed the phenomenon of spoilt votes and required returning officers to discard these for the purposes of the valid poll. Aggregated information on such spoilt votes has been published traditionally as part of official election returns, but not as a legal requirement.Because the electronic voting and counting system is designed to prevent unintended spoiling of votes, the above legislative provisions, based on paper ballots, are explicitly disapplied from electronic voting and counting. Instead, new legislative provisions require a record to be kept of deactivations of the voting machine, in the event that a person approaches the voting machine but departs without pressing the "Cast Vote" button. On the basis of an improvement to the electronic voting machine implemented since the 2002 pilot exercises, records of all deactivations will in future be stored by the machine and be available as part of the election statistics provided by the system.This recording feature was not incorporated in the version of the machine used in 2002. At the general election and second Nice treaty referendum, returning officers were required to record the incidence of deactivations in polling stations manually. While my Department understands that this manual recording was carried out, aggregate results were not in the event published by returning officers in the official election returns.In the context of my Department's information booklet on referenda generally, which is published periodically, my Department will seek to include information regarding deactivations in the constituencies which employed electronic voting at the second Nice treaty referendum. From information available from the areas concerned, some 500 deactivations would have been recorded across the seven constituencies, compared with 270,124 votes validly cast.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I assume that the question refers to the years 2003 and 2004. The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, compared with 39,176 households in March 1999. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.The Sustaining Progress special initiative on housing and accommodation reflected the Government's expectation that the resources available in 2003 allowed for the needs of about 12,000 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures. A similar level is expected to be achieved again in 2004. This compares with almost 8,500 households in 1998. Local authorities completed or acquired 5,074 units in 2002 and almost 5,000 units in 2003. At this stage, it is estimated completions and acquisitions will be approximately at the same level in 2004.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I was pleased to announce that 2003 was the ninth consecutive year of record housing output with 68,819 units completed, a 19.3% increase on 2002 levels. There was also a significant increase in the output of housing in Dublin in 2003, with completions of 14,394, an increase of 14% on last year.This outcome is proof that Government measures to boost housing supply and thereby improve affordability are having effect. Within the environment set by these policies, we have seen a positive response from the construction industry, local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector to meeting the unprecedented demand for housing that we have experienced in recent years. We do not have a definitive breakdown of house completions either by type of purchaser or whether they were second or holiday homes or intended for renting. However, indicative data available to my Department show that first time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market. My Department is in discussion with the Central Statistics Office regarding the collection of more reliable information on second homes with the objective of addressing this information deficit.The Government has been actively responding to the increased level of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output very significantly. Full data on the output from the range of social and affordable housing measures will be published later this month. It is estimated that the needs of over 12,000 households were addressed through these measures in 2003. The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of overall housing supply in 2004 and to support the needs of low-income groups through the broad range of social and affordable housing measures.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 145 together.I am aware of the comments made by the Coadjutor Archbishop of Dublin, as referred to in the question. I wish to reiterate the Government's commitment to tackling this serious issue on a sustained basis with the aim of eliminating the need for rough sleeping by the end of 2004 and of providing adequate emergency and move on accommodation and support services to enable homeless persons to achieve independent living as soon as possible.Considerable progress has been made since the publication of the Government's Integrated and Preventative Strategies on Homelessness in 2000 and 2002, respectively. As part of this process, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons.A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation has been provided. This has enabled rough sleepers to access emergency accommodation and allowed homeless persons to move out of emergency accommodation and into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough, as well as homeless offenders, have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans with particular emphasis on the provision of move on accommodation to minimise the long-term use of both emergency and bed and breakfast accommodation.In Dublin, the Homeless Agency is responsible for the planning, co-ordination and delivery of services to people who are homeless. Substantial progress has been made in tackling homelessness under the existing action plan for Dublin, Shaping the Future, including the housing of almost 1,500 homeless persons by the local authorities, voluntary housing sectors and the Housing Access Unit in the three year period 2001-2003, the provision of more than 1,000 additional emergency beds and specialist designated accommodation for street drinkers and drug users. I understand that the preparatory work for the next plan is nearing completion.Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Current Exchequer funding for accommodation related homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from €12.6 million in 2000 to €51 million this year. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million during the period 2001 to 2005. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme.With a view to ensuring that progress is sustained, the Cross Department Team on Homelessness continues to monitor the implementation of the homeless strategies and a review of the strategies is expected to be initiated shortly.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	489	On 9 February 2004, I issued a direction under section 31(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in regard to the draft Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Development Plan 2004-2010. A planning authority is required to comply with any such direction.The direction judges that the draft Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county development plan is deficient in that it does not zone sufficient residential land in order to satisfy the requirements of the council's housing strategy; such sufficient zoning is required under section 95(1)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Accordingly, the direction requires the council to amend the draft development plan to ensure that sufficient and suitable land is zoned as residential or for a mix of residential and other uses in order to meet the requirements of the housing strategy. Decisions as to the specific lands to be zoned in order to meet this requirement are entirely a matter for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.In regard to the direction, I received correspondence from the Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and from the county manager requesting the issuing of such a direction. I have also received correspondence from residents' organisations and from private individuals on matters relating to the zoning of land in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.The power to issue directions in regard to draft development plans is a relatively new provision in planning legislation introduced under the Planning and Development Act 2000. No other similar directive has so far been issued.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	491	There are no actual fusion experiments being co-ordinated in Ireland, nor is it envisaged that such experiments would take place here.Ireland's involvement in nuclear fusion research relates mainly to the study of the properties and behaviour of plasmas, the high temperature highly ionised gas in which nuclear fusion takes place. Much of this research is directed towards utilising the properties of plasmas in the fields of electronics and the production of medical devices. The funding for such research comes largely from the EURATOM research framework programme, and the research is carried out in academic establishments.I am advised that there are no implications from such research on the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I am also advised that one can never say categorically that the results of fusion research will not be hijacked by terrorists intent on using them for destructive purposes. Nevertheless, if fusion reactors were to replace fission reactors there would be no further need for uranium enrichment facilities which present a potential source of nuclear materials for terrorists. Also fusion reactors, unlike fission reactors, do not produce plutonium, which could also be used to produce nuclear weapons.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Recycling is a significant element of the Government's overall integrated policy framework on waste management — based on the internationally recognised waste hierarchy — prioritising waste prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and the environmentally sound disposal of residual waste which cannot be recycled or recovered.This significant emphasis on recycling is reflected in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, which provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans under which specific national objectives and targets would be achieved. Specifically, Changing our Ways set ambitious recycling targets to be achieved over a 15-year timescale, as follows: recycling of 35% of municipal waste; and recycling of at least 50% of construction and demolition, C&D, waste by 2001, with a progressive increase to at least 85% by 2013.Changing our Ways set a number of complementary targets aimed at increasing recycling rates, to be achieved over the same timescale, including: a diversion of 50% of household waste from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; and the development of composting and other biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum.National waste statistics are published at three-yearly intervals by the EPA. The most recent national waste database report in respect of 2001, which was published in July 2003, estimated that out of total municipal — household and commercial — waste of 2,297,603 tonnes in that year, 305,554 tonnes, 13.3%, were recycled. This is an increase from 166,684 tonnes, or 9%, in 1998 and 117,732 tonnes, or 7.8%, in 1995. These figures indicate that significant progress is being made in this area and that we are now moving towards EU average municipal waste recycling rates. In addition, the 2001 EPA report estimated that of the 3,615,163 tonnes of C&D waste sent to landfill that year, just under 2.4 million tonnes, or 65.4%, was recovered and used for construction purposes or as landfill cover, thereby achieving the initial C&D waste recycling target set in Changing our Ways.All the indications are that the recycling position has improved even further since 2001 arising from the implementation of the local and regional waste management plans, as follows: the progressive roll-out of household segregation and separate collection of dry recyclable and organic waste in urban areas — approximately 500,000 households nationally are now served by segregated household collection of recyclables whereas minimal numbers of households were served by such service in 2001 and separate collection of organic wastes has recently commenced in a number of areas and is to be extended to further areas in the near future; the continued expansion of the bring bank network — over 1,800 bring banks are currently in place compared to around 1,400 in 2001 and 850 in 1998; and the increased network of civic amenity recycling centres and waste transfer stations being progressively put in place — there are now approximately 50 civic amenity sites or recycling sites around the country accepting a wide range of materials for recycling.In addition, new packaging regulations introduced last year requiring the segregation and recycling of specified back-door packaging waste by producers have influenced increased recycling rates in the commercial sector.The expansion in the waste recycling infrastructure outlined has been assisted by significant funding provided to local authorities from the environment fund, which is financed by the proceeds generated by the landfill and plastic bag levies. In addition, an intensive waste awareness and communications campaign Race against Waste was launched in October 2003, aimed at heightening awareness among businesses and householders alike of the need to increase recycling rates. This campaign is being funded by the environment fund.With a view to providing further impetus in this area, I will shortly be announcing implementation details of commitments contained in the Delivering Change policy statement published in 2002, as follows: the establishment of a market development programme to ensure that end markets exist for the materials which are collected for recycling; the publication of a national biodegradable waste strategy which will set out measures to progressively divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill and to provide an effective basis for the achievement of the 2013 target set in Changing our Ways; and the development of further producer responsibility initiatives, in addition to existing initiatives on packaging, farm plastics and C&D wastes, on specific waste streams, that is, end-of-life vehicles, waste electrical and electronic equipment, newsprint and tyres.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I have continuously raised the issue of discharges of technetium-99 and other radionuclides from Sellafield into the Irish Sea with United Kingdom ministers, most recently when I met the Secretary of State for the Environment in December 2003. The decision, announced in June 2003, to proceed with trials in relation to TPP came as a result of a review of the discharge limits for technetium-99 from Sellafield, for which the Irish Government had pressed strongly. Following this review, the UK Government requested BNFL to cease discharges of technetium-99 to the Irish Sea pending plant trials of TPP.TPP is an organophosphate which, when introduced into a chemical process during radioactive waste conditioning at Sellafield, combines with technetium-99 to create a solid compound. Following laboratory tests, a plant scale trial of the process was carried out by the Environment Agency and BNFL in November and December 2003. The trial is being conducted to assess the efficiency of removing technetium-99 from liquid discharges into the Irish Sea. As well as assessing TPP's ability to combine with technetium-99, the trial has looked at the costs of the process, the environmental impact of TPP, the form of waste produced, the safety and operability of the process and its impact on public and worker safety.While the Environment Agency has reported informally on the mechanics of the trial, official results have not yet been published. I understand that, for TPP to be used on an ongoing basis by BNFL, authorisation by the regulators will be necessary. BNFL will need to obtain approval from the Environment Agency for TPP discharges, a letter of comfort from Nirex for the storage of solid technetium-99 waste, and approval from the nuclear installations inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive for the new processes involved.I have asked the Secretary of State for a full report on the trials once final conclusions have been drawn. Experts from the RPII have also been in contact with their counterparts in the UK Environment Agency concerning the progress of the trials.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	496	In August 2003 I announced a review of the retail planning guidelines in regard to the floor space cap on retail warehouses contained in the guidelines. The guidelines currently prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 sq. m. gross retail floor space for large scale single retail warehouse development. This cap is now being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats, while also having regard to issues of proper planning and sustainable development. Central to this review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have the range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. Some 71 submissions were received by and are now being assessed. They will be fully taken into account in considering further whether any changes are needed in the guidelines. I expect that the process will be completed shortly.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I am aware that intruder alarms gave rise to 7% of the noise complaints made to Dublin City Council in 2002, down from 11% in 2001. Noise from alarms was the third lowest of all categories of complaints listed by the council in the annual report of its noise control unit for the period 2002-2003. Nonetheless I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise nuisance. Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate, with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise. A number of additional arrangements are in place to reduce the incidences of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has published a voluntary standards specification, No. 199 of 1987, and operates a certification scheme to that standard which specifies a minimum 15 minutes and maximum 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings with the alarms being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, inter alia, upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers, and the provision to the Garda of contact details for the key holder and alternate key holders.A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all national standards, will incorporate considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits will be 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum. This new standard is the only one applied by the NSAI for intruder alarms installed from 1 March 2004.In addition, the Private Security Services Bill 2001 when enacted, will provide for a private security authority to license, control and supervise all alarm installers and for the authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms.I understand that the promulgation of the Irish standard, the introduction of the European standard, the requirements of the Garda for monitored alarms, improved equipment and the co-operation of the installers certified by the NSAI have together been instrumental in ensuring the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off have been significantly reduced.Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A free public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department.In light of the above, I have no proposals at this time to introduce further legislation as regards noise arising from house alarm systems.

Water is generally supplied to the 46,000 households involved without prior treatment or disinfection.The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, which is representative of the local authorities, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the rural organisations and my own Department, has produced an Action Plan for Rural Drinking Water Quality 2003 — 2006 that has as its objective the urgent upgrading of water quality in privately sourced group water schemes.The action plan sets out a strategy for bringing substandard schemes up to the required standard through connections to local authority systems, the taking in charge of individual schemes by local authorities and, where these options are not practicable, the provision of on-site water treatment and disinfection facilities. Grants of up to 100% of cost are available to group schemes for treatment and disinfection facilities. An 85% grant, subject to a maximum of €6,475 per house, is payable for related civil works such as buildings, reservoirs and pipelines, and for upgrading works and connections to public supplies.A sum of €644 million has been provided under the National Development Plan 2000 — 2006 for the upgrading of rural water infrastructure, particularly privately sourced group water schemes. Last year I allocated a record €100 million for the 2003 rural water programme. I will shortly announce details of the 2004 block grant allocations to county councils under that programme. The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee's action plan acknowledges the adequacy of the NDP funding available for the rural water programme and identifies the key issue now as one of logistics and speed of implementation.In accordance with the action plan strategy, there are currently 16 projects, involving some 176 individual group water schemes serving around 30,000 households, at construction or at an advanced stage of planning. A further five projects, involving 69 group schemes serving over 6,000 households, are at an earlier stage in the planning process. Proposals to resolve the water quality deficiencies in the remainder of the schemes concerned are being advanced as rapidly as possible.

There is a statutory requirement where returns are filed late for a late filing penalty to be paid. It is the policy of the CRO that late filing penalties are waived only in exceptional circumstances, and for particular categories of company, such as charities, on a once-off basis only.The company in question is the kind of company, which would be considered for a once-off waiver of late filing penalties, on the basis that its objectives and activities relate to the promotion of community welfare in its local area.The company's 2002 annual return was due to be made up to a date no later than its annual return date of 12 June 2002, and had to be filed with CRO no later than 12 July 2002 in order to avoid late filing penalties. In the event, that return was not filed until 25 October 2002, thus incurring a late filing penalty of €418. This late filing penalty was waived, on the basis of the applicable criteria, on a once-off basis and the company was so informed.The company's 2003 annual return was due to be made up to a date no later than 12 June 2003, and had to be filed no later than 12 July 2003 in order to avoid late filing penalties. That return was not filed until 25 January 2004, thus incurring a late filing penalty of €694. I understand that the late filing penalty has been paid.The CRO never allows a second waiver of late filing penalties, having regard to what has been advertised and notified to beneficiary companies as the once-off nature of the waiver. The CRO is accordingly not prepared to refund the late filing penalty.As regards its 2003 annual return, CRO records show that the company was notified, by a letter from the office dated 14 May 2003, of its upcoming annual return date, of 12 June 2003, and once the filing date had passed without the return being filed, the office issued a letter to the company dated 14 July 2003 to remind it that it was now incurring late filing penalties and should file without delay. I agree with the CRO's policy in this matter. I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to grant a second waiver in this case.

‘A’ Region
Border, Midlands, West4040404040plus 15% gross for SMEsThe rates above are subject to the new multisectoral framework for large investment projects, which progressively reduces the effective grant ceiling for regional aid below the levels set out above where the value of the investment being aided exceeds €50 million inclusive of grant assistance.As the table indicates, from 2000 Ireland was still entitled to provide significant rates of regional aid throughout the country and less so in the Dublin region. In line with the regional aid map, regional aid can continue to be awarded up to a rate of 40%, or 55% for SMEs, in the BMW region until the end of 2006. The aid rates elsewhere, other than Dublin, have been gradually declining since 2000. This is due to the fact that, in accordance with Article 87(3) of the EU Treaty, regional aid is permitted in the most disadvantaged regions of the European Community only where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment. In less disadvantaged regions, regional aid may be given where such aid does not affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.While the regional aid rates listed above are secure until end 2006, given Ireland's level of economic development in recent years we cannot expect to be able to provide significant rates of regional aid after 2006. In addition, the European Commission has signalled its intention to significantly reduce the scope for regional aid for large companies in all member states after 2006. However, it should be remembered that regional aid is not the only form of State aid that may be given to assist company development. State aid may also be given throughout Ireland under various EU guidelines relating to European Community objectives such as research and development, employment, development of SMEs, training, and environmental protection.In deciding on levels of grant aid within the rates permitted in the Regional Aid Map, IDA Ireland operates a set of internal negotiating guidelines. These negotiating guidelines are designed to ensure that the maximum value for money is achieved consistent with facilitating the development of desirable investment initiatives; provide more aid for particularly high quality and strategically important investments that are in line with enterprise development policy and Ireland's competitive characteristics; and help implement IDA Ireland's regional development strategy, which includes a high priority on increasing the level of investment going into less developed regions, particularly the BMW.It is important to remember that EU State aid regulations apply to all member states. IDA Ireland continues to successfully attract investment within the framework set by the existing regulations.

In 2003 as many as 14% of the total eligible male animals in the category qualified for the payment with the balance being paid for first age steers.It is not expected that decoupling will lead to a significant increase in male cattle exports.

This resulted in an overclaim of 6.27 hectares or 99.21%. The claimant was consulted about the matter and he accepted the gross area of 6.32 hectares as correct.Under EU regulations where an applicant makes an area overclaim of greater than 50%, no premia payments are made for the year of application. In addition, a forage area equal to the eligible forage area found 6.32 hectares will be deducted from the eligible forage area found during the three years following the year of application in so far as premia payments are concerned.The area claimed by the applicant on his 2003 area aid application was reduced to zero in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, he cannot be paid premia for 2004 in respect of the first 6.32 hectares of eligible forage area claimed. His single payment entitlement will not be effected by the penalty.The EU regulations governing the 2003 area based compensatory allowance scheme are somewhat different. Although the person named cannot be paid the 2003 allowance because the difference between the area declared and the area found exceeded 20%. He can be paid for the next three years if eligible each year under the regulations for such payment.

The principles governing rent schemes are as follows: the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children including those under 21 years of age in full-time education; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.Within the broad principles outlined above, authorities have discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and anomalies that arise in individual cases. By definition, local authority rents should reflect ability to pay. They bear no relation to economic rents in the private sector. Based on the most recent returns from local authorities the average weekly rent in 2002 was €29.62 per week.It is clear that local authority rents are heavily subsidised at present. It would not be appropriate to provide subsidised housing to a person and then offer a further subsidy through the tax system. At present I have no plans to introduce a scheme whereby tenants renting local authority houses can claim tax relief on rent paid.I have received no correspondence from Fingal County Council in respect of the motion referred to by the Deputy.

Combined, these two legal instruments implementing EU Electricity Directive (96/92/EC) Concerning Common Rules for the Internal Market in Electricity, provide the overall legislative framework for the developing competitive electricity sector.The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the introduction of limited competition in the electricity market. It also provided for the establishment of the CER that took over from the ESB the function of licensing the generation and supply of electricity and overseeing access to the transmission and distribution systems and related charges.The subsequent European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulation 2000 provided for, inter alia, the licensing and establishment of the independent transmission system operator known as EirGríd. It also provided for the functions and licensing of the transmission system owner, the ESB, and the distribution system operator.The EU Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC is required to be transposed into Irish law by 1 July 2004. It strengthens the unbundling provisions of the transmission and distribution operators, explicitly provides for levels of consumer protection and sets out a timetable for market opening. It also requires member states to ensure proper regulation by independent national regulatory authorities.The regulatory framework currently in place here already takes account of many of the provisions of the new directive. At present my Department is finalising a draft statutory instrument under the European Communities Act 1972 to give effect to the requirements of the new directive and build on the measures already in place. While unbundling in the area of transmission operation has already been catered for, the legislation will provide for the legal unbundling of the distribution system operator.The legislation will seek to explicitly set out the rights of consumers regarding their dealings with suppliers along with enshrining the right of all customers to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at reasonable prices.With regard to the market opening provisions of the directive, on 19 February electricity market opening increased from 40% to 56% by virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Eligible Customer) (Consumption of Electricity) Order 2003 (SI No. 632 of 2003). All large and many small and medium-sized businesses are now eligible customers and are free to source their electricity from licensed electricity suppliers other than the ESB. All customers have been free to purchase electricity from any green or combined heat and power licensed supplier since February 2000 and April 2001, respectively.The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Eligible Customer) (Consumption of Electricity) Order 2003 also provides for the full liberalisation of the electricity market. By 19 February 2005 every customer will be eligible to source electricity from any supplier licensed by the CER. This date is well in advance of the July 2007 deadline for full liberalisation of electricity markets set down in the new electricity directive.

It is subject to a wide range of legislative controls. The opening and operation of retail pharmacies in Ireland is governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875-1977, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act. Any individual or company may open a pharmacy providing that the shop and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions are personally supervised by a full-time pharmacist who is not acting elsewhere in a similar capacity. This has been the position since 1890.The issue of pharmacy regulation was examined by the Pharmacy Review Group. I established the Pharmacy Review Group in November 2001 to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group submitted its report on 31 January 2003. I have been examining the complex legal and other issues surrounding the group's recommendations. Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the report's recommendations before completion of this examination. I have published the Pharmacy Review Group report on the Department's website, www.doh.ie.

Its recommendations have been accepted by Government. The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first phase of the programme will be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.The implementation of the report's recommendations is my most important priority in cancer services in the acute hospital setting. As a first step, I have provided additional resources this year to begin to implement the report's recommendations. In regard to the supra-regional centre at University College Hospital, Galway, I am making available €2.5 million ongoing revenue funding for this service this year. This centre is constructed and the equipment is currently being commissioned. Last year, I approved the appointment of a consultant radiation oncologist. This week, I approved the appointment of a second medical oncologist and an additional consultant radiation oncologist with significant sessional commitments to the North-Western Health Board.I have requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate an increase from three to six in the number of linear accelerators at UCHG in the medium term. I have also approved the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion in the region. The project team will meet for the first time next week. These developments will have significant benefits for patients in the north-western region.It is my intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology, based on equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme. As recommended in the report, I have established the National Radiation Oncology Co-ordinating Group. The group, which recently held its first meeting, comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. I expect the group to develop proposals in these important areas.The Government has also decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.

The independent three person panel was established to report, in general terms, on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime. The panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that it assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation.I am aware of the report of the EU Committee on Petitions and their fact finding mission to Ireland on the effects of taxi liberalisation. As I have explained previously in the House and to the committee, based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders for open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. The position remains unchanged and I have no proposals to reopen either the terms of the taxi hardship panel report or the Government's decision on it.The process of implementing the panel's recommendations through the taxi hardship payments scheme is well under way with Area Development Management Limited administering and managing it. Payments to qualifying persons commenced in December 2003.With regard to the third recommendation of the EU Committee report concerning regulation and standards, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, enacted in July 2003, provides a legislative basis for the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation. A commissioner must also be selected by open recruitment competition held by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.Following a competition for the post of taxi commissioner in 2003, the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission was unable to recommend a candidate for appointment. A further recruitment competition is being progressed with an enhanced salary and the closing date for receipt of applications is 4 March 2004.The taxi commission will be an independent public body. Its principal function will be the development and maintenance of a new regulatory framework for the control and operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers. It will pursue a range of objectives that will be focused on the promotion of quality oriented services by all small public service vehicle operators and drivers. This will be based primarily on the deployment of new qualitative standards, to be applied to the licensing and ongoing operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers, that will be focused on the enhancement of customer services.

Dublin Bus has arranged its own inquiry, which will be carried out by a team headed by the Dublin Bus Board member Mr. Arnold O'Byrne. The second investigation, being conducted by the gardaí, will take precedence over the Dublin Bus investigation. It will follow standard Garda procedure in respect of the investigation of fatal traffic accidents.The primary immediate investigative role in regard to road accidents is vested in the Garda Síochána. Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of road accidents and in particular to the determination of whether a breach of the road traffic laws contributed to the occurrence. The Garda Síochána is the body empowered to make such a determination and to launch criminal proceedings against any person who the gardaí consider should be accused of the commission of an offence.Given the pivotal role played by the gardaí in accident investigation, they are tasked with the preparation of detailed reports in regard to each accident they attend. These reports are passed on to the National Roads Authority and subsequently to each local authority for the purpose of the establishment of accident trends and causes generally and to facilitate the carrying out of remedial works relating to road infrastructure where such action is deemed to be necessary.The inquiry being carried out by Dublin Bus will seek to investigate the circumstances of the accident to establish its causes and any contributory factors and will make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. Any such recommendations, which refer to the locating of bus stops and termini or to the use of such facilities, will inform the development of the new statutory arrangements envisaged under the Road Traffic Act 2002.My Department has not consulted directly with the director of traffic in Dublin City Council in regard to this accident. Any such process of consultation would also be informed by the outcome of the current investigations.

This document focuses on certain prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases in prisons in Europe and Central Asia. While I have no difficulty with many of the points made in the paper, I do not agree with certain recommendations and statements, such as the provision of sterile syringes and injecting paraphernalia to prisoners. The paper also calls for a policy of harm reduction rather than zero tolerance of drug use in prisons.In this country, it has been long-standing practice to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-AIDS among the prison population and this will continue to be the situation. Prisoners with a diagnosis of HIV, hepatitis, or other infectious disease continue to receive medical treatment while in custody, in line with clinical recommendations. Indeed, this medical treatment is generally in line with that available in the community. It has been long-standing practice to refer prisoners suffering from infectious diseases to specialist hospital services and to act on the basis of the clinical advice received. All such treatment is provided on the basis of informed consent. Emphasis within prisons is on health education and appropriate substitution treatment, where required. There is an ongoing process of education and information supply to prisoners regarding risks of infection and appropriate prevention strategies.It is my policy to apply best practice to the prison situation. Best practice, as far as I am concerned, is to prevent drugs from being introduced into or used in prisons. The programme for Government commits me to creating a drug free Prison Service with mandatory drug testing of prisoners. I intend to put this commitment into effect and expect to receive shortly, from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, a new set of prison rules which will make provision for, among other things, mandatory drug testing.In addition, a group consisting of Irish Prison Service management, including prison governors and health board staff together with relevant clinicians have prepared a draft prison drug treatment policy which I am currently considering.It is both my policy and that of the Irish Prison Service, in common with most prison systems worldwide, not to issue needles or injecting equipment to prisoners. The Report of the Group to Review the Structure and Organisation of Prison Health Care Services considered the matter of developing a syringe exchange programme within Irish prisons and came to the conclusion that such a step could not be recommended.

This application was unsuccessful. She had an Irish born child in September 2002 and applied for residency on the basis of parentage of that child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered — but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport her. In that context she has already been notified of such proposal and was given an opportunity to make representations in regard to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order she will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.If she is given permission to remain in the State she would then be in a position to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and obtain a certificate of registration card. Because of the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be further examined.

A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options, viz., to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of the deportation order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a deportation order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.Under section 3(6) of the Act the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to 11 specified considerations, one of which is any representation made by or on behalf of the person. The determination as to whether a deportation order is made or whether leave to remain is granted is not dependent on whether, in fact, the person has made representations for leave to remain. Thus, statistics are not maintained to distinguish between cases where representations have been made for leave to remain from those where no such representations were made.

The information requested is set out in the attached table. In regard to the number of personnel employed, where there is a vacancy of less than one full post, it is usually the case that such a vacancy arises from a work-sharing arrangement.In October 2001 the Government approved the Report on Civilianisation in An Garda Síochána which recommended a programme of civilianisation to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. In this context, my Department is currently reviewing these figures in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Garda management.The civilianisation report also provides for the transfer of finance functions from the Garda district clerks to civilians, and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The intensification of agriculture over the past half century has led to radical changes in land use, including the loss of the small cereal plots, particularly oats, that used to be grown on most small-holdings for animal feed and thatching. This in turn has resulted in the loss or serious decline of several bird species, notably the corn bunting, now extinct in Ireland as a breeding species, the yellowhammer, the grey partridge and the tree sparrow, and of characteristic plants such as the corn cockle and the cornflower, as well as a wider loss of biodiversity including insects.Between 2000 and 2003, staff of the national parks and wildlife service of my Department piloted a project to address this loss by planting small plots of oats and linseed on State property and managing them for wildlife. The results of these trials were encouraging and, on that basis, a proposal has been put to the Department of Agriculture and Food for inclusion of such plots as an option in the revised REP scheme, with a view to achieving nationwide distribution of these plots.A seminar reviewing the success of the project was held in January 2003, with international participation to enable comparison with similar efforts elsewhere. The proceedings of this seminar will be published shortly and I will arrange for a copy of the publication to be sent to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.My Department has recouped €294 million to Dublin City Council to date in respect of the capital cost of the Dublin Bay wastewater treatment scheme, which includes the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant. The Ringsend plant provides for the wastewater treatment requirements of all of Dublin city and south Dublin, significant areas of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal, and the towns of Ashbourne, Ratoath, Clonee and Dunboyne in County Meath. Meath County Council has an agreement with Fingal County Council for the discharge of wastewater from these towns into Fingal's sewers for onward transmission to the Ringsend plant. The agreement currently provides for a population equivalent, PE, of 6,000 in respect of the Dunboyne-Clonee area.The design capacity approved by my Department under the water services investment programme in respect of the Dunboyne-Clonee sewerage scheme, which was completed in 1999, was 10,000 PE. The actual capacity provided by the scheme would depend on a number of factors, including pipe diameter, gradient and the roughness co-efficient of the type of pipe used. The ongoing greater Dublin strategic drainage study is reviewing the available capacity in all trunk sewers within the Dublin region. On the basis of this information the study will recommend how capacity in the collection network, and at the Ringsend plant, should be assigned between Dublin and neighbouring local authorities.

My Department regrets that a reply has not yet issued, and will rectify the matter. I am happy to facilitate a meeting in this case with the Royal Irish Academy or on other matters of interest to them within the areas of my responsibility, as appropriate.I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 1542 to 1558, inclusive, of 9 October 2002 and my stated view that it would be premature to commit to new legislative or other systematic measures to address light pollution in view of the Government's ongoing priorities in the area of environmental legislation. I note that EU environmental policy is not as yet addressing the issue of light pollution.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The general issue of gazumping was examined by the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in October 1999. Its report examined the practice of taking booking deposits on the sale of new residential properties. The commission found that gazumping occurred in only a handful of cases, less than 5% and almost always on the sale of new houses. It concluded that the current legal position, which does not confer any interest in property upon the payment of a booking deposit, generally benefits the purchaser more than the vendor, allowing the purchaser flexibility to conduct the necessary preliminary investigations before committing to an irrevocable agreement.Among the recommendations of the LRC report was the initiation of, and adherence to voluntary codes of practice among the industry such as the home purchase protection pledge established by the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA.Under the IHBA code of practice, members must not increase the price of the property or accept any offer from any other party for the property for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit, during which time contracts should be exchanged and signed. The code stipulates that IHBA members are only entitled to increase the price of properties in circumstances where VAT rates have changed or as a result of newly enacted legislation that would directly affect the price of a property. In the event of non-compliance by a member of the IHBA in regard to this aspect of the code, the IHBA may take appropriate sanctions against that member.My Department plans to engage with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs during 2004 to consider a range of consumer issues related to housing including gazumping.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 143 and 147 together.The results of the statutory assessment of local authority housing need, which was undertaken by local authorities in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, of which 32,891 were households consisting of two or more persons. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the Housing Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.The Sustaining Progress special initiative on housing and accommodation reflected the Government's expectation that the resources available in 2003 allowed for the needs of about 12,000 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures. A similar level is expected to be achieved again in 2004. This compares with almost 8,500 households in 1998. It is expected that local authorities will commence-acquire some 5,500 units in 2004. This compared with 4,900 starts-acquisitions in 2003.My Department is currently examining individual house building programmes and estimated expenditure requirements for 2004 that have been received from local authorities including the three local authorities in County Kildare. This will enable my Department to determine capital allocations for 2004 for each local authority in the near future.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 148 together.The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. The Government's strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time buyers, and in this way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases.The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply, including significant investment in infrastructure, improving planning capacity and promoting increased residential densities, are having effect. The year 2003 was the ninth record year for completions of houses, with 68,819 units completed, an increase in output of 19.3% on 2002 and an increase of 10.5% in output in the greater Dublin area during the same period. Ireland is building at the fastest rate in Europe — close to 15 units per 1,000 population — which is an outstanding achievement. Indicative data available to the Department show that first-time buyers continue to have a significant presence in the housing market.The Government will continue to focus on measures to maintain a high level of housing supply. The investment in the servicing of land has led to a strong stock of land available for residential development.At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs is met. Almost €3.8 billion was spent in the first three years of the national development plan on social and affordable housing measures, reflecting the strong commitment of the Government to meeting needs of low income groups and those with social and special housing needs. The housing needs of over 12,000 households will be met in 2004 compared to almost 8,500 in 1998. The Government is committed to continuing with measures to boost the supply of housing and ensuring that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable manner.

This is more than double the 1997 State expenditure on non-national roads and represents a substantial increase of almost 10% on last year's initial State grant allocation.I am satisfied that this very significant level of State funding, supplemented by local authorities' own resources, will provide adequately and appropriately for the ongoing maintenance and improvement needs of the non-national road network in 2004.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security of vulnerable older people including personal alarm facilities.The scheme is advertised annually in the national and provincial papers. Applications are invited from local groups to apply on behalf of the older people, people aged 65 and over, in their area. The applications are received and assessed by my Department. Once a group has satisfied all criteria under the scheme, it may be approved for up to 90% of the costs involved. The local group has responsibility for the purchase and installation of the equipment and each group is advised that responsibility for annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not covered under the scheme. It is a matter for the local groups to choose the security supplier which provides greatest value and which meets all the requirements of their clients. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the scheme rules and guidelines, prior to advertising the 2004 scheme in the coming months. The concerns expressed by the Deputy will be taken into account in that review.

My Department's accounts branch was contacted and advised that the cheque had been cashed in the main post office in Carlow on 22 January 2004. In the circumstances the board contacted the gardaí and requested that they investigate the matter.The Deputy will appreciate that the health board has a duty to refer cases such as this to the gardaí so that the circumstances can be fully investigated and the appropriate follow-up action can be undertaken by the board and, if necessary, by the gardaí. The board is awaiting the outcome of the Garda investigation before determining whether or not a replacement cheque can be issued in this case. Obviously the question as to whether any apology may be warranted and, if so, by whom, will also depend on the outcome of the Garda investigation.

However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment to retain a portion of their rent for up to four years subject to a gross household income limit of €317.43 per week, the supplement being retained at 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four.As a participant in community employment a person may opt to be assessed in accordance with the tapered withdrawal system or under standard supplementary welfare allowance rules, whereby up to €50 per week is disregarded, and will be entitled to whichever option is more beneficial.The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that the amount of supplement currently in payment was calculated on the basis of the tapered system outlined above. However, it has now come to light that the standard assessment is more beneficial in this particular case.The board has further advised that the revised amount of rent supplement, and any arrears due, will be put into payment at the earliest opportunity.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Rent supplements are provided for under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.In my reply to a question from the Deputy on 6 November 2003, I advised that rent supplement was paid up to October 2003 at the maximum rate applicable to a lone parent with one child and who had no maintenance payments. In fact, the person concerned had recently given birth to a second child and was in receipt of maintenance payments of €30 per week. At that time neither my Department nor the health board was aware that she had given birth to a second child. The South Western Area Health Board was contacted and a review of the amount of rent supplement in payment was carried out to take account of the additional child and the maintenance payments. As a consequence of this a slightly lower rate of rent supplement was put into payment from November 2003. This was based on her actual income at that time taking into account that she now had two children but was receiving one parent family payment for only one of these and repaying €20 per month of an overpayment incurred some years ago. My Department also undertook a review of her one-parent family payment in view of the change in her circumstances and the person was subsequently awarded the appropriate increased rate of one-parent family payment. The health board will contact the person concerned with a view to reviewing the amount of supplement payable in light of the fact that she is now in receipt of a higher rate of one-parent family payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	577	One-parent family payment was disallowed in this case on the grounds that the person concerned failed to fully disclose her means. There is a statutory obligation on all claimants to satisfy, and continue to satisfy, the conditions for entitlement to payment. The person concerned had income which was not consistent with her declared means and she has failed to explain the discrepancy to date. She was afforded the right of appeal, however, to date there is no record of her having written to the appeals office to appeal the decision.Under social welfare legislation decisions in regard to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
