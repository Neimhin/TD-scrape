            <p eId="para_8">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and thank him for his courtesy in attending the House. The issue before us is a very important one concerning the provision of a primary care centre in Douglas. Given the importance we, as a Government, place on primary care in our health policy, I hope the Government will prioritise the location of a primary care centre in Douglas. There are many suitable locations in this area and the success of other such centres, such as in Carrigaline and in other parts of the city, underscores the importance and need for a primary care centre in Douglas. We have had a number of briefings with the HSE, which highlighted its role in primary care. It is an opportune time to deliver a primary care centre in Douglas with, I might add, a daycare centre for the elderly, but that is a different matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> A national needs assessment was conducted and identified the need for primary care centres in many parts of the city but, in particular, Bishopstown, Togher and Douglas. I hope that today we will get a clear indication from the HSE and the Government that this matter is a priority and that this will be the beginning of the journey to having a primary care centre located in Douglas. As the Minister of State, the Cathaoirleach, Members of the House and those watching the proceedings at home know, we are now living in an expanded Cork city council area, and Douglas has become part of Cork city. This is, therefore, an opportune time to promote the establishment of a primary care centre in Douglas. Douglas is a centre of population which is crying out for a primary care centre. Confusion surrounds the plans and proposals for the primary care centre but we now have an opportunity to bring clarity and certainty and to remove the confusion around the primary care centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for being here and I commend him on the work he is doing in his brief. He is a very progressive and proactive Minister of State. I hope that today we will see the beginning of a new chapter and a good news story for Douglas.</p>

          <speech by="#JimDaly" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">I thank Senator Buttimer for his kind words. As the Senator may be aware, the HSE has responsibility for the provision of primary care centres and other primary care facilities. I am happy to update Senator Buttimer on work being undertaken on the potential provision of a primary care centre in Douglas.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> I understand previous efforts by the HSE to secure a primary care centre in the area have proved unsuccessful because of the high cost of suitable sites for developers. However, I am pleased to be able to advise the Senator that Douglas has been included in a recent advertisement by the HSE seeking expressions of interest from developers for the next tranche of 47 centres to be delivered under the operational lease model. This advertisement was published on 3 May and interested parties had up to the 31 May to make submissions. I understand that all bids have now been submitted to HSE estates centrally and that they are currently being compiled. The bids will issue shortly from estates central office for local assessment by the relevant estates offices in conjunction with local primary care staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> There are a number of distinct phases to be gone through under the operational lease model before a centre can be delivered. After the HSE selects the preferred bidder based on submissions received, a letter of intent issues to that bidder who must then satisfy a number of requirements. Among other things, the bidder must enter into an agreement with GPs to co-locate at the site; provide evidence of ownership or interest in the site; obtain planning permission; and provide evidence that financing for the development is in place. Once these conditions have been satisfied, the HSE signs an agreement for lease with the relevant developer. The HSE will lease the accommodation for the facility which is built to the HSE's specification.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> In the case of Douglas, subject to bids to an acceptable level being submitted, the HSE will issue a letter of intent and the process I have just outlined will begin. However, it is important to note that issues can arise during this process, and there is a risk that delivery of a given centre may not be able to proceed for any one of a number of reasons - for example, where planning may be refused or where GPs do not indicate an interest in co-locating.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The HSE has informed me that all other options for developing a primary care centre in Douglas have been explored but that, regrettably, nothing suitable has been identified and the recent advertisement for expressions of interest is the best way forward. I am advised that, with the exception of community nurses and the home support office, there is no accommodation for other community services in Douglas and that clients must travel to Cork city centre or the nearby Blackrock Hall primary care centre. As a result, the case for developing a centre in Douglas is clear and fully accepted. It would serve a population of approximately 20,000 people and offer services at a single site. This means that people would no longer have to travel to different places for different services, which would save considerable time and expense. Such a centre would undoubtedly enhance and expand capacity in the community sector in Douglas, enabling us to deliver high-quality, integrated care to people in the locality and on the vision for a reformed health service set out under Sláintecare, namely, "the right care, in the right place, at the right time". It is for these reasons that I very much hope that the recent expression of interest for Douglas will generate a positive response.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I welcome the Minister of State's comments and the expression of interest. As he noted, there is now a clear need for a primary centre to be located in Douglas, where there is no accommodation for other community services. I hope the matter will be progressed today.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">As I outlined, a process is under way. At national level, it is clear that the future direction of primary care services will be guided by Sláintecare. We are moving in the right direction by investing in primary care infrastructure, while the expansion of primary care staffing and services was prioritised in the previous Estimates process and the HSE's national service planning. Overall funding for primary care was increased by more than €50 million, which will enable a range of measures to be advanced, including recruitment of additional nursing and therapy staff. I am sure the city and county of Cork will benefit appropriately as these staff are recruited.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Although concerns will always be raised about specific locations, we must not lose sight of the fact that we continue to make good progress in the development and roll-out of primary care centres. There are now 127 such centres, 18 of which became operational in 2018. While I appreciate the Senator's interest in Douglas, I am sure he will be happy to hear that 12 of the operational facilities are in County Cork, as are three of the nine centres expected to open this year, at Carrigtwohill, Bantry and Newmarket. It is also expected that the Beara and Clonakilty centres will become operational in 2020, while a further eight locations are at various stages of planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I reiterate that I hope the latest development round will be successful in attracting developer interest to enable Douglas to join the list. I thank the Senator for putting focus on the matter.</p>

            <from>Senator Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister for his attendance. As the Minister will be aware, a considerable number of people throughout County Mayo are seeking suitable housing, both social and private. From my weekly clinics dealing with people on many housing matters and having had the opportunity to canvass many parts of the county, I know it is an important issue for many people. Having travelled throughout the county, however, I can safely say there are far too many empty houses in towns, villages and rural areas. On the main streets and in the older parts of some such towns and villages, there are many empty houses, which, I am sure the Minister will agree, is a depressing sight. Irrespective of how many social houses are built or how much private house building is encouraged - I welcome the increase in this regard - we cannot ignore empty houses. Something must be done because they will not go away and we do not want them to fall down.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Many such houses have been empty for years. Vacancy is not a recent development. I have observed several examples. Nothing seems to be happening, which is why I asked the Minister to come before the House. Many people look around their towns, villages and the rural areas in which they reside and ask why a particular house has been empty for five, ten or 15 years. It is far too common. I say this notwithstanding the repair-and-lease scheme, the buy-and-renew scheme and all the other initiatives the Minister and his predecessor have put in place to address the issue. It is clear that they have not had the impact we would have liked. In the older parts of a town, there could be a street where one or two elderly people could die and their houses could then be closed up. Similarly, houses in some estates may be caught up with banks or there may be some other reason they are empty. Whatever the reason, the matter should be explored further. Notwithstanding the schemes and the fact that they are advertised by Mayo County Council, there does not seem to be much interest in or take-up of them, which begs the question as to how attractive it is to be a landlord. From conversations with people, I suggest they do not want the hassle or cost. It is not as lucrative as populist media might like to indicate. It is a big responsibility for people who take it seriously and many do not want the hassle.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I acknowledge that Mayo County Council has beefed up its housing section and that despite being busy, it does good work. It has a vacant homes officer and seems to have all the ingredients to address the issue. I would like it to be more proactive, however, in order that there can be results on the ground in respect of the eyesore houses that could be used. They are a valuable resource and using them as part of the liveable housing stock should be a priority. The council needs to assign a technician to go door to door and establish why a house is empty, who owns it and what can be done to bring it back into use. There have to be boots on the ground. Standing back in an office will not sort out the problem. Will the Minister consider all the issues I have raised?</p>

          <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_23">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and giving me an opportunity to set out the extensive range of measures the Government has introduced to allow for the reactivation of long-term vacant residential dwellings into the liveable housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> An overarching action within Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland is a commitment to develop a national vacant housing reuse strategy, which I published in July 2018. The strategy strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy throughout Ireland. My Department and local authorities have been proactive in dealing with vacant properties with all local authorities, having prepared vacant home action plans. In addition, a number of schemes are available to incentivise reactivating appropriate dwellings into the liveable housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> We continually examine new ways of reducing the number of vacant residential dwellings. For example, when the initial national roll-out of the innovative repair-and-lease scheme did not yield the results hoped for, we examined it and made improvements to its terms to make it more desirable to those who wish to bring their vacant property back into use. Correspondingly, the buy-and-renew scheme also has strong potential to purchase and reuse empty dwellings where properties that are suitable for social housing use are available and, therefore, it is a valuable companion to the repair and leasing scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Mayo County Council is committed to utilising the aforementioned schemes. Of the 80 applications made to it in respect of the repair-and-lease scheme, the council is engaging with the owners of 42 properties, while 12 agreements to lease have been signed. Three homes have been completed under buy-and-renew and the council is assessing a further ten homes. Similarly, nine homes have been compulsorily purchased by Mayo County Council in 2019 for housing. Three of these are being considered for progression under the buy-and-renew scheme. Mayo County Council is one of the local authorities that participated in a pilot field survey on vacancy to assess the level of long-term vacant residential homes. Having visually inspected some 1,065 properties in its administrative area, some 61 homes were identified as being vacant over the six-month period of the survey. This equates to a vacancy rate of 5.2%, which is in line with what could be expected to allow churn in a normal housing market. The council will aim to engage with the owners of the 61 homes with a view to getting them reactivated as part of the housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The council has also developed the website <i>vacanthomes.ie</i>, on behalf of the local government sector, to serve as a central portal for individuals anonymously to log possible vacant homes in order that local authorities can follow up with the registered owners. The website has proved a useful tool in aiding local authorities identify vacant homes, with the latest statistics indicating that almost 3,000 properties have been registered on <i>vacanthomes.ie</i> to date. </p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Aside from the reactivation of privately-owned vacant homes, the Department supports the comprehensive maintenance and remediation of local-authority-owned vacant housing stock by way of the voids programme. Since the outset of the programme in 2014, and in addition to its own resources, Mayo County Council has been provided with funding of €1.456 million to bring some 320 vacant homes back to productive use. Some 57 homes, or 2.7% of Mayo County Council's housing stock, are vacant, with 13 currently having a tenancy offered and a further eight due to be the subject of offers in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">Following a call for proposals for 2019, Mayo County Council submitted 32 properties for inclusion in the voids programme seeking funding of €225,000. Allocations for the voids programme are due to issue shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Both centrally and at local level, we are committed to optimising the existing housing stock and, in that context, we will continue to review all initiatives with a view to offering the best supports to those who wish to bring vacant homes back into use.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Minister for his reply. I am glad to note there is some activity. I would be interested in getting more information on the 61 vacant properties the Minister mentioned. I agree the majority of empty houses are privately owned. There are not many long-term voids in the council housing stock. However, I could point to 61 such properties in my town alone, which is only a small part of the county. I do not know from where the council got that figure. Equally, I could point to 61 houses that have been long-term empty. I am not sure how those figures are being calculated. There is no substitute for going door to door, as we have the joy of doing during an election campaign. In that way one could quickly establish there are many empty houses and one could get to the bottom of this. I do not want to be disrespectful about the information provided but I cannot accept there are only 61 private houses vacant in Mayo.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Senator for her follow-up remarks. I hope the information I provided is useful in terms of actual numbers. The reason we can provide that is that we have vacant home action plans for, and vacant home officers in, each of the local authorities. As I said in my initial response, Mayo was involved in this pilot programme. When we get high level numbers around vacancy - we see reports from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and from GeoDirectory - and what we have seen when we have gone in to do the work is that the true level of vacancy has been overstated because of what was counted. In the case of the CSO, it counts summer homes and houses that are for sale or for rent. These types of homes do not speak to the type of vacancy that we are talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> In the six-month period of that survey, there was a series of inspections of each property to make sure they were still vacant in that period. That was a visual inspection of more than 1,000 properties. Not every property was inspected. It would not have included all the homes the Senator might see in her constituency.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Of the 1,000 properties inspected, 61 are what we would consider to be truly vacant homes, which Mayo County Council believes it can bring back into liveable stock. It will engage and do that now, which is important. The council has also received 80 repair and lease applications. That is another 80 vacant homes it can bring back into use, which is separate from the applications it received under buy and renew. Of its own vacant social housing stock, 320 vacant homes requiring the investment of serious money have been brought back into its stock of social housing. There are now 57 homes vacant under the voids programme in Mayo County Council. We will work on a plan for an application for funding for 32 of those homes to bring them back into use with that funding this year. Good progress has been made, although more needs to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> I thank Mayo County Council for setting up the website <i>vacanthomes.ie</i>. It is doing the heavy lifting for the rest of country in allowing members of the public to identify vacant homes on their roads wherever they are based in the county. That information is submitted. People can take a picture of the home on their mobile phone, and it is geo-co-ordinated with the global positioning system, GPS. People will know where the property is and can visually inspect it. This applies to each of the local authorities throughout the country, and they can then determine whether they can bring such properties into their programme, be it under repair and lease, buy and renew, compulsory purchase order, CPO, or another measure. Mayo County Council has developed a very helpful tool and I was very happy to see it do that. Not long after I came into this brief, it stepped forward and it has been leading the way since and I thank it for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I would like to raise three matters, the first of which is the closure of a homeless hostel. The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has informed us of the imminent closure of Brú Aimsire on Thomas Street, which is run by a charity called DePaul Ireland. We want to know whether there will be adequate provision of emergency beds. Where will these people sleep from now on? The hostel is full most evenings and people are worried because they do not know where they will be accommodated. I call for a discussion on this in the House because it is quite worrying for people who rely on homeless hostel services in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The second issue relates to a stabbing last night the Liberties. I raised the issue of knife crime last week. There has been a serious increase in the incidence of knife crime in this city but nothing is being done about it. There was a stabbing on O'Connell Street and two stabbings in Cherry Orchard and then this stabbing last night where a young lady in her 30s was stabbed in her home. This epidemic of knife crime is very concerning but we have done nothing about it. We need to consider offences in regard to the sale, purchase and possession of knives. We need to tackle this issue because it is a growing one. I hope I do not have to raise it again next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The third issue I wish to raise is today's strike by 10,000 health support workers. A further strike is planned for next week. A pay rise has been agreed and it is incumbent on the Government to stand over what it agreed to as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is unfair that these workers must go on strike. Ultimately, it is the patients who are affected by this action. I call on the Minister for Health to be proactive and engage with SIPTU to ensure the strike planned for next week does not go ahead because patients and this country cannot afford any more industrial action in the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I have spoken many times about the Public Service Pay Commission report on the Defence Forces but I have reached the end of my tether. The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, who has no control over public service pay, but who is doing his best to lead his charge, wrote on 20 June 2019 to his charge, that is, to all members of the Defence Forces. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_44">On the 31st of May I informed you that the Public Service Pay Commission report on the Defence Forces would be published in the coming weeks. It is now most likely that the report will be presented to Cabinet for approval <u>next Tuesday, the 25th of June</u>. The report will be made available to all members of the DF at the earliest opportunity after that and its contents and recommendations will need to be studied in detail. It is my intention with the General staff to visit the majority of Barracks and installations after the publication of the report.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_45">Appropriate remuneration and conditions of service for all service personnel are fundamental priorities for the General Staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The representative bodies were told they had to meet the Department of Defence to hear the content of the Public Service Pay Commission's report. Several times over the last month and a half or so, they were told they needed to come in to hear the outcome of the report and yet on each occasion they were told that it would be the following week. Yesterday, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that it was never the intention to release the Public Service Pay Commission report. This has gone beyond a joke. Yesterday, members of the Judiciary received a €12,000 a year pay rise and I do not begrudge them their pay rise. Our Defence Forces are the most loyal citizens of the State and the only citizens of the State who sign away their right to take industrial action and defend this State and yet we treat them like this. Every year Ministers and Taoisigh laud the founders and defenders of this State such as Padraig Pearse, Thomas McDonagh, etc. Maybe it is time we recognised those who gave their life in the service of this State. I intend to read into the record the names of every member of the Defence Forces who has died in overseas service.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">Yes. I wish to address the issue of carers. It is time that we cared for the carers. Some 355,000 people, or one in ten adults, are unpaid carers in Ireland. Only 81,071, or one in five, of those carers receive carer's allowance. They save the State the massive sum of €10 billion each year. The Government spends almost two and a half times more on the nursing home fair deal scheme than it does on carers. The point I am trying to make is that it is time for us to care for the carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> I commend Family Carers Ireland on the launch of its pre-budget submission, which contains very simple requests. The first is to reform the means test for carer's allowance. It has not been reformed since 2008. There has been no change in the disregards and the allowable deductions are too limited. This means that many people do not meet the means test for carer's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> We need to give consideration to the fact that carer's allowance is taxable. We do not tax vulture funds or multinational companies and banks are getting away without paying tax for 20 years, but we tax carer's allowance. That must be examined and changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Another matter that need to be changed is the restriction of 15 hours a week in respect of carers who work, take up a course in education or engage in voluntary work. That must be extended to at least 18.5 hours per week. We must value our carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> We need to end the postcode lottery in regard to home care and carer supports. In my county of Mayo, we do not have the home care or carer supports that exist in other areas of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> We also need to replace the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant which were withdrawn in 2013. There is no reason these measures should not be brought back in, particularly for people living in rural areas who must travel long distances to hospital and for medical supports since the centralisation of such supports. In addition, the GP visit card should be extended to include carers in receipt of a carer's support package.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">I ask that the Minister be asked to come to the House for a meaningful debate on how we treat our 355,000 unpaid carers in this State.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">We should have that debate. The Labour Party will propose a motion in the Dáil later this evening regarding additional supports for carers. I hope that the House will unite behind that proposal, which includes many of the propositions outlined in Senator Conway-Walsh's contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> The spin that we have seen over the last couple days in particular from Fine Gael on today's hospital workers strike has been remarkable. There has been a common thread and a common pattern running through the contributions of Fine Gael backbenchers over the last couple of days and a succession of Fine Gael cannon fodder has been marched through the doors of various television and radio studios over the last two or three days, claiming that the strike is SIPTU's fault and that, to use the word referenced by the Minister for Health yesterday, it is "extraordinary" that the dispute has not been referred to the Labour Court and that health workers across the country are having their pay restored. These kinds of phrases display a remarkable ignorance of what this particular health dispute is about. Fine Gael is deliberately muddying the waters in this regard. This is not about pay restoration. Rather, it is about the implementation of a solemn deal and a job evaluation review process that was carried out in the context of the existing public sector pay agreement and within the architecture of successive public sector pay agreements. This is essentially about ensuring that our healthcare assistants, porters, chefs and other critical support staff grades across our hospital service are given just reward for the work they do. Their roles were independently and objectively assessed by experts in this field. A deal was done with the Department of Health and the HSE and now the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, is withholding the moneys that are legitimately owed to those healthcare staff. It is pathetic that Fine Gael has chosen to pick a fight with the lowest paid workers in our health service in order to re-establish its damaged reputation in terms of its management of the public finances. It is telling. This morning, I spent some time on the picket line at Louth County Hospital in Dundalk and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, supporting the stance that low paid health workers have been forced to take in a bid to have their rights vindicated. This is a classic upstairs-downstairs type scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> There is another upstairs-downstairs type scenario of which I was made aware yesterday. I do not necessarily want to identify the individual, but I know that she is happy for me to do so. A colleague of mine, a newly elected councillor in Drogheda, Councillor Michelle Hall, who represents the Drogheda rural electorate, works as a special needs assistant in Aston Village Educate Together school in Drogheda. She has learned through the school, her union and the Department of Education and Skills that unlike teachers she is not entitled to ten unpaid leave days to attend to her public duties. This is unfair and discriminatory. Fine Gael believes that only doctors and nurses are important in the context of the health service and it likewise believes that only principals and teachers matter in the context of the education system. This is unfair and discriminatory and it needs to be corrected. The Minister needs to respond to this issue immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I reject what has been said by Senator Nash. Fine Gael worked very closely with the Labour Party in a very difficult time. The Labour Party and Fine Gael helped to rescue this country. Senator Nash's comments are not representative of what I believe. We will agree to differ.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> As Chairman of Committee A of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I mentioned yesterday that the committee visited various locations in Northern Ireland and the Republic in the context of its study on illicit trade between Ireland and the UK along the Border in the context of Brexit. There is a particular issue that we need to address, namely, counterfeit goods. A lot of work was done to develop the marker to eliminate washed diesel used, in the main, by paramilitaries or subversive groups. While this practice has been dealt with those involved are cunning, professional smugglers and they have now moved into washing powder, alcohol, meat processing and cheap whites, namely, cigarettes. People who buy these goods need to be mindful of workers' rights, workplace conditions and product origin. These products, in particular the washing powder and cheap whites, are dangerous and the proceeds finance drug gangs and gun crime. We need an information campaign. People who holiday in Spain and so on and purchase counterfeit designer handbags and football jerseys and so on from salespeople along the beach front need to be made aware that they are funding criminal activity. We need to wake up and recognise that these products are not good value. Rather, they are bad produce, the proceeds of which is funding criminal gangs. We need an information campaign or a debate on this very serious issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I rise today to raise the issue of electric vehicle charging points, but not the lack of same or the need for more. I have been contacted by a number of people who recently invested in electric vehicles in regard to their inability to access charging points, particularly in rural areas and small villages, as non-electric vehicles are being parked or abandoned in front of them. This is happening in rural areas in particular where there is no paid parking and hence no parking wardens. There is nobody policing the charging points. This issue needs to be raised with the relevant Department. There is need for additional signage at electric vehicle charging points and increased penalties or fines for those who park in front of them. One can imagine the frustration of an electric vehicle owner who, when the battery is almost dead, arrives at a charging point to find a three litre diesel car parked in front of it, which means he or she cannot access it or continue on his or her journey. There is nobody policing charging points in small towns in rural areas where there is no paid parking. I ask the Deputy Leader to raise this issue with the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> If the people who raised this issue with me are speaking to other people about this matter they are probably speaking negatively about electric vehicles, thereby deterring those who might be considering purchasing an electric vehicle from doing so. As we are all aware, this is the direction in which we have to go. The charging points are limited enough. If they are not accessible, this is another black mark against purchasing an electric vehicle. They need to be policed in the areas I have mentioned, although I admit I do not know how this can be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">I welcome the report on the future of the beef sector in the context of Food Wise 2025. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to be commended on its diligent work and dedication to the production of this report. However, as detailed and referenced in the report, it is not a silver bullet for the industry. No one solution exists to protect the fortunes and futures of those involved in this industry. All involved, including the farming fraternity, the processors, the industry bodies and the Government, have a responsibility and a part to play. The report makes recommendations with regard to unfair trading practices, market information, exports, pricing, CAP support, added value and research funding, all of which are important and relevant. There is a special acknowledgement of the significant threat posed by the prospective EU-Mercusor free trade agreement and the unintended consequences and detrimental impact, potentially, it could have of undercutting Irish beef with the importation of cheaper beef into the European market.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> The importance of the Irish beef sector cannot and must not be understated for the socioeconomic benefits it presents for rural Ireland. The importance of retaining people on the land and ensuring that this sector is truly sustainable on economic, environmental and social grounds is paramount, not alone for the rural economy but the entire Irish economy, urban and rural. My concern is that there is no recognition of costs of production and efficiency. We must acknowledge that some businesses are not sustainable if beef is at €6 per kilo. The stark reality is that it will not be that price. The market is the market. The Government must ensure mechanisms are in place to establish cost of production modelling and seek to assist farmers in understanding cutting cost production, maximising efficiencies and maximising profits from a technical farming perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Let us focus on the things a farming business has control of rather than all of the aspects over which they have no influence. Vertical integration of a supply chain and the sharing of risk and rewards across the supply chain must be discussed. The supply chain must become a value chain adding value at every point.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Reports and recommendations are one thing but this must be with implementation and delivering impact. This report is only a starting point to build a sustainable beef industry with support mechanisms, market awareness and sustainability at its core. The committee, with the Minister, now have responsibility to ensure that targets relating to the food sector are set out in Food Wise 2025 and are delivered as part of a sustainable and profitable industry with farmers and their families central to the conversation.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I compliment the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for organising the all-Ireland food fair to which we were all invited last week in the Members' Restaurant. It was a treat for the senses and the food was absolutely fantastic. I particularly want to single out the Mayo Mountain Blackface Sheep Breeders group who were represented on that occasion by Pat Chambers of Newport and Peter Chambers, who is involved with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is a fantastic success story with a lot more potential. It is a producer group from the west of Ireland with 350 members who sell premium breeding stock and factory lambs. The group works with the Kildare Chilling Company to supply finished lambs. This business has grown from processing 2,000 lambs in 2012 to processing 25,000 lambs in 2018. This means a great and fantastic deal to the local economy. It encompasses a great geographical spread in Mayo including the Nephin Beg wilderness on the Wild Atlantic Way and from Toormakeady to Bangor Erris. There is a lot of species-rich grassland there upon which this particular breed of blackface sheep roam. I believe this to be a unique selling point. This is the way our primary producers need to go to maximise the value for their product. I also compliment the South West Mayo Development Company and the rural social scheme there, along with the breeders and the group secretary, Breege Biggins. It is a real success story that I wanted to highlight. They have a product they can stand over and they need support in promotion so they can go further afield. I sincerely hope they get that.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I wish to speak about this morning's strike that was commenced by health service staff and workers, as Senator Nash has already referred to. We are aware from different strikes in the health services that the spin from the Government and the Department gives a sense that workers and unions just strike for the craic of it and go to the gates and discommode a lot of people, including themselves, their families, patients and those on waiting lists. This, however, is quite false or as a Trumpian would say it is "fake news". It is not as simple as just saying that the Workplace Relations Commission is available. The Department has reneged on an agreement that was made in 2017 for these 10,000 workers for job evaluations and an agreement and a price was put on the cost of that decision. I was with health service workers at the gates of St. James's Hospital this morning and I give a shout out to Patricia Slattery who organised that strike. Workers such as these are the engine rooms of hospitals. The nurses and doctors are seen as the more visible face of hospital staff but these 10,000 health service workers are in the engine rooms providing essential services for our patients. They are marching but it is not for the good of their own health. They are looking to strike also over two or three days next week seeking only the implementation of what has already been decided. As Senator Nash has said, this is not a new pay claim. It is a claim that has been hanging over health service staff for years. Government inaction has made it sound as though these workers are greedy and the bogey guys, but this is not the case. These workers need what is rightly due to them. They are workers on modest wages who work in the engine rooms of our hospitals and health services.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">The position I am quite clearly stating is that people earning under €30,000 have had their pay restored and it is now 4% above the 2009 pay level. That has not occurred in other sectors of the HSE. This is the first point.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> My second point is that an additional 13,000 whole-time equivalent, WTE, staff were taken on in the HSE in the last four years in order to assist and make sure we can continue to deliver the same level of care or an increased level of care. There are now 135,000 people working in the HSE. There were 103,000 WTE workers and that has now gone up to 116,000 whole-time equivalent staff in four years, which is a huge pay cost of some €600 million per annum of additional cost. With regard to the situation we are discussing, yes an evaluation was carried out and yes it needs to be implemented, and the Government is quite clearly saying it will start to implement it from November. There are other issues that need to be resolved and the Government is quite prepared to go back into conciliation on those issues and has made its position quite clear. Let us not go back to the period between 2000 and 2008 when public sector pay went from €8 billion per annum to €16 billion per annum and then-----</p>

What is the point of these things if the Government does not live up to it? Consider the jobs being done by these workers. I have a friend who works in a Dublin hospital and there is intimate contact such as taking patients to the lavatory, assisting people in the evacuation of bowels and showering people. They administer to them in all of these ways. Health services workers do a very remarkable job. There is a two-tier system where the judges get their pay. The increase for some judges is as much as the annual income of some low-paid workers.</p>

One clear example is where somebody who has a visual impairment, who is not deemed to be legally blind but is medically unable to drive a car, does not get a free travel pass simply because he or she does not meet the criteria of being legally blind.</p>

Why is the union not prepared to do that? I would like it to give a definitive answer to that because it is appalling.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I support my colleague, Senator Conway, and remind people that the NCBI is in Buswells Hotel. It does important work and needs our support. I support my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, and reassure him that this does not just affect rural Ireland. Last Wednesday, I was in Malahide and the only available space for an electric car that I could find was occupied by a non-electric car. The same thing happens in Leinster House, where we have two spaces and one was occupied by a non-electric car.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> However, I really rise to speak about Brexit and the fact that we may face a very hard Brexit. I call on the Minister for Finance to give consideration to the following. By way of background, Charlie Weston in the <i>Irish Independent</i> talked about the Irish credit unions having €17 billion on deposit but only being able to lend out €4.5 billion. That is a 27% loan to assets ratio which, in any normal institution, would be 50%. <i>The Irish Times</i> reported this month that credit unions are now restricting members' deposits, primarily because the credit unions cannot put that money to work via prudent loans. In October 2018, at the invitation of the 200 year old public bank in Germany, called Sparkasse, which I have raised numerous times here, I visited its headquarters and banking academy where it trains bankers. It has its own university to do that. Its successful, sustainable banking model has worked for more than 200 years, including through two world wars, economic downturns and serious recessions. The bank is available to assist local regions. It has a long tradition of real banking, not just based on turning over property and profits. It is an old-style bank whose staff go to visit a person at a business or farm, assess risks and ability to pay, and support a person through the rough as well as good times.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I call on the Minister for Finance to urgently review the case for setting up a pilot scheme for this bank in the midland counties and in Fingal, County Dublin, to assist businesses with the challenge of Brexit. We need to provide credit to businesses in difficult times at reasonable rates. In the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation's report on the cost of doing business, the cost and availability of credit were two of the main challenges that businesses faced with regard to sustainability. Sparkassen could perhaps partner with credit unions or at least be allowed to come in. The report, which is good, has been with the Minister for quite a while and we should act. He needs to come to the House and tell us what he will do. By his own admission, he has two budget scenarios. One is for a hard Brexit, which will put this country in serious jeopardy, and we will need finance to sustain our people.</p>

The Government has launched a draft marine planning policy statement. It is important that we have a cohesive, coherent marine planning strategy relating to development. I encourage Members to engage in the public consultation. If they represent coastal communities, they might take it up with their communities and ask them to engage. The public consultation is now open but the period will close on Friday, 9 August 2019, at midday.

          <p eId="para_168">My colleague, Senator Craughwell, proposed an amendment to the Order of Business relating to the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission report. As the defence spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, I fully agree that this report is long overdue and should be published as a matter of urgency. However, Senator Craughwell is correct that we need the Taoiseach, who is personally responsible for the Defence Forces, to attend, not the Minister of State. This is too serious an issue. I ask the Deputy Leader that within the next week, and certainly before the summer recess, the Taoiseach should come to the House and outline the contents of this report which I believe and agree should be published. Morale is at an all-time low within the Defence Forces and it is time that their concerns about pay, conditions and allowances are dealt with urgently. It is long overdue but I think that we should wait until the Taoiseach is available to come in here himself. Frankly, the Minister of State is not acceptable to me as the defence spokesperson. He is the Minister of State but we need the man who has the responsibility to come in here and answer questions when he is available.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">We are in fine voice today. Many issues were raised on the Order of Business. Senator Ardagh raised the hostel on Thomas Street. The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, has been using the Brú Aimsir hostel temporarily since 2016. The hostel operates on a one-night only basis and has been accommodating 105 individuals. That property was always available temporarily to Dublin County Council from the Digital Hub Development Agency. The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive works continuously to ensure there is adequate emergency supply. The facility will close on 27 June. However, 120 new beds will be provided to replace those previously provided at this facility and by 10 July, the DRHE will increase the supply of emergency beds by 45, meaning that 165 new beds will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The majority of the new beds being put in place - approximately 95 - are supported temporary accommodation. The Senator will be pleased to hear that nobody in Brú Aimsir will be left without accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> We all regret the stabbing in the Liberties area and we all want to avoid crime. The Government remains committed to a vigorous and comprehensive response to knife crime in our cities and generally. A comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place in respect of knife crime, including heavy penalties for a breach of the law concerned. An Garda Síochána has an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons. This is an important issue, especially in Dublin, where many of these crimes are occurring. It could certainly be debated in the House in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Many Senators raised the strike by HSE workers. The dispute began at 8 a.m. and will have a significant impact on 38 hospital healthcare facilities from today. I support the comments made by Senators Burke and Conway who noted that €17 billion is now being allocated to the health service, the highest such allocation in the history of the State. We all differ on various aspects of this issue but I encourage all parties to go to the Labour Court. The court was established to deal with cases such as these and I am at a loss to understand why it is not being used. An additional 300,000 people have been taken on in the health service, which adds a huge cost to the bottom line of the HSE. Genuine efforts have been made by the Government and I encourage all involved to go to the Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces. The Taoiseach will not come to the House to speak on this issue as he has had a bereavement. We will arrange a debate on the impact of the Public Service Pay Commission report on the Defence Forces as soon as possible. It was never officially stated that the report would be published this week. The Minister of State stated today that it will be available next week. The issue has been raised in this House on numerous occasions, not least by Senators Craughwell, McFadden and Wilson. Given that it has been raised for nearly a year, taking another few days to get it right should not make a difference and it will be before the House next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Senator Conway-Walsh raised the important issue of carers. Family Carers Ireland has made many laudable suggestions in its pre-budget submission and I expect the Minister for Finance will take many of them on board in advance of the budget. We will receive many pre-budget submissions in the coming weeks. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I addressed the issue raised by Senator Nash. On the issue of teachers, it is worth noting that the Government has significantly increased the number of special needs assistants.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">Given that the matter relates to a particular individual, perhaps the Senator will raise it as a Commencement motion in order to get a satisfactory direct response from the Minster.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Senator Feighan raised the important issue of smuggling, some of which was news to me. An information campaign would be a very good idea and I hope it would be feasible. I commend the Senator on raising the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I completely agree with Senators Paul Daly and Reilly that we should come down hard on individuals who choose to park in spaces reserved for charging electric vehicles. Such behaviour is very irritating for people who need to recharge their car battery, especially as we are trying to encourage the use of electric vehicles. It is more challenging to use electric vehicles than other vehicles and every measure should be put in place to encourage their use. This issue should be considered in the context of a debate on the environment or as a Commencement matter. It is certainly a valid issue and one on which most Senators would agree with Senators Paul Daly and Reilly.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Marshall raised the important report on the future of the beef sector, which has been facilitated by Members of this House who sit on the agriculture committee. We all want a sustainable beef sector and I commend colleagues on the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Mulherin commended the Houses of the Oireachtas on the food event held here last week. I was unable to attend but there was much positive feedback from the event, if Senators will pardon the pun. I am sure the Mayo Mountain Blackface Sheep Breeders will go from strength to strength and the event rightly highlighted the group's great achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senator Colm Burke spoke about the strike by HSE workers and made many of the points I have already alluded to.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">That is a welcome development and it is important that a rainbow flag has been presented to the Ceann Comhairle. I understand Senator Buttimer has led on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Senator Conway noted that representatives of the National Council for the Blind Ireland will be in Buswells Hotel today to outline their pre-budget hopes and expectations. As many Senators as possible should interact with them on their ongoing work.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Senator Reilly eloquently outlined the financial issues arising from Brexit. The report to which he referred cannot be highlighted enough as it is extremely important. We cannot debate Brexit enough and I expect we will have a further debate on it before the end of term because the time available for discussing the issue in the new term will be tight. Much of the Senator's contribution would be very valid in any such debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Senator Boyhan highlighted the marine planning policy statement. No more than the beef sector, we all want to see a cohesive plan when it comes to our marine and wildlife. The public consultation aspect of this issue is very important to highlight.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Senator Wilson raised the same issue as Senator Craughwell. As I mentioned, the Taoiseach will not be in position to come to the House today and I do not believe the Senator expected him to do so. A debate will be arranged on the impact of the report in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I acknowledge the support of Senators since Second Stage. This is a complex Bill, as they will have noted, but it has a straightforward purpose, namely, to allow a person who has been placed under the supervision of the probation service in one EU member state but who lives in another to return home and undergo his or her further supervision here, or there, depending on the circumstances, provided the person's consent is forthcoming. I emphasise that a person cannot be transferred from one country to another without his or her consent as it would discourage compliance and rehabilitation, which would have the effect of undermining the proposal. The proposals in the Bill will increase the chances of social reintegration of offenders by ensuring that the probation measures imposed on a person can be followed up on and he or she can be supervised in the country in which he or she resides. This will allow the offender to: maintain ties with family and community; in some circumstances, to continue in employment or education; and to relate to the support services in his or her home country, all of which are important in the context of rehabilitation and reintegration.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Successful reintegration reduces the risk of reoffending, which improves the protections for both victims and society. The Bill better protects society by improving the compliance framework for probation conditions and reduces unnecessary detention of non-resident offenders by ensuring the enforcement of non-custodial sentences in the person's home state. This Bill, when enacted, will not affect too many people, but for the small number it will affect, it will have a considerable impact on their lives and for that reason, it is important legislation. I thank Members for ensuring its concluding Stages were taken this afternoon before our summer recess.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation and the officials in his Department for the work they did on it. It is important that we recognise judgments from other countries and that the same recognition is given to Irish judgments elsewhere in order to ensure the decisions of the courts are implemented regardless of the country in which someone is residing. It is an important step, particularly from an Irish point of view, given the number of people living here who have come from abroad. They may wish to travel home and we need to make sure penalties imposed by the Probation Service are followed through in full. I thank the Minister and the Department for bringing forward this legislation, and I hope it is passed into law as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_253">This series of amendments relates to the adjournment of an inquest and the coroner's obligation to direct a post mortem examination in a case where criminal proceedings are either under consideration or have been initiated into the death of the person concerned. Section 25 of the principal Act, as Senators will be aware, already provides that the coroner shall adjourn the inquest on request of a Garda officer of rank not less than inspector in either of the following situations. The first is where the request is on the grounds that criminal proceedings are being considered. Section 25(1) provides that: "the coroner shall adjourn the inquest for such period as he thinks proper and shall further adjourn the inquest for similar periods so often as a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector requests him on the ground aforesaid so to do." The second is where the request is on the grounds that criminal proceedings have been instituted. Section 25(2) provides that "the coroner shall adjourn the inquest until such proceedings have been finally determined".</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The group of amendments I am introducing makes provision for an adjournment along identical lines where the lead investigating agency regarding any criminal proceedings in relation to the death of a person is not An Garda Síochána, but the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. This will only arise in a limited number of cases. The amendments specify that the Defence Forces are the lead investigating agency only where the death is that of a person who is subject to military law, under the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015. This will be the case for members of the Defence Forces who die while in active service, or in service custody. </p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The amendments also specify that GSOC is the lead investigating agency only where there is a GSOC investigation under Part 4 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 into the death in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">That is provided for in the definition of "relevant Ombudsman Commission investigation" contained in section 2 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Section 18 inserts a new section 33A into the principal Act, making more comprehensive and detailed provision on the categories of deaths where the coroner has a duty to direct a post mortem examination. That section already makes mandatory provision for a post mortem examination in cases where An Garda Síochána, or the Defence Forces or GSOC as lead investigating agency, so requests. I am proposing to make several amendments to section 18 to refer more precisely to the scope of Defence Forces and GSOC investigations and for consistency with the other amendments in this grouping.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Section 40(3) of the principal Act provides that the coroner is not obliged to empanel a jury for an inquest sitting at which a Garda officer of rank not lower than inspector will apply for adjournment on the grounds that criminal proceedings into the death concerned are being considered or have already been instituted. These amendments make changes to section 40(3) to avoid an obligation to empanel a jury unnecessarily, where the adjournment is requested by an appropriate officer of the Defence Forces or of GSOC in the small range of cases where that body, and not An Garda Síochána, is the lead investigating agency. The amendments reflect existing practice, but it is preferable to make express statutory provision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Amendment No. 2 is the most substantial amendment in this grouping. It amends section 25 of the principal Act to provide that the coroner shall adjourn an inquest on the request of an appropriate officer of the Defence Forces or of GSOC in the specific range of deaths where either of those bodies is the lead investigating agency under statute and is considering criminal proceedings in respect of the death or such proceedings have been instituted.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">This is an important and substantive amendment which inserts into the Bill a new power for a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on any doubtful or difficult point of law arising in the exercise of his or her functions. While coroners normally determine questions of fact, difficult questions of law do arise occasionally on a range of issues relating to the exercise of their functions. Such issues might, for example, include the procedural rights of interested parties at inquest or the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights on a new or difficult issue. Currently, coroners have no legal avenue to seek direction from the courts on such points of law. The main avenue of clarification is judicial review proceedings, which have to be taken by an interested party rather than by the coroner.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> For these reasons, coroners strongly support and have long sought a case-stated facility. The text used here is similar to the consultative case-stated procedure used in section 4A of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997, as inserted by section 3 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2004<i>, </i>and in the Coroners Bill 2007. It is a special provision which is to be used at the discretion of the coroner. Interested parties at inquest will continue to be entitled to seek judicial review if, in their view, a coroner has made a wrong decision as a matter of law. The case-stated provision has a different purpose. It is there to enable coroners to seek guidance from the High Court on a difficult or unexplored point of law relating to the exercise of their functions. I do not expect that it will need to be used frequently, but I do expect that it will be used judiciously by coroners from time to time. As such, it will greatly assist in clarifying and developing our coronial law. I ask Senators to support this important amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">These amendments insert into the Bill a further provision for situations where a designated GSOC officer is assisting the coroner, in place of a garda, in a death which is also the subject of a GSOC investigation under Part 4 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. Section 33 of the Bill already inserts a new section 101A into the 2005 Act to make express provision for a GSOC designated officer to perform the assistance functions expressly set out for a garda in the Coroners Act 1962 and provide such other assistance to the coroner as would normally be provided by a garda in regard to the inquest.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The proposed amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, add a new subsection to a new section 101A of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to add, for the avoidance of any doubt, that while performing such functions or providing such assistance, the GSOC designated officer continues to have all the powers, immunities and privileges, and all the duties and obligations of a member of An Garda Síochána, whether statutory or common law. Such immunities and privileges should be expressly provided to avoid any possible risk of purely technical legal defects in the officer, for example, entering on private property to serve a summons. I ask for support for the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment. Amendment No. 12 is the substantive amendment in this grouping. As I have already outlined, it adds a new subsection to a new section 101A of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to add, for the avoidance of any doubt, that while performing statutory functions of assistance to the coroner’s inquiry into a death or otherwise assisting the coroner in relation to the inquest into that death in place of a garda, a GSOC designated officer will have all the powers, immunities and privileges enjoyed by a member of An Garda Síochána, whether statutory or common law. Again, I ask that the amendment be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> For the benefit of Senators, in particular Senator Ó Donnghaile who raised this matter, I have a small number of further amendments which are being finalised, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, and which I hope to table on Report Stage. These include a possible provision to extend the retirement age of coroners from 70 to 72 years; a possible further administrative updating of provisions regarding, in particular, the Dublin coroner district; and a provision setting out general rules and guiding principles for the making of detailed regulations on appropriate and respectful treatment of human tissue or organs removed for post mortem or inquest. I am keen that we move to Report Stage next week and I do not expect that there will be any delay in finalising these decisions. The amendments will be circulated in advance of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">Amendment No. 1 is to provide for the inclusion of tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation within the scope of the Bill. On the application of the offence of perjury and related offences, the legal advice I have received indicates that those particular forms of proceedings are not involved in the administration of justice <i>per se</i>. One possible problem with the Bill, therefore, is that it appears to define a proceeding as primarily involving the administration of justice and then states that this includes tribunals. A question might arise if this formula includes tribunals of inquiry as well as decision-making tribunals. A tribunal of inquiry or commission of investigation does not administer justice. They are concerned exclusively with the finding of facts. I am proposing, therefore, with the consent of Senator Ó Céidigh and others, that the definition of judicial or other proceedings is revised for the purposes of this Bill to remove the reference to administration of justice and to include the tribunals of inquiry as well as decision-making tribunals within its defined legal meaning. If we adopt this amendment, it will effectively broaden the scope in which a statutory offence of perjury may be prosecuted. Broadening the scope of this legislation such that perjury may be statutorily prosecuted, both within fact-finding courts and tribunals as well as in tribunals of inquiry, is a laudable objective in pursuit of fact-finding, truth and honesty across all forms of official legal proceedings. I trust that Senator Ó Céidigh has no difficulty with this amendment and I welcome his support.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">The purpose of this amendment is to bring the penalties provision in this Private Members' Bill in line with those of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which, <i>inter alia</i>, stipulates penalty levels for false evidence and fraudulent claims. I propose to amend the relevant section of this Bill rather than that of the 2004 Act in terms of the maximum penalty on indictment for this type of offence because the 2004 Act reflects Government policy in this jurisdiction. There is the question of the changing value of money over time, given that it has been 15 years since the 2004 Act came into force. I am satisfied to specify the amount of €100,000 for the purpose of proposing an amendment to this section. The penalty provision as it stands provides for a coherence within the equivalent penalties provided for in Northern Ireland in terms of the maximum penalty on indictment. It is somewhat more important and appropriate to ensure consistency of provisions in this jurisdiction. Assuming this amendment is passed, the maximum penalty on indictment for which a person may be liable on conviction under this legislation is, therefore, imprisonment for a term of ten years, a fine of €100,000 or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> The purpose of this amendment is to send a clear message to would-be abusers of court time that the utterance of deliberate falsehoods and the making of false statements during legal proceedings will, if proven, not go unpunished and may result in very serious consequences for the individual concerned. I am confident that this measure will go a long way towards deterring those who may be considering providing dishonest evidence in the course of legal proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">This is a very big day for me. During my time in the Seanad, I have sometimes asked whether I am really making a contribution, although I give it my best shot. I suppose that is human nature. The Bill is the culmination of a personal journey. It shows how sometimes, even without power, resources or the backing of a Department or the Attorney General, good laws can be formulated by individuals. It shows the importance of the Upper House and validates the work that Senators McDowell, Norris and others have done to protect its relevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> We are fortunate to have the support of some excellent drafters. I availed of this support and I especially thank Kieran Mooney for his contribution to the creation of this robust Bill. The journey focused on a number of significant stakeholder consultations. I reached out to the Minister and I greatly appreciate his very active support for the Bill. I thank An Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Law Reform Commission, the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Rape Crisis Centre, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, Victim Support and others. ISME in particular put the prospect of placing perjury on a statutory footing firmly on the public agenda. I pay tribute to the campaign it ran on behalf of its members, many of whom are penalised through high insurance premiums precisely because of perjury being committed within and outside the jurisdiction of our courts. Up to now, there have been virtually no prosecutions in respect of this crime. In the past ten years, there have only been 31 recorded incidents of perjury in our courts. Placing perjury on the Statute Book is not just about penalising those who commit perjury. It is primarily about preventing them from doing it in the first instance. That is a big motivator for changing the sentence from seven to ten years. Tough sanctions may make someone think twice about lying and subverting the course of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I hope the Bill will have a practical impact on business, especially small businesses. Over the years, I have personally known scores of small business owners who have suffered significantly because someone knowingly lied in court. In some cases, their businesses went under as a direct result of people committing perjury. My initiative to place perjury on a statutory footing as a criminal offence is not just about addressing fraudulent personal injury claims, although it is a very important component. It is about bringing accountability to all those who lie in our courts, commissions and tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I wish to pay special tribute to the two officials seated behind the Minister, who have worked very actively with me, my team and my personal assistant, Cáit Nic Amhlaoibh, in bringing this Bill to fruition. Anyone who has the misfortune of facing into court proceedings or giving jury service knows that every day of the week there are people taking oath or swearing an affidavit stating facts that they know to be false. As a nation, we have endured multiple tribunals and commissions of inquiry that have taken place while knowing that people have lied.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">In some cases, we discovered years later that blatant lies materially affected the course of justice without any consequences for the liar. There are people guilty of heinous crimes such as assault, sexual assault, robbery and extortion walking our streets because somebody went into court and lied on their behalf. Unfortunately, the innocent parties in such circumstances suffered greatly. I hope that such suffering will be significantly reduced as a result of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I wish to thank my Independent colleagues, our researcher, Mr. James Geoghegan, and the departmental officials. We are privileged to have such good and committed civil servants in the Department. It gives me great confidence in the Department of Justice and Equality and in the Minister, as its head, in regard to the Bill. I thank the members of all political parties and none who have supported the Bill. I deeply appreciate it. I hope that our colleagues in the Dáil will pass this much-needed legislation in order that the President can sign it into law. I appreciate the cross-party support for the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018.</p>

          <p eId="para_295"> I wish to acknowledge the deterrent effect of the legislation. It will act as a bulwark against vexatious and dishonest evidence. It is likely to be a very welcome development, particularly in regard to the cost of insurance, as has been stated. It is part of a package of measures dealing with insurance issues such as fraud and exaggerated claims. Of course, it will also have a more general application. It is a clear message to anybody engaged in legal proceedings that they need to be mindful of the need to tell the truth at all times and that any deliberate departure from the truth may have serious consequences in terms of the level of sanctions and penalties which may be imposed at the discretion of the judge or court should that be deemed appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> I again acknowledge the leadership of Senator Ó Céidigh in particular as the main sponsor of the Bill and, indeed, the members of his background team. In particular, he mentioned Mr. James Geoghegan - now Councillor James Geoghegan - who I thank for his efforts on the Bill and his influence over the Independent Group-----</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I wish to add my words of congratulations to Senator Ó Céidigh on taking the initiative to start the process which led to the Bill passing through the House. When he came to our Independent Group with this proposal, it seemed to me that he faced a number of insurmountable odds, but he has, by his industry and persistence, brought all the parties in the House with him. He brought the Government, the Minister, the Department of Justice and Equality and many bodies in civil society on board as well. It is a great tribute to him that he has had this success and I warmly congratulate him on his achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> As he and the Minister stated, there must be consequences for perjury. There has been a period during which, on the face of it, many offences of perjury have been committed without sanction. The great advantage of what the Senator has achieved is that he has extended the prosecutable category of perjury on a clear statutory basis to tribunals of inquiry, commissions of inquiry and other tribunals where, as we have seen shocking deception has previously taken place, apparently without consequence. That is a sad fact borne out by the Moriarty report, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> It is one thing to enact a law; it is another to prosecute for a breach of that law. I hope that the Department, which has an overarching role in this matter, will bring to the attention of An Garda Síochána in particular that this is a serious offence and that resources must be made available when instances become apparent for its proper investigation and prosecution. As Senator Ó Céidigh stated, some people who have small businesses and are not insured can be put out of business and made bankrupt by a lie, even if they have CCTV footage to back up their side of the story. Their businesses and livelihoods and their families' livelihoods are put in peril by such behaviour and mendacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> I again warmly congratulate the Senator on his courage, initiative, persistence and success in bringing the Bill before the House. I thank the Minister, his departmental officials and all the other people who have been mentioned, including Councillor Geoghegan, for all of their influence, to use the Minister's phrase, as well as their co-operation and goodwill in getting the Bill passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">I concur with fellow Senators and congratulate Senator Ó Céidigh on the Bill. It is interesting because it highlights a couple of things, as the Senator indicated, such as the importance of this House and the ability to move this type of legislation. It also highlights the importance of the fact that legislation needs to move with the times as something that was not a problem a few years ago has become a very significant problem. The current culture and climate of litigation and claims makes the Bill even more relevant and appropriate. I applaud the Senator for his endurance, tenacity and persistence. There were obstacles but, as he stated, the Bill received cross-party support. Congratulations to all those involved, including the Minister and the staff and officials who worked on the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh. Ní rud furasta é a leithéid de reachtaíocht a chur tríd an Teach, fiú mar bhall de pháirtí polaitíochta, agus ní rud éasca é do Sheanadóir neamhspleách ach go háirithe. Ta sé déanta ag an Seanadóir go héifeachtach, mar atá ráite. Tá súil agam, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir McDowell, go gcuirfear leis an reachtaíocht seo agus go mbeimid in ann cur i láthair éifeachtach a fheiceáil i measc an chórais taobh amuigh de na Tithe seo. I echo the words of congratulations for Senator Ó Céidigh. It is not an easy process to bring legislation so effectively and unanimously through the House but, as Senator Marshall rightly stated, Senator Ó Céidigh has done so with great tenacity and in a great spirit of collaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> The core premise of the legislation is to consolidate and simplify the law. It aims to enable more effective punishment of those who commit the crime of perjury. I agree with Senator McDowell - worryingly, that is a common occurrence for me in this House - when he states that it is one thing to enact legislation such as this, but another entirely for it to be effectively implemented and enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">For all of the reasons that have been highlighted by colleagues, that is what we need to see happen beyond the realms of this place. Molaim an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh. Go n-éirí leis an reachtaíocht seo.</p>

I wholeheartedly congratulate my colleague, Senator Ó Céidigh, for, as someone said, his tenacity, persistence and focus. I acknowledge the role of the Minister and his Department with regard to this legislation. With regard to new politics, this proves that when people collaborate and sometimes compromise with each other, we can achieve good things. This is a good Bill. Not many Independent politicians get a Bill through these Houses. Well done to all involved who participated and engaged in this process because that is the important thing about politics, lawmakers and making legislation. Well done in particular to Senator Ó Céidigh, who took the initiative, ran with it and stuck with it. He made it an issue that he was personally involved with. That is his style. He champions things and he gets them over the line. I thank the Minister for his support and co-operation.</p>

I know that this issue of fraudulent claims, etc., goes back a long way in Galway. The Galway business community will be extremely proud of their local son who has brought this Bill forward. I congratulate the Senator. It says much to his character, his ability to bring people onside and to get them behind an idea. It has shone through in this Bill, which he must be proud of. Those who engage with him and the business people of Galway will be proud of what he has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I will turn to the Minister. Not every Minister is open to a new Bill being introduced by an Independent Member. I congratulate the Minister and his staff for their willingness to listen to the arguments from Senator Ó Céidigh, to offer advice and assistance, and to the Minister for sitting here calmly and working his way through the Bill with the group. I appreciate what the Minister has done. I know that when this gets to the Dáil, he will be equally agreeable in trying to move this forward, because I think he too is committed to it. I am delighted that the Independent Group in the Seanad provided sufficient training for Councillor Geoghegan to make it to the position of councillor for Fine Gael. If Fine Gael has anybody else who needs training, feel free to send them our way.</p>

He referred last week to the review that is being conducted. He may be aware that we had some lively discussion in this House earlier today on issues relating to the Defence Forces. We have asked that the Taoiseach come to the Seanad to address our wider concerns in this regard. The aspects of this legislation relating to the Garda Síochána are welcome, but we must look now to extending the same courtesy to members of the Defence Forces. To reiterate, these provisions do not give gardaí the right to strike but, rather, to have recourse to the industrial relations apparatus of the State to resolve issues. I hope the Minister of State will agree to address our concerns in legislation before too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">I take this opportunity to convey to the Leas-Chathaoirleach my deepest sympathy on the loss of his mother last week. Losing a mother, no matter what age one is, is never easy. I wish to put that on the record of the House in which the Leas-Chathaoirleach has such an important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I reassure Senator Mac Lochlainn that it is not the case that no progress is being made in respect of the Defence Forces on the issue of industrial relations mechanisms. Members of the forces have recourse in law to a parallel complaint and adjudication mechanism to compensate for the limitations on their access to the industrial relations machinery that is available to wider society. Members of the Defence Forces are unlike workers in other sectors in that they have an important and particular role to play. They do, however, have recourse to the Defence Forces Ombudsman, Defence Forces representative associations and the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> As the Senator acknowledged, I referred on Second Stage to the independent review that was completed last year. It recommended that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, to explore the practicalities of a Permanent Defence Force Representative Association forming associations and affiliations with ICTU while also giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service. Dialogue has commenced between the Department of Defence and ICTU in this regard. There are a lot of issues to be debated internally before further progress is possible, but it is an important step in that direction. We should allow the engagement to continue and see what comes out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for their engagement with the Bill, which completes a series of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1990. It will enable members of An Garda Síochána to access the independent industrial relations machinery of the State, namely, the Workplace Relations Commissions and the Labour Court, to bargain collectively with the Garda Commissioner on matters relating to work conditions. As such, it plays a small part in delivering aspects of the Government's ambitious Garda reform programme. I acknowledge the invaluable work of the interdepartmental working group, chaired by Mr. John Murphy, which examined the industrial relations structures within the Garda Síochána and made recommendations on the policy underlying this Bill. It is a complex area and there was a lot of work to be done, which the working group undertook in a collaborative fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> I also acknowledge the invaluable co-operation of the Garda associations. I appreciate that the Bill does not deliver all their ambitions but I believe they share my view, which I have stated previously in the House, that gardaí are not simply "workers" in the everyday sense of that word. We recognise that the police service is exceptional. We also recognise the unique powers gardaí have as guardians of the peace and our security and the importance of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> The Bill strikes the right balance between ensuring the public need for the essential services provided by the Garda Síochána is met and the right for employees to negotiate for appropriate employment standards. I hope it can be sent to the President as soon as possible to be signed. Senators have done good work on the legislation and I appreciate the time the various spokespersons have put into it. I thank them for their full co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality back to the Seanad for this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The purpose of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) (Amendment) Bill 2019 is to achieve one simple goal, namely, ensuring that sufficient measures are in place to protect our nurses, gardaí, firefighters, accident and emergency personnel, ambulance personnel and Army personnel who, on a daily basis, put their lives at risk in doing their work. We live in a civilised country confident in the knowledge that in times of emergency there are services we can call on to help, whether it is the fire brigade, the ambulance or the Garda. However, emergency workers often find themselves in dangerous circumstances. They risk their lives as they work to help and save others. It is disappointing and even distressing that those we call on for help can themselves be put at risk through assault. Those working long hard hours in the emergency services repeatedly put themselves into dangerous situations for the sake of our safety and care. As a result, the onus is on us, as legislators, to protect our nurses, paramedics, gardaí, firefighters and others in front-line emergency services. The least we can do is ensure sufficient protections are in place to protect the people who may be assaulted in the course of their duties. We can do this through enhancing the laws already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The facts are alarming. On a weekly basis, members of our emergency services are being targeted when performing their duties. Nurses have accounted for almost 70% of the total number of assaults on hospital staff in the past ten years according to figures released by the HSE. Between 2008 and the end of November 2018, some 10,744 staff reported assaults ranging from actual harm to near-misses and complaints. More than 7,500 of these assaults targeted nurses. In fact, by December 2018, a total of 948 incidents were reported. In 61% of cases, nurses were the victims. Doctors reported 25 assaults while other grades, including catering and housekeeping staff, reported a further 339 incidents. There have been 1,267 assaults on members of An Garda Síochána since 2012. In 2016, this figure was 259, representing an increase of almost 50% over a four-year period. Over 5,500 gardaí have now been injured in the line of duty since 2005. There were 102 cases of assault reported by firefighters and paramedics at Dublin Fire Brigade between 2013 and the end of 2017 according to figures released by Dublin City Council in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There were 47 instances of violent harassment and aggression towards paramedics in 2016 alone, while 2017 saw 53 recorded incidents, 44 physical and nine verbal. In 2018, there were 32 recorded incidents, 23 physical and nine verbal. The Bill will see the introduction of a specific mandatory prison sentence of 12 months on summary conviction in respect of an assault on a member of the emergency services. It provides that on indictment, the mandatory prison sentence is increased to two years and may extend to a period of seven years' imprisonment at the court's discretion. The Bill will also provide for the offence of ramming of an emergency vehicle, with a mandatory prison sentence of 12 months on summary conviction, which increases to two years on indictment and is extendable to ten years at the court's discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> We in Ireland are not alone in our concerns for the safety of emergency and front-line workers. In September 2018, the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill was signed into law in Westminster, creating a new offence of assault against an emergency worker in the exercise of their functions with a penalty that was increased from six to 12 months. In Victoria, Australia, the Justice Legislation Miscellaneous Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced in Parliament in June 2018, making the injuring of an emergency worker a category 1 offence and bringing it to the same level as murder and rape. In New Zealand, a Bill proposing a mandatory minimum sentence for people who assault emergency staff is being considered in Parliament at the moment. We have an opportunity today to offer protection to those who protect us. I look forward to hearing other Members' comments and hope we get agreement such that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible.</p>

On a weekly basis, members of our emergency services are being targeted in their roles. Nurses have been to the fore when it comes to assaults on medical staff, accounting for almost 70% of total assaults on hospital staff over the past ten years. These are all HSE figures. In An Garda Síochána, there have been 1,267 assaults on members since 2012. In 2016, this figure was 259, an increase of almost 50% over four years. It is frightening that more than 5,500 gardaí have been injured in the line of duty since 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> The Bill introduces measures that will provide safety to members in the front-line emergency services. They include mandatory prison sentences and extending the two-year sentence to seven at the decision of the court. There is widespread agreement on how difficult the job is on the front line. The Bill should be supported to ensure we provide a safe working environment for our gardaí, nurses, paramedics, fire-fighters and other front-line emergency services. It is a crucial Bill and I am delighted to second it.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I compliment Senator Gallagher on bringing this forward. Some of the statistics he has given are very revealing. Considering the way society has developed in terms of respect for human life in general but particularly for those who are trying to protect the public, I think they need enhanced protections at the moment. I have in mind a particular case a number of years ago. Garda Robert McCallion was serving in the force in Donegal. He was rammed by somebody who was subsequently caught and charged. I know the family very well and they had another member in the force, Garda John McCallion, who was a community liaison officer and who died recently as well from natural causes. In the case of Garda Robert McCallion, what was heartbreaking for the family in the subsequent court case was that the jury deciding on the sentence was instructed by the judge not to take into account the fact that the victim was in a Garda uniform; they were to regard him as a member of the public rather than a member of the Garda. I do not want to make any comment on the judgment. All I am saying is that there is need for further protections for our emergency services in this society in 2019. Our party will be very supportive of this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I welcome the Minister and the Bill we are debating. I understand entirely the intention behind it and commend Senator Gallagher and his colleagues. The spirit of the Bill is clear and worthwhile, particularly given the many instances in which emergency service workers have found themselves on the front line, vulnerable, dealing with situations that put them in the way of unnecessary harm, threat and danger. By their very nature, emergency service workers are all too willing to step into the bearna baoil and put themselves front and centre for the protection and welfare of their fellow citizens. We must acknowledge and commend that reality in tonight's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I have some political issues in that I believe when emergency services find themselves in these vulnerable positions, more often than not it is because we have not adequately addressed or invested in the issues for which support is needed. We know of many cases in which people in the healthcare sector have to deal with those who are vulnerable and have mental health and addiction issues. This is in no way to take away from the core premise of the Bill. Many times, they should not have to find themselves in those threatening or precarious situations, but they do. I would contest at this early stage in the debate that we have not invested to deal in the right way with a lot of the societal realities that exist and that present very real threats to our emergency service professionals. That said, of course there are other instances in which members of An Garda Síochána or people who work in our hospitals have found themselves under threat from thugs, people who are just out to wreck and ruin. They should face the full rigours of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> I am of a view that in accepting the amendments to the Judicial Council Bill, we as legislators have delivered on the concept of sentencing guidelines similar to those of other jurisdictions, something that has long been sought by groups representing victims of crime in all of its many forms. It is my opinion that this was a landmark moment for the Irish justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I expect ultimately that the vast majority of criminal justice cases in the State will see a judge having to take into account sentencing guidelines for the offence in the future, making it a very significant move. Far too often, we have seen victims feeling severely wronged as the perpetrators of crime have been faced with inadequate and inappropriate sentencing. Everybody agrees that the severity of a sentence must match that of the crime. There are currently too many instances where this is not happening. While the vast majority of judges balance the considerations well, the sentencing guidelines will tackle the issue of unsuitable sentences being handed down. The public deserve to know that offenders will receive a sentence that fits the crime and that heinous crimes will be met by stiff sentences. They deserve to know that there is a basis for calculating a sentence. </p>
          <p eId="para_343"> We have indicated in the past in other debates, as the Minister will know, that we are opposed to mandatory sentencing on that basis. We believe judges should have the flexibility to deal with crimes as they present themselves. I said to my colleagues in Fianna Fáil who have moved this Bill tonight, that that is not to dilute or take away from what they are trying to do here. It is to enable, empower and allow our judges to be free and able to deliver the type of sentencing that is warranted to perpetrators of crime such as those referenced in tonight's debate, in each individual case. We will not be opposing this Bill and may engage with colleagues as to how we can refine it at later Stages, to take some of our concerns into consideration as we move forward. I do not doubt for one moment the intention behind Senator Gallagher's moving of this Bill. We want to ensure that it is as good as it can be and we will work with colleagues and with the Minister and his officials to that end.</p>

          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_344">I thank my colleague, Senator O'Mahony, for stepping in for me, as I was engaged with my nominating body. I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend Senator Gallagher on what is a very important piece of legislation. I am delighted that the Government is not opposing it, in a similar manner in which we did not oppose and worked with Senator Ó Céidigh when he brought his perjury Bill to the House, which I was delighted to see pass through this House unopposed. The Government worked constructively with Senator Ó Céidigh to ensure that the Bill was improved. The apparatus of the Minister's office, his officials, the Attorney General and all other stakeholders worked to see that this Bill was something that this House as a whole and collective body could be very proud of. We can see any reason why the same "meithealship" cannot prevail with Senator Gallagher's Bill as we all fully agree with its principle and motivation. We have all seen the people at the front line of our emergency services throughout this country putting their lives on the line to help people in search and rescue as well as search and recovery missions who deal with intricate, difficult and challenging terrain that can be extremely volatile as to people's health and safety, and lives. Where thugs exacerbate and compound these challenges by deliberately going out to harm these people and make their front-line job more difficult is totally reprehensible. Every citizen in this country with any kind of moral fibre within their conscience would have an issue with that. As legislators we are all on the one hymn sheet when it comes to this issue. There is precedent for what Senator Gallagher is trying to achieve. If a garda is murdered in the line of duty, for example, this is a capital offence, and my understanding is that a life sentence is the immediate consequence of that and there are no mitigating circumstances where that can be evaporated in anyway. The principle that the Senator wishes to achieve here is already recognised by the State. We should look to further expanding what the Senator is trying to achieve with this Bill in that people who provide essential services such as those driving buses, trains, on the Luas and taxi drivers, who ensure that people get home safely at night, could all be considered as part of what the Senator is seeking to do here. They are providing front-line essential services to assist the general public in going about their lives on a daily basis in a safe, secure and comfortable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> As an Oireachtas, we need to embrace the principle of what we are trying to achieve in this Bill. I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is of the same mind. We all want to see a safe, secure, unintimidating environment. Putting the law in place is one thing. Another, however, to is ensure that the resources are channelled to make the law effective. That is where the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has really shone. We have seen the Garda numbers coming from Templemore in recent times and what Commissioner Harris has achieved by putting people onto the front line as we deal with very difficult situations. </p>
          <p eId="para_346"> We saw the petrol bombing of a home in Drogheda again last night. This is reprehensible behaviour. An Garda Síochána and this Government will in no way shirk in their response to this situation. We will take these people on, will defeat them, ensure that they are brought to justice, and we will ensure that the people of Drogheda will be able to walk around their town day and night in a safe and secure environment. This will be achieved, not just in Drogheda but in every street, town, city and village in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I am looking forward at 6 p.m. this evening to a very fruitful and informative engagement with Commissioner Harris who will be attending the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to give us an update on the work he is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> We all have a responsibility in this House to work together. We have demonstrated this in many cases over the last three years and as I already referenced in Senator Ó Céidigh's Bill today. I would like to see that type of co-operation extended to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, where the Minister and I and other Members have spent nearly 150 hours non-stop in this Chamber dealing with all sorts of scenarios, primarily of a filibustering nature, where walk-through votes are called, with two to one majorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_349"> We are here to talk about Senator Gallagher's Bill and it is one of the better Bills that I have seen come through this House and I commend him for it. We on this side of the House will do anything we can to enhance it and bring it to fruition, where someday, hopefully in the not too distant future, President Higgins will sign it and it will become the law of the land.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_350">I thank the Cathaoirleach and all of the Senators who made a contribution, and in particular, the sponsor Senator Gallagher.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> It is clear that the subject matter of the Bill is one to which we can all relate. We are very conscious of the important work done by people operating in front-line duties and the difficulties and challenges which they face on a daily and nightly basis. It is, of course, imperative that members of the emergency services, be they the Garda Síochána, prison officers, the fire brigade, ambulance personnel, the Defence Forces and persons providing medical services are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves, oftentimes situations of challenge, and more often than not situations of emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I know that there is great deal of concern about the need to protect members of our emergency services and medical personnel when serious incidents occur, and there is great sympathy, particularly where such incidents result in injury to such persons or to innocent members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The spirit and intention behind the Senators' Bill is clear, namely, to protect members of our emergency services and persons providing medical services in difficult front-line and emergency situations. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> As the law stands, a specific offence in regard to assault of a peace officer or person providing medical services is covered in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. General assault offences are provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and criminal damage offences are provided for in the Criminal Damage Act 1991. The offences contained in these statutes would address both the offence of assaulting a peace officer or a person providing medical services causing harm or serious harm and the offence of ramming an emergency services vehicles as would, in the relevant circumstances, homicide offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> In that regard, I remind Senators of the following provisions which are of particular relevance. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for explicit statutory offences where peace officers or persons providing medical services are assaulted or obstructed in the execution of their duty. Section 19(1) of that Act provides that any person who assaults a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty or a person providing medical services at a hospital is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. This maximum penalty was increased from a five-year term to a seven-year term by the Criminal Justice Act 2006. A peace officer is defined in the Act as meaning a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer, a member of the fire brigade, ambulance personnel or a member of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties. Let us not forget that the assault and related provisions in that Act apply to assaults on all sectors of our community, which also includes peace officers and persons providing medical services. That Act provides for penalties of up to five years for an offence of assault causing harm and a penalty of up to life imprisonment for an offence of assault causing serious harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The Road Traffic Acts provide for a range of offences. Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides for an offence of dangerous driving with penalties of up to ten years or €20,000 where death or serious bodily harm result.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The Office of the Attorney General has examined the Bill and advised that the proposed offences contained in it require clarification in that the conduct described as "ramming" another vehicle would appear to be already covered under existing road traffic legislation and that the provision in regard to assaults on members of the emergency services appears to be already covered by the existing section 19(1) but using the terminology of the assault offences contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. In addition, section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for an offence where a person intends to damage property or is reckless as to whether any property is damaged and intends by such damage to endanger the life of another or is reckless as to whether the life of another would be endangered. This offence, which is particularly relevant in the context of an activity such as ramming an emergency vehicle, carries a penalty of imprisonment for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I believe Senators will agree there is already a considerable wealth of legislation in place to enable the prosecution of those who would assault causing harm or serious harm to or damage with intent to endanger the life of any citizen. That said, I know the Senators' Bill arises from concern for the safety of front-line personnel and first responders.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> As the Senators have outlined, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the introduction of mandatory minimum prison sentences in respect of assault of a peace officer and of a new offence of ramming an emergency services vehicle. Section 2 provides for the introduction of the offence of ramming an emergency services vehicle. It provides for a mandatory minimum penalty of 12 months on summary conviction and two years on conviction on indictment. Section 3 provides for the introduction of a mandatory prison sentence of 12 months on summary conviction and two years on conviction on indictment for assault causing harm or causing serious harm to a peace officer or to a person providing medical services.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> I turn to the issue of mandatory minimum sentencing. As Senators are aware, the traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to the maximum applying and also making sure of the application at all times of the principle of proportionality. There are some exceptions to this such as a mandatory sentence for murder and presumptive minimum sentences for certain drug trafficking and firearms offences. In the latter case, the relevant legislative provisions set down a minimum sentence to be imposed unless the court is satisfied there are exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence or to the person convicted of the offence which would make such a sentence unjust in all the circumstances. Such sentences were specifically introduced because of the impact those types of offences have on society in general and communities in particular. In that regard and in the context of this Bill, I should mention the mandatory minimum provisions provided for in this Bill do not contain those important components. There is no provision for the court, when considering whether the sentence would be unjust, to have regard to matters such as whether the public interest would be served by a lesser sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Office of the Attorney General has also examined the provisions of the Private Members' Bill and has advised that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of the Bill, particularly in respect of the summary offences, are "constitutionally frail". The sentencing provisions in the Bill are described as "minimum terms of imprisonment". In the case of summary conviction, the "minimum term" is 12 months. However, 12 months' imprisonment is, in fact, the maximum penalty that can be imposed on a single offence in the District Court. This provision is, therefore, problematic in that there is no discretion left to the sentencing judge to apply the sentencing principles as part of the trial process which must be conducted according to due course of law as required by Article 38.1 of the Constitution, with the specific circumstances of each case taken into account by the court before a sentence is handed down and decided upon. Perhaps consideration could be given to the introduction of a presumptive minimum sentence rather than a mandatory minimum sentence which would allow for judicial discretion to sentence proportionately in individual specific cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I draw the attention of Senators to the fact that the penalties provided for in the Bill are less than those provided for in both the Criminal Damage Act and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act. Prosecution under either Act can attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in respect of a serious breach.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I thank the Senators who proposed the Bill and those who participated in the debate. It is clear that much work has gone into its preparation. I value that work and the interest shown in criminal justice matters. We are all immensely grateful to members of the emergency services and our medical personnel for their outstanding dedication and commitment and for the important and all too frequently dangerous work they do day and night to protect us and the public interest. As I have outlined, there is already a comprehensive body of legislation in place to enable prosecution of the type of assault or damage provided for in the Bill. However, I want to support the policy objective of the Senators' Bill and I will, therefore, not oppose the proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">It will be important to engage in further discussion on how best to give effect to the principles underlying the Bill and in this regard I was particularly struck by the contribution of Senator Ó Donnghaile. There are issues we need to consider before deciding that this is the final article. I refer in particular to issues regarding the sentencing provisions which, in my view, require amendment before they could be placed on the Statute Book. I will seek to work with the Senators who proposed the Bill and other Members of the Seanad in that regard. I should also add that, as the Bill creates a criminal offence, the issue of a money message will need to be addressed in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I thank Senators for introducing a debate on this important topic.

          <p eId="para_370"> Getting back to the business at hand, I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor, who seconded the Bill, for her support. I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate for the support they have shown in respect of the legislation. I acknowledge the Minister's comments, which were quite comprehensive. Senator Murnane O'Connor put her finger on it when she stated that it is sad and depressing that we have to discuss this legislation at all. It is sad that people do not have more respect for those who protect us.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> When drafting the Bill, I gathered statistics from various emergency worker sources. I compliment all those to whom I have spoken for the information they provided. Unfortunately, they are all of the one mind in that they feel the statistics provided would make a strong case in support of more firm sentencing for people who assault emergency workers. I fully appreciate that the Bill is not the final draft in any shape or form, but it is a genuine attempt to address the concerns of those emergency workers who we, as a society, are fortunate to have and who put their lives at risk on occasion. Unfortunately, as Senator O'Mahony outlined, this sometimes has devastating consequences in that they lose their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> There is an onus on us to put in place firm protections and send out a strong message to the effect that we will not tolerate anyone who assaults an emergency worker in the course of his or her duty and that there will be major repercussions for those who cross the line in this regard. That is a key message in behind the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I look forward to working with all my colleagues and the Minister and his staff to make this Bill as secure as we possibly can in the ambition we all have to put in place firm protections for those who protect us.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the summer economic statement, SES. The SES constitutes a key part of our improved budgetary process and provides the basis for fiscal policy formulation in advance of budget 2020. It outlines, in broad terms, the parameters that will frame discussions due to take place at this year's national economic dialogue over the next number of days about options and priorities in advance of October’s budget. It builds on the stability programme update, SPU, published in April and it sets out the Government’s medium-term economic and fiscal strategy as well as the constraints facing the economy over the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> On the short-term outlook, the SPU projects growth of 3.9% of GDP this year as well as a budgetary surplus of 0.2%. Our public finances have been firmly placed on a path to sustainable recovery, with this Government prioritising budgetary policies that are focused on economic stability and growth. Recovery is evident across a range of economic indicators, with the labour market in particular now close to full employment. Notwithstanding the progress to date, there remain a number of significant risks to the outlook which I will touch upon shortly. This is why the Government has been continuing to rebuild our fiscal buffers, to ensure we have capacity to deal with any adverse economic shock that could emerge. This fiscal strategy includes targeting budget surpluses, reducing our public debt and establishing the rainy day fund. In addition, the decision to more than double our level of capital investment from €4.2 billion to €8.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, will mean that the necessary conditions are in place to help boost the growth potential of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> While we have made significant progress in terms of ensuring our recovery, we must be cognisant of the risks to the economic outlook. Since publication of the SPU, risks to our economy have intensified. Domestically, we are facing the possibility of overheating as well as the fiscal vulnerability that stems from the volatility of our corporation tax revenue. On the international front, there is an increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit as well as the risks associated with possible changes to the international trade policy environment. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, it is crucial that budgetary policy is centred on building fiscal capacity and supporting economic stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> On the risks associated with Brexit in particular, this year's SES has been prepared on the basis of two budgetary scenarios, with the first scenario assuming an orderly Brexit and the second assuming a disorderly Brexit. In the event of an orderly Brexit, the appropriate budgetary policy will be to stay within the parameters as set out in the SPU. Any expenditure increases or taxation reductions outside of these parameters would risk further inflating the economy. The SPU projects a surplus of 0.4% of GDP next year. Targeting this surplus will mean increased capacity to absorb the impact of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The budget 2020 framework involves a budgetary package of €2.8 billion for 2020. Under the orderly Brexit scenario, with current and capital expenditure commitments amounting to €2.1 billion, which include pre-commitments of €1.9 billion and a capital reserve of up to €0.2 billion being established to accommodate funding requirements for the national broadband plan and the national children’s hospital, this leaves €0.7 billion to be specifically allocated as part of budget 2020. Under the disorderly Brexit scenario, this could involve a headline deficit in the region of -0.5% to -1.5% of GDP for next year, a swing of up to €6 billion. Come September, if a disorderly Brexit is the most likely scenario then a no policy change approach will need to be adopted for budget 2020 in order to ensure the State has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, while preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. This will also ensure that sustainable improvements in living standards can be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> As set out already, the risks to the public finances arising from the high concentration of corporation tax receipts and from increasing public expenditure on the basis of transitory receipts have been well documented. The Minister for Finance has requested his officials to prepare a paper to examine policy options aimed at ensuring that the concentration of corporation tax receipts and the fiscal rules do not lead to budgetary imbalances. The Minister will publish this paper shortly and will give consideration to some of the policy options in advance of drawing up recommendations for Government in the autumn. Running budgetary surpluses and establishing the rainy day fund are examples of policy measures that are being adopted by this Government to mitigate the vulnerabilities in our public finances. Furthermore, the broadening of the tax base over the last decade has ensured revenue streams into the Exchequer have stabilised to allow for the funding of essential public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> As we enter this period of increasing economic uncertainty, our priority is to pursue sound, budgetary policies. This means continuing to invest in our public services and, as a small and highly globalised economy, ensuring that we maintain balanced books and continue to reduce debt in order to build resilience against Brexit and any further shocks to our economy.</p>

        <speech by="#GerryHorkan" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_399">I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement. Much of the heat surrounding the summer economic statement arose in discussions when it was published yesterday. I read some of the contributions made in the Dáil yesterday evening, in particular those of spokespersons and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Brexit is the most obvious issue that arises. If Brexit goes well, we might be all right but if it does not and there is a no-deal or hard Brexit, the potential swing in the public finances will be from a €1 billion surplus to a €5 billion deficit. As the Minister of State noted, this is a movement of about €6 billion. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has noted that between €3 billion and €6 billion of the €10.5 billion of corporation tax receipts is relatively unstable and not guaranteed in any sense. There are, therefore, uncertain and potentially choppy waters ahead. That is not to take away from the positives. We have almost full employment and we ran a surplus last year for the first time. Fianna Fáil is involved in the confidence and supply agreement and has played its part in facilitating the minority Government. We are doing our bit to make sure everything goes as well as it can. The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018 was passed last week with the unanimous support of the House. The rainy day fund is a positive measure which featured in my party's manifesto in 2015. It was also part of the confidence and supply agreement and I am pleased that, as part of its agreement with Fianna Fáil, the Government has secured the rainy day fund. That the fund will have €2 billion in it by the end of this year is a positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> We also have challenges in how we manage capital projects and expenditure. We are seeing constant overruns in health year on year. Last year, the overrun was approximately €650 million and we also have overruns in the national children's hospital and national broadband plan. Only €200 million of the €2.8 billion available in the fiscal space will go towards addressing those overruns. We are, therefore, kicking some of the problem down the road. We need to find significant resources to fund projects such as the children's hospital and the national broadband plan in the long term. The Minister says there is €2.8 billion of fiscal space, of which he has committed €2.1 billion. Some people have pointed out that the latter figure does not include the Christmas bonus, which would eat up €300 million of the fiscal space. Others argue that the €2.1 billion figure includes the Christmas bonus. I ask the Minister of State to indicate whether the bonus is included in the figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> We need to remain cognisant that corporation tax receipts account for much of our revenue. I welcome our revenue from corporation tax and would be delighted if it was €20 billion or €30 billion. The way to avoid overdependence on corporation tax receipts is to have an increasing number of companies paying the tax because that would reduce our dependence on particular companies. The Minister has announced a review of corporation tax, which some people would prefer to have done externally. I understand the Minister's rationale for doing it internally and possibly having it independently validated.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has pointed out significant issues with the national finances. It noted the pitfalls of Brexit, the €645 million overrun in the Department of Health last year and that Government spending in 2018 breached the expenditure benchmark laid down in domestic and EU fiscal rules. The Government claims that no project will be impacted by the overruns in the national broadband plan and the children's hospital but projects will clearly be postponed and delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> It is very much the case that we do not know what will happen. The summer economic statement outlines the history and points out how well we are doing, relatively speaking. While that is valid, in addition to the €2.8 billion of fiscal space, we may need to borrow up to €6 billion if Brexit goes badly. With every passing day, the likelihood of a no-deal rather than an orderly Brexit increases. The fiscal space is small in the context of having to borrow if Brexit goes wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> It is important that we have stability and that is why our party will support a budget, subject to the parameters outlined between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the confidence and supply agreement. That agreement has delivered many measures, including 1,600 new gardaí, an increase in the old age pension and a boost to third level funding. I will not list them all because they are well documented. I wish the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government the best as they deal with Brexit in the uncertain times ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Corporation tax receipts, while very welcome, are very unstable. We keep finding extra money which allows the Minister to avoid borrowing or cutting services to fund overruns. At some point, the curve will go the other way because we will not keep finding additional corporation tax revenue, much as I would like that. Equally, interest rates are at a historical low and the national debt is costing us less to service than it ever did. If interest rates change at any point, the Minister may not be as lucky or fortunate as he has been thus far.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Members of both Houses need to be cognisant of the figures and committed to examining them. I did not like the note on the Government's website that the summer economic statement gives the Dáil an opportunity to examine the figures. No reference was made to the Seanad. The website could have at least referred to the Oireachtas. It is true that the Dáil passes the budget but the Seanad is also discussing the summer economic statement. The finance spokespersons are present and a number of Senators are on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. There is a role for this House in debating the statement, as we are doing now. Maybe the language of the Department will reflect that in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> Fianna Fáil is facilitating the Fine Gael-led minority Government, subject to the confidence and supply agreement. We have secured various measures within that but I am concerned about corporation tax and capital and revenue overruns. I wish the Minister of State and the Government well in tackling those issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">I am sharing time with Senator Boyhan. The summer economic statement is, as Senator Horkan said, challenging in some respects and reassuring in others. As the statement notes, the economy is in a remarkably better condition than it was a number of years ago after the financial crash. There are, however, some fundamental underlying problems, such as the indebtedness per head of the Irish population, which is at a high level internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> While the Minister of State spoke about the economy being effectively close to full employment, there are ambitious infrastructural plans outlined to the Irish people for the next 20 to 30 years, including some which are needed in the short run rather than the long run. For instance, if one looks at the plans and figures for social and affordable housing, although public housing is a better phrase to describe it, the suggestion is that 20,000 extra construction workers would be required for that and we do not have them as far as I can see. Likewise, people are talking about a massive programme of rehabilitation of our existing housing stock. An extra 20,000 people would be required for that according to some of its proponents. I do not see where those 40,000 people will come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> We face real constraints. If we are to hit our environmental targets, we have to address issues such as public transport, for example, an increased use of rail, and a reconfiguration of our cities. I put on record again my strong belief that our urban development patterns must radically change and that we must be willing to build higher and more centralised cities. We cannot have people commuting for two or three hours, even if they are commuting in electric cars, in ten or 15 years' time. We still cannot afford to have that waste in our environmental spatial strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Another matter I emphasise is that it behoves all politicians, from all sides of the ideological and party spectrums, to respect the fact that we must contain public spending within reasonable limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">We cannot let the controls slip from us, especially now, as we approach the end of the confidence and supply agreement, to which Senator Horkan referred, and possibly the end of an electoral cycle. It is vitally important that a spending spree is not promised in the same abandoned way as in the UK, for example, where Boris Johnson is making extravagant promises on taxation, and repatriating £39 billion, to the British electorate. We must have a responsible electoral cycle, and everything has to be constantly subject to reality checks and the constraints on our economy. I fully agree with the Government's position that the possibility of a disorderly Brexit requires a huge conditionality to be attached to our budgetary strategy over the next couple of months. Like everybody else, I hope the UK will have a negotiated, orderly exit from the European Union, if it insists on leaving. We have to be very clear that a disorderly, unilateral, no-deal exit would have profound effects on our budgetary situation, and I commend the Minister and the Government on their determination to make provisional arrangements in their budgetary planning to deal with that scenario, should it emerge. As somebody said many years ago, "A lot done, a lot more to do", and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and thank him for coming to the House to discuss the summer economic statement. As Senator McDowell said, and the Minister of State acknowledged, all budgetary policy must be framed against the background of the rising possibility of a disorderly Brexit in the autumn. That was clearly echoed in both the Minister of State's speech and his report, and I commend him on the way in which the report has been laid out by his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to a short paragraph on page 36 of this report, which must be welcomed. It refers to the issue of budget transparency, and claims that access to timely, objective, and accurate information is a precondition for citizens to understand how public resources are being managed, participate in informed debate, and hold the Government properly to account. That is right, and I welcome that. I also acknowledge the reform of budgetary policy and framework. We must achieve openness, transparency, and, ultimately, public accountability in our public resources and finances. That is a good thing which we should welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Finally, I note a commitment here which I wish to acknowledge. At the time of the budget, we will dedicate a citizens' guide to the budget which will be published to explain the key decisions in clear and non-technical language, which is a positive move. This guide will be an objective, self-contained document that focuses on the objectives and content of the budget, presented in a concise and accessible format. It is intended to foster greater understanding of public finances, public finance policy and choices, and ensure members of the public fully understand the budgetary decisions that will impact on their lives. That is important and I wanted to single it out because sometimes, with all the economic and financial jargon of the budget, the punters on the street do not quite understand what is going on. That is a clever move. I welcome it and ask the Minister of State to pass that message on to the Minister and the Department. It is important that, on the day of the budget, we have a concise, simple infographic and some key messages about funds, because this is the public's money. That initiative is welcome. I again thank the Minister of State for his report and for coming to the House today.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">I hardly think so.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I welcome the summer economic statement. Taking an overall view, I approve of the approach taken with this particular summer economic statement in that it deals with Brexit, which is hanging over us. There is no point in saying otherwise. Brexit is a certainty, and there is now a strong possibility of a hard Brexit. We have to be prudent, and we have to be true to our policies as a Government as well. The economy is now back on a reasonably sound footing, we have a budget surplus for the first time in ten years, we have virtually full employment, with over 2.3 million people working, and our unemployment rate is below what would normally be termed full employment. However, our debt levels are still high, and we have to be cautious about that, in both the public and private sectors. Our debt levels are coming down, and while we have certainly seen a reduction in both public and private debt levels, particularly this year, it is something we must be conscious of.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Public investment in infrastructure projects stopped from 2007 onwards, and one would have to question whether that was the correct approach, in hindsight. It is important that we continue to invest in public infrastructure. Design and planning of the M20 motorway is under way, and a 60-bed block is being built in University Hospital Limerick, which is hugely important. Flood relief projects are happening up and down the country. Senator McDowell referred to public transport, and I would be hugely supportive of both our rail network and other networks. That feeds into the whole issue of climate change and our carbon footprint, which is something we have to look at. We also have to be conscious that our indigenous exports sector is hugely dependent on the UK, so if there is a hard Brexit, there will definitely be implications for us in Ireland, and we have to prepare for it in that way. Equally, a soft Brexit would make it much easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> This summer economic statement effectively presents a picture of a balanced budget, full employment, a doubling of capital investment, and having a proper programme back on board, but it also presents the risks, which relate to Brexit and the level of increase we have seen in corporation tax. There is a body of work within the Department and we have to look at that in terms of long-term structure. We are also looking at the climate plan, with carbon taxes rising up to 2030, and insurance as well. I am conscious of striking a balance, and I have a fundamental view on that. I do not believe someone on €680 a week should be paying a marginal tax rate of 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I do not believe so. Equally, we have to look after people who are less well off, including social welfare and carer's recipients. This is the balance to be struck by Government. We also have to put money aside. Senator Horkan mentioned the rainy day fund, which we debated recently in the Seanad. There was almost unanimous support here, explicit or implicit, for the overall objective of the rainy day fund. There will be €2 billion in a rainy day fund by the end of this year, which is a significant amount of money. We are moving into the territory of counter-cyclical budgets. If the economy is showing signs of overheating, we must put money aside for a rainy day. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> If there is a hard Brexit, the Government will have to support people exporting to the UK, including in terms of jobs and a multitude of other areas. A hard Brexit will bring various problems. A disorderly Brexit would involve a headline deficit of between 0.5% and 2.5% and a swing of up to €6 billion, which could have significant implications for us. However, all that is outside of our control. The British Parliament will decide on the type of Brexit it wants, which is conditional on a number of factors, including who will be the new leader of the Tory Party and Prime Minister. However, it is important to remain positive. The majority of MPs are not in favour of a no-deal Brexit. We have to hope that this will bring realism and common sense to the Brexit issue. Ireland and the UK are inextricably linked. </p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I welcome the summer economic statement. I agree with Senator McDowell that we must maintain control over spending. Equally, we must ensure we give breaks to hard pressed families across a range of areas. It is a balancing act. The outcome of the Brexit process in the UK, our nearest neighbour, will have huge implications for us. It is a terrible shame that the UK is leaving Europe. The UK was an ally for Ireland in various discussions and negotiations in Europe. I do not believe there will be a rethink. Rather, I think there will be a Brexit. The only question is what form it will take. This summer economic statement deals with the realities of what is unfolding in the UK in front of our eyes. We must be prepared. This document goes a significant towards that end.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">I mean in this circle. With so much to answer for over the two weeks, we could all be forgiven for assuming that would see something new and novel in yesterday's summer economic statement. This publication is a bit like Senator Kieran O'Donnell's speech in that it is another exercise in fantasy. The statement announces a budget package that lays out €7 million in additional spending over and above that which is already precommitted.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">All this is based on spending and the revenue projections that two leading economic institutions in as many weeks have branded as not credible. This Government's long-standing policy of over-reliance on tax receipts will continue and with it so too will the uncertainty around the funding of our public services. I am delighted the hospital in Limerick is getting a new extension. Meanwhile, hospital beds in Mayo are being closed and home help hours are being cut and refused. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> There are no changes to revenue projection. There is no indication that this Government's woeful record on tax will be improved. The Fine Gael fantasy tax cut is even mapped out, stripping €3 billion from the public purse. On top of this, a further €200 million is being used to mop up the fiscal mess and serious waste caused by this Government in regard to the broadband plan. Before I came to the Seanad I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, where the broadband plan was being discussed with the ESB. Yesterday, the committee discussed it with Eir. What a debacle. What a job the Government has made of that plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> As the spending projections remain completely unrealistic so too does the draft budget package. The sum of €700 million will be gobbled up instantly by the Christmas bonus and the latest overrun on health. Is the Government telling the people that there will be Brexit preparation measures this year or will it be pleading again for some corporation tax receipts to be found down the back of the sofa? In regard to the last crash, it was impossible to project tax receipts because, again, of our over-dependence on corporation tax. It is worrying to see this happening again. As there is no difference between Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, we can expect more of the same. </p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Put simply, there are no changes to tax projections, no changes to the fictional spending projections and no measures outlined on how to broaden the tax base. These plans are now workable. Meanwhile, the upcoming budget and, perhaps, much of the political energy of this State will be dominated by events across the water. Indeed, they will ultimately be decided by the whims of whatever Tory candidate inherits that party's leadership. The Government may not have known that weeks after the publication of the October budget we will be staring into a potential no-deal scenario but it knew Brexit was coming and that it could only spell trouble for the Irish economy, in particular for exporters in the agrifood sector in the Border and rural communities. Those producing for the North-South and Irish-British supply chains are particularly vulnerable. A no-deal Brexit is a very real possibility and, therefore, so too is a deep and significant downturn in the Irish economy. The only sensible response to this potential crisis is support and investment in this budget in a way that will increase our economic capacity. The summer economic statement fails to outline the path we will take as a State to provide that support or the tax measures that will be amended to fund it.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Sinn Féin has proposed a varied range of fiscal and tax measures to support the areas and industries that will be most affected by Brexit. Foremost among those was the creation of a €2 billion Brexit support fund to be used as and when it is needed, funded in part by money this Government intends to squirrel away to bail out the banks again. Beyond those on the coalface of the Brexit threat, our economy is crying out for investment. The Government presides over one of the lowest labour participations in the EU. We need more people at work and more people in proper, secure employment. This can be achieved by lowering the cost and burden of child care on families. For people who may find themselves pushed out of work by the Brexit downturn we need investment in active labour market schemes to provide support and retraining, if necessary. In that regard, we do not need schemes like JobPath on which €185 million that has been wasted. We need capital investment that will unlock the opportunities presented by the low carbon transitions. All this requires targeted investment that will secure longer-term growth and mitigate the worst impacts of the downturn. Investment requires fair and sustainable taxation. This is impossible if the Government remains committed to its farcical tax break election pledges. Despite all its warnings of prudence in the summer economic statement the Government has again mapped out how €3 billion taken from the tax base over five years in an election giveaway will only affect the top 20% of earners, including for 2020. This means €3 billion less in revenue as we stare into a downturn. As recently as the last couple of weeks, two major economic institutions have issued warnings about the Government's management of the State finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">If we have not yet seen any detail, the question is when we will. If there is none, will we ever see it? Is the Government simply using the public finances for election posturing?</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Can the Minister of State confirm that he believes a priority for the Government is to strip €3 billion to give to the top 20%? The Government has two options. Either it doubles down once again and pledges to tear strips off the tax base as Brexit and a downturn loom or it performs a U-turn and tells us what we all know. As with Fine Gael's equally ridiculous promise to abolish the universal social charge, USC, this is another risky and soon to be broken promise. While the Government is using the public finances as a Fine Gael election tool, people wake up to the news that housing in half of the counties in the State is unaffordable. Before we get to Brexit, a downturn and another lecture about fiscal prudence, the Government should note that day-to-day life is already unaffordable for vast sections of the public. With tougher days on the horizon, there is one question families across the State need the Government to answer. Is this recovery and resurgent economy what people have been told to wait for? We have historically high rents, extortionate childcare costs and public services that are simply unfit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Despite constant warnings from Sinn Féin and others, the Government has continued to waste our public finances on handouts for the wealthy. The bailed out banks still enjoy a ludicrous tax holiday. The Government has allowed vultures and property funds feeding off the housing crisis to avoid hundreds of millions of tax. Hundreds of millions in back taxes from multinational companies continue to accrue. I pointed out earlier this morning that the carer's allowance is taxed. We do not tax the vulture funds but we tax carer's allowance. I had a great deal more to say but I will conclude on that note.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I was struck by a couple of points made by earlier speakers. Senator Victor Boyhan referred to providing the public with a citizens' guide to the budget using simple language. I would like to see an annexe to that guide containing a guide for people with disabilities and their families to show where they will be after this budget, whether up, down or treading water.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell talked about having an eye for and taking into account people on social welfare and those on the margins. I welcome that. It is another issue as to whether the statement and what will follow it actually manage to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Senator Rose Conway-Walsh noted she was the only woman in the Chamber. I believe she meant she was the only female contributor. That got me thinking about Senator McDowell's point that we must have control over spending. Of course we must but how many women, who are more often affected than men, will have control over spending after the budget? They have to consider rent, mortgage, food, children's clothes and so on. What will be left after that? For many people, there may not be anything left to make spending choices about? These are some of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> I attended the national economic dialogue this morning on behalf of the Disability Federation of Ireland. I read the Minister of State's statement and listened to what he said this afternoon. I look at this through the prism of the commitment of the Government to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That means getting on with, and progressive improvement in, the participation and living standards of people with disabilities. I do not feel the love, if I may put it like that, from the foreword to the summer economic statement. It may be implied but it is not overtly stated. I will offer some examples. Living standards have recovered and measures of well-being have improved generally, but not for people with disabilities. I am acutely aware that the scars of the crisis will remain for some time. Many people, to continue the analogy, are still bleeding. They have not got over the crisis to the extent that the wound has become a scar. Access to services in health and some other areas is becoming more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Mention was made of continuing to invest in our infrastructure. Is that our social infrastructure or is it capital and economic infrastructure? The statement does not indicate that this includes the social fabric and infrastructure. Reference is made to sustainably improving living standards, but for whom? Does that include people with disabilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The Minister of State said that, put simply, the Government faces a difficult balancing act in steering the economy and the public finances through a potentially turbulent time. There is no mention of the social infrastructure that was hammered during the recession. The Minister of State went on to emphasise that the Government would still be in a position to fund the roll-out of the national development plan and maintain and improve existing levels of public services. Public services, especially in the health sector for people with disabilities, are hanging on by a shoestring.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Less than one month ago, the new director general of the HSE stated in a memorandum to his staff that the first thing was to hold the line on the budget for this year. He suggested that, come what may, the HSE would not go over-budget. The HSE goes over-budget every year. The reason given for that statement was to regain the confidence and trust of the HSE's funders, namely, the Department of Health and, more particularly, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. How can disabled people understand that statement other than to interpret it as them being left outside while one public body regains the trust and confidence of another public body? That is rather chilling. I will not go into the details but I know there are major pressures in funding disability and health services this year. We had an exposé of these in the Joint Committee on Health last week. The disability services budget did not start off as a balanced budget. There was a deficit of €16 million and there is more than €30 million of a deficit hanging around in organisations that are funded and audited. There are other pressures. Nothing is allowed for demographic pressures this year. There are real issues. We are not now holding still. How are we to ensure that people with disabilities, their families and others are catered for? We can think of many other groups who will finish up on the margins or pushed back.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> One positive and important development in the Oireachtas this year has been the commencement by the Oireachtas disability group of a series of meetings with Secretaries General to discuss a range of issues across different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I studied economics for several years and I have a degree in the subject. I know that we are a small open economy. Even if we did not have Brexit, it would be difficult but now we have all of that too. I know people have to pay their way and that we have to earn our living on the high seas. I also know that we have to keep the fabric of social services intact and in development. I know in particular that early last year the Government and the Dáil made a commitment, for which I am thankful, to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That means the wheels have to keep rolling, maybe not at a magnificent pace but we cannot have them stop either. I am asking for clarity that this will be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">Ar dtús báire, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Senator Dolan's analogy of the high seas is one that we should keep in mind. In welcoming this debate on the summer economic statement, it is now hackneyed, but so true, that Brexit forms the backdrop to this debate but also provides the uncertainty. That means, and I welcome Senator Dolan's remarks, there must be a measured approach. We must be honest in how we approach the budget, whether there is an orderly or a disorderly Brexit, in October. That honesty means that we as politicians cannot be all things to all people. If one were to add up the promises of the Fianna Fáil Party in 2018, which amount to €3.8 billion, and the amounts the Sinn Féin Party has promised, the reality is we would be back to the days of a decade ago where we had 15% unemployment, we could not get money and we were in an economic bailout. I was in a party of Government that made decisions to rescue, with the people, our country. We took decisions that were in the interests of the people about whom Senator Dolan speaks. They are the people we are trying to work for and with. I perish the thought of returning to those days because I can assure Members that many of us have the emotional and mental scars of that time, of being a backbench member of that party in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I challenge Members to come in here and have a debate about the integrity of budgetary proposals, and to be honest. We can adopt the tax, spend and promise everything approach, but where would it get us? We know where it got us. Now we have a budget surplus. Unemployment is at 4.5%, down from the 15%. Following the decade we have come from, there must be a genuine adherence to the fiscal rules and to the remarks of the fiscal advisory council, the ESRI and others. I would make the point that the commentary in some cases is lazy and populist. Now is not the time to turn our country back into a casino and play with the money, which is the taxpayers' money and money we have to borrow. Our economy is not a casino. The house always win, but in our case the house is not Government; it is beyond our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Now is the time for sound budgetary operations where we invest, as Senator Dolan rightly said, in public services and where we can benefit those who are most in need, whether it is the carer, the person with a disability or those who need respite care. In this context, disability must be an important part of the budget we frame in October. We have €2.8 billion of a budgetary proposal and €0.7 billion to spend. It is about balancing the budget. It is about being honest and ensuring right is done for the people and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> However, what happens if there is a no-deal Brexit? We cannot merely walk away from that right now. It is neither rhetoric nor an academic exercise for a PhD dissertation. It is a real fact of life. That is why we have two budgetary stories today with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Members mentioned the challenges. We face challenges such as housing, climate action, transport and improving our carbon footprint. We are spending €2.4 billion on housing. We are spending more than €16.8 billion on health and yet today we have people on strike who deserve to be given recompense and recognised for the work they do. How can we balance the budget and be all things to all people? The answer is that one cannot. The answer to that question is that we must be prudent while at the same time recognising that an ghnáth duine - the ordinary person - is important.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I welcome the Minister of State and the summer economic statement. When the previous Government came into office in 2011, the country was literally on its knees and the Republic was in peril. Not too many people understand that now. In the past seven or eight years, Government has managed our finances. As stated earlier, unemployment, after peaking at 16% in 2012, is now below 4.5% and our enterprise-based economy is creating more than 1,500 jobs a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> This Government often gets accused of a false claim that most of the jobs are being created in Dublin and the cities. This could not be further from the truth. Some 150,000 jobs have been created outside Dublin since the start of 2016, surpassing the Government's regional target of 135,000. Nearly seven out of every ten jobs, or 68%, are created outside of Dublin. Unfortunately, there is the threat of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> It is encouraging to note that the Border region is not getting left behind. For example, the number of people in employment increased by 5,800 in the Border region in the past 12 months. This is an annual change of 3%. The unemployment rate for the Border has also dropped to 3.8%, lower than the State average, and the live register numbers have fallen in all five Border counties - Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo and Leitrim - in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I am delighted that in my own region the growing economy has allowed me, as a public representative, to secure vital investment since my party took office in 2011. This investment has helped to deliver a range of flagship projects, including the €60 million Ballaghaderreen bypass; the €20 million investment programme at Roscommon County Hospital; the launch of the emergency aeromedical service, which has saved hundreds of lives; the multi-million euro investment in Lough Key forest; a primary care centre in Boyle; a community nursing unit for Ballinamore; and a new community school in Ballinamore. I also worked to secure funding for the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin bypass and the N61 between Boyle and Roscommon. We are delighted that Sligo has been designated a regional hub, a key economic centre for the north west. With its infrastructure, Sligo is perfectly placed to drive growth in areas such as south Donegal, Sligo county, Leitrim and Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> However, there are issues. The main issue is Brexit. I am back and forth to Westminster and the lack of understanding of the island of Ireland and of the Good Friday Agreement is worrying. I pay tribute to Labour MPs, such as Mr. Tom Watson, and Conservative MPs, such as Mr. Dominic Grieve. Mr. Grieve MP comes from a different perspective than I - I think he comes from the same perspective as Senator Marshall - but he understands the Union and what Brexit could do to it. We are on the same side because we understand it. As he stated, a no-deal Brexit is a catastrophe and he does not want to go down in history as an MP who facilitated this. People are beginning to come to this realisation. I think they understand that. However, we are in the centre of a madness that is effectively a Conservative leadership battle and people will promise whatever one is having oneself to become leader.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The prize is to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. People have to come to their senses because there is no upside to Brexit for the island of Ireland, the United Kingdom or the EU. I hope they will come to their senses eventually. The vast majority of the MPs and Lords at Westminster, if they could get their way, would reverse this awful decision to opt for Brexit. I hope common sense will prevail in the coming weeks and months.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2019-06-26T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I thank the Senators who contributed. I will try to provide answers on as many of the issues raised as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Senator Horkan mentioned the national children's hospital, the broadband plan and other capital projects. I can only give him the 2019 figures that were budgeted for at this time last year. There was current expenditure of €59 billion and capital expenditure of €7.3 billion, with an overall figure of over €65 billion for current and capital expenditure. That is an enormous amount. The two projects to which the Senator referred will be funded over years, one over decades. In terms of the overruns, there will be projects over that period which will cost more than anticipated while others will cost less. I have not really commented much on those two projects. However, the projects with which we do poorly in terms of pricing are those which we do only once. We started the Luas under price because we had not done such a project here previously. When we began work on the Jack Lynch tunnel 20 years ago, we had not done anything similar previously and the project was underpriced by 50%. For Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport, we had not done a project of that type before and it came in over price by 50%. Everybody said the sky was falling and nothing else would happen because of the underpricing. Terminal 2 is a great example. We were told when it opened, close to the peak of the catastrophe that was befalling us, that it would never be used. Six years later, it was full.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> I remind Senators that when they were going around the country looking for votes from the county councillors five years ago, they were told that we would have to knock down all the ghost estates as quickly as possible because there were too many houses. Now we have a housing crisis. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was in this House five years ago and was scoffed at when he stated that our economy would take off like a rocket. Now, our GDP growth is slowing but the economy is still growing at a substantial rate. In fact, ours has been the fastest-growing economy in the European Union for the past four years. Senators must not forget these things. There are cycles. We are trying to judge where we are and where we are going to be in the aftermath of a potentially wild economic shock of a type that has never been measured before. That is extremely difficult. The swing from surplus to deficit is enormous. It is difficult and we are doing the best we can in the context of deciding what we are going to do. We have not hidden any figures. We are putting them all out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> To touch on a couple of other aspects, Senator Horkan also asked about the €700 million expenditure and Senator Conway-Walsh questioned whether that is really the figure. Reference was made to the Christmas bonus. That is funded out of some of the social protection scheme, which is in surplus year on year. It is not a headline figure. That is from where some of the money comes. The social protection budget comprises the biggest departmental expenditure budget of the State. It is funded out of those two aspects and is about €300 million. It does not all come out of current expenditure or a new Estimate during the year. For the past three years, our figures have been ahead of target. We cannot just hold our breath and hope that it is going to be ahead of target. We are doing the best we can to predict the figures. The Department of Finance has been very good in recent years in the context of making such predictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I want to touch on some of the points raised by Senator McDowell. Like Senator Kieran O'Donnell, he referred to the level of indebtedness. We have a constraint in our level of public and private indebtedness. I want to put that on record. We have a higher level of debt than we are comfortable with. Put in context, the level of indebtedness is 100% of GNI* but we are reducing it. We do not use the GDP figures because they do not quite compare fairly with jurisdictions that do not have the same level of foreign direct investment. While our indebtedness is at 100% of GNI*, the European average is 85%. Our gross national debt, which is approximately €205 billion, can be reduced by 5% or so because we have figures on our cash balances, such as the money we have in the banks, our investment there and other moneys potentially coming from NAMA. That brings us to indebtedness of about 95% of GNI*. No matter what way we analyse these figures, our national indebtedness is about 10% higher than the European average and we are not comfortable with that figure. That will remain a constraint should we have to borrow further in the future. Should we have the worst type of Brexit, namely, a wild and disorderly one with no deal, it could potentially mean that we will have to borrow billions in the future. However, we may not have the capacity to do so. Looking at where we are currently, because the Department of Finance, the Oireachtas and the Dáil put a structure in place, the markets are satisfied to lend to us at a rate of approximately 1%. That is quite an achievement when one considers where we were in 2009 or 2010, when the markets would not lend and the State and the people lost their economic sovereignty. Others came in and told us what to do. A programme was agreed and we have emerged from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I want also to consider our level of personal indebtedness. I sat with some Senators on the banking inquiry. From 1997 to 2007, we went from the lowest level of private indebtedness in Europe to the highest. It was inconceivable to think that this was allowed to continue, but it was, and we went from approximately 47% GDP indebtedness to 240%. That is a scandalous and outrageous increase, but those factors do not influence us any more because the level of indebtedness is decreasing, although I accept that it is still too high. The level of private indebtedness is decreasing and that must happen. The public has been doing a number of things in the past decade. It has been paying down loans at a time when doing so has been difficult. It is quite an achievement to bring down that level of private indebtedness in the teeth of an economic storm such as that which we faced over the past decade. The public has done that because it is responsible and people do not want to be in the level of debt that might leave them without financial capacity if another economic shock were to happen. That is being responsible in businesses and privately and the State is doing the same. I am not kicking Fianna Fáil but the Government of which it was part and which was in office between 2004 and 2008 did terrific damage to the State. I am not looking back or rewriting history but it was irresponsible to continue to pursue the expenditure levels and the unsustainable model of taxation that obtained at the time. That irresponsibility led to the catastrophe that happened between 2008 and 2010. In 2011, the new Government came in to try to address it. I give the respect to the Government after 2008, with the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who was the man in charge in the Department of Finance during the period about which I am so critical. That period wiped out the wealth of so many people, large number of whom are still too highly indebted.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">It wiped out those individuals' wealth. With business wealth and private wealth, the banking sector loss in that period was €140 billion wiped out. That was the cost. Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan - Lord have mercy on him - did what was required, which was an enormous recalibration in one budget that was a €6 billion change. It was unheard of and when we look back we can ask how we did it and how it happened. Nobody wants the troughs and spikes to have to do that again. This is what Sinn Féin wants us to do again. There has never been more hypocrisy in Irish politics than what Sinn Féin is pedalling right now. I wanted Senator Conway-Walsh to stay and listen to what I am saying. Sinn Féin wants the Government to tax, tax, tax more and more, and spend, spend, spend more and more. That cannot happen. That has been tried during the period 2004 to 2010. It is not credible to do what Sinn Féin wants us to do. We cannot do it. There would be troughs and spikes. People would lose their wealth again and lose the expenditures that we want to put into services because the health budget and the social protection budget would be cut, possibly by €20 billion. If we have to go back to Sinn Féin's version of things a massive cut would happen and health is the next biggest expenditure item. I put it to the Senator that Fine Gael does not want to do that and I think she knows that. I have always said that we do not have everything right but we have not got everything wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The infrastructural plans are ambitious. We need more public housing and we are spending more on this than ever before with €2.4 billion funding. There is a challenge in doing this that we add to the prospect of overheating the economy. Again, we are trying to do a balancing act. Senator McDowell referred to a responsive electoral cycle and this is what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The Taoiseach has a strong personal view on tax cuts for medium earners. There are very few jurisdictions where people who earn the average industrial wage are in the higher tax brackets. When one adds in social protection payments the Irish higher tax bracket is 59%. How does a person who earns just over €35,000 go into that tax bracket? In the UK a person can earn £50,000 before he or she gets into the 50% tax bracket. It is a huge drag in trying to get foreign direct investment companies of every hue and colour to establish in Ireland, and the one reason is that the level of personal tax here is higher than in most other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> On another aspect of personal tax - and Senator Rose Conway-Walsh and Sinn Féin's farcical tax analysis - the tax take on income has doubled in quantum from the lowest point to where we are now in 2019. It has gone from €11 billion to €22 billion. That is an enormous doubling in a short period of time. I have made the point on the floor of this House previously, that this could not happen in any other jurisdiction, but it has happened here. The income tax take in Ireland from those on the average wage is too high and Fine Gael is trying to do something about that. During last November's Fine Gael conference the Taoiseach made the point that we will do this if the tax revenue's allow, but if they do not then it might take longer. We will be careful in the upcoming budget and we will deal with people as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Senator Boyhan spoke of budget transparency. There has been a huge improvement. Many of us remember the era when it was crash, bang, wallop and it all happened on one day and everything was a State secret until the morning. Given where we started we now have the stability programme update, SPU, and the summer economic statement, with papers having been put in place. We also have the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC. Deputy Michael Noonan has been quoted. IFAC is there to do a job, which is to scrutinise what we are doing economically, and it is doing that. IFAC had some harsh things to say but that is its job. Our job in the Department of Finance is to listen and take on board what IFAC says, and we do. IFAC also said that a lot of things were being done correctly, but this was not reported at all. This, however, is the manner of reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Reference was made to public understanding of debt and the budget. I believe this is a good plan and how to present the information in such a way that the public will understand it easier and better is something we could take into consideration. I will be honest with Senators that I was in the Oireachtas for a couple of years before I could get my head around the arithmetic on budget day. I am not sure that anybody who says they are able to very quickly understand it all is telling the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke about indebtedness. I put it to the Sinn Féin Senators that 2.3 million people are currently working in the State. We have never had 2.3 million people working before. This is an outstanding achievement. This Government got people back to work who potentially had no prospect of getting back to work. We are close to full employment and it is absolutely outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I also want to touch on some important aspects. We have to continue our capital projects now and in the future. The first victim of the 2004-2008 Government was the capital budgets, which nearly stopped. That was a mistake. That spending should have continued. It is, however, easy to look back now and be wise with hindsight. Capital projects should have been funded and the M20 should have been built by now. The M20 will not just connect Cork and Limerick, it will also connect Cork with Galway. These are our second, third and fourth biggest cities. I am aware that some people think it is wrong to build roads and motorways but I absolutely disagree with that. Ireland is a large island with a small number of people and now we are better at transporting people around it. It is important to get those types of infrastructure projects over the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The corporate tax analysis will be presented within weeks. We have to present that analysis and if one looks at where Ireland has come from a number of years ago it has gone from €4 billion to €10 billion. This is a result of the changes made by this Government on the corporate tax analysis. It will not change from the headline rate. Senators Ó Donnghaile and Conway-Walsh have left the Chamber but I would put it to them that populism is dangerous. We see where populism has got the UK with Brexit. We must be careful to call out the Sinn Féin strategy, which is the old Fianna Fáil strategy and it is wrong. I am not having a go at Fianna Fáil but the mistakes of the past have been learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I find it a little amusing that Eir presented its numbers for the broadband plan of some €3 billion. Then they were through. I think it is great that Eir is able to do it now for €1 billion. An aspect of this certainly needs to stand up to scrutiny. If it is €1 billion now why was it not €1 billion when Eir presented its plan for €3 billion when the tender went in?</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> On the €700 million and Senator Dolan's query, there is a figure for demographics. There is €700 million in unallocated funding but the €2.1 billion package, which is allocated, has €500 million for demographics. As our population increases and as more people require health and education, €500 million is pre-built into that. There is €400 million for the public sector pay deal, which is agreed and in place. Some €300 million is allocated for carry-over costs from the figures calculated to start in 2019 but which will flow into 2020. When one adds up this €500 million, €400 million and €300 million one can see that much of the €2.1 billion that is allocated is allocated for demographics, for the public sector pay deal and for carry-over costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">A significant part of it will be forward spent. The €700 million has not been allocated but that will be done by the Government, with the agreement of Fianna Fáil, under the confidence and supply arrangement. That is to be done between now and the budget, based on what the Taoiseach expects to happen in the context of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> In light of Senator Dolan's suggestion, I will request that the Department of Finance consider a citizens' guide for people with disabilities. He spoke about people living on the edge. Some people want to paint Fine Gael as a mad, right-wing party. Fine Gael is a centrist party. Most politics is fought in the centre and most centrists have a bit of left and a bit of right. It is easy to paint people in one way but at least most parties in our jurisdiction operate in the centre. I support that because I believe it is the right way when compared with the politics of other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> Even during the financial crisis, the €20 billion social protection budget was maintained. That was quite an achievement. As I have often noted, very few jurisdictions could have brought in €11 billion in income tax and paid out €20 billion social protection payments in the teeth of that crisis. It was done to protect people on the edge. There remains a budget of €20 billion to protect those people and a budget of €17 billion for health. To put that in context, another €8 billion will be spent on the private health budget. When that is calculated by adding the two figures and dividing the sum by the number of people in the State, we spend more in Ireland on health than most other OECD countries. The amount is not the issue but rather how we spend it. As I have stated on dozens of occasions, it is difficult to reform a sector when people choose not to allow that reform to happen at the pace required.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> On public services and social infrastructure, the latter comprises the social protection budget and the health budget. As already stated, I am pleased that most people in Ireland operate in the centre rather than to the hard left or hard right. That is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> I have spoken for longer than I anticipated. In summary, we are in a very volatile period and that is how it will remain for some time. The British Conservative Party will elect a new leader at the end of July. I predict that the month of August will be extremely volatile. In September, the month in which party conferences are held in the UK, events will be even more volatile. That will be a better time for us to try to secure a deal between the UK and the European Union. I do not know if that will be possible but we must try. It has been very pleasing that, in the conversation on Brexit, Ireland has shown the benefit for a small nation of being supported by a continent during a difficult period. The other 26 member states of the EU have been superb in their support of Ireland. It is appreciated and we are grateful for it. I anticipate that the support will remain and may even get bigger and better. Many Brexiteers have been surprised by that because the expectation was the opposite. It was expected that Brexit would start the downfall of the EU but, in a peculiar and semi-perverse way, it has strengthened it. Brexit has shown Ireland and the other small member states, of which there are many more than the larger ones, the benefit of being in a club and of being supported by a continent rather than being isolated and having the potential to be picked off when faced with difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Ireland faces difficult circumstances. We have not hidden the figures; they are there for all to see. This could be a very disruptive period but we have the support of the EU and the Prime Ministers of 26 other member states. While there will be new Presidents and while a new Council, Commission and European Central Bank will be appointed, all those Prime Ministers have nonetheless supported our Prime Minister. The support of this Chamber, of parties generally in both Chambers and that which the Taoiseach has received show how much better it is to operate as a united group rather than with parties split or divided and causing disruption, as has been seen in the UK.</p>
