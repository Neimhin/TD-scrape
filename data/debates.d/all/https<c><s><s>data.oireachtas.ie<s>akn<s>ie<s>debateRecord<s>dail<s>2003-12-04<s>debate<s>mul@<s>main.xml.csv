#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the implications for employment and the economy in the Westmeath area with the announcement that Penn Racquet Sports Limited is to close its plant in Mullingar, County Westmeath, with the loss of 116 staff, and the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the steps she intends to take to try to avert this loss of jobs or to secure alternative employment.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I welcome the Taoiseach to the Chamber today. It is a pleasant surprise on a Thursday morning. Perhaps he is here because of the job losses in Mullingar.I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the serious implications for employment in Westmeath and the economy generally of the announcement by Penn Racquet Sports Limited that it is to close its plant in Mullingar, County Westmeath, with the loss of 116 jobs, and the urgent need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to set out the steps she intends to take to try to avert this loss of jobs or the measures she intends to take to secure alternative employment.

Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 11b, 11 cand 12, motion re referral to committees of proposed approval by Dáil of the draft Council decision concerning the signature of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, agreed?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	No. 12 is a motion to approve a Council decision concerning an agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway. It allows for the provisions of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters to apply in this case. There are very serious ramifications involved in this extension, particularly in the area of extra-State surveillance of individual citizens or people who have made this jurisdiction their home. This includes the right of application for telecommunications monitoring by another State of citizens in this State.There are very serious matters that must be properly addressed. This matter was referred to committee only on Tuesday of this week, with a very cursory examination of it, and, as with so many of these propositions in the past, the so-called EU scrutiny that we allegedly exercise in this House is not being applied. It is absolute nonsense. We do not have the opportunity to scrutinise it. We have no report back from Tuesday's brief committee deliberations. The great majority of Members of this House therefore have no idea of what is involved in the detail of the proposition before us. To allow this to go through without further detailed scrutiny and debate in this House before determining a decision is irresponsible in the extreme.I am not standing here merely for the sake of offering an objection. On numerous occasions I have made the point regarding the process of EU scrutiny. The approach to this work is very flawed. I appeal to the Taoiseach to regard this as a priority for address in the new year. This cannot continue because we do not know the extent of the effects on the civil and human rights of our citizens of measures we are adopting in this House. I must protest and can do so only by recording my opposition to this measure proceeding at this stage without debate.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I rise to oppose this matter. The EU scrutiny sub-committee has examined over 400 items in the 12 months since the procedure was set up last October. Some Ministers and Departments have been better than others in co-operating with the committee. Under a law passed by this House and the Seanad, the committee is due to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the workings of EU scrutiny up to 31 December. While there has been a great improvement in the way we do our business, in scrutinising regulations and directives in advance, there are continuing difficulties – for example, some draft decisions have not been sent for consideration.The sub-committee met this morning at 9.30 a.m. and will meet again in two weeks' time. The members are working extremely hard and refer to other committees matters for more detailed consideration. There are resource issues – for example, a staff member seconded from the Department of the Taoiseach was removed and not replaced. I understand there are difficulties relating to Ireland's EU Presidency. The Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs have tried to co-operate, but there are difficulties. These difficulties will be reported to the House in the new year and I hope the House will provide an opportunity to consider them and to deal with any hiatus that exists. Though much progress has been made, more needs to be made.

I acknowledge that a report came back from the Chair, but I understand that became available only yesterday evening. Notice of one or two days is not sufficient to allow discussion of such a detailed and technical matter that may well have serious ramifications for the monitoring of communications in this and other countries.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I appreciate the points made by Deputy Mitchell. New work and new procedures were involved and we have improved, and will continue to improve, our handling of it. Regarding what Deputies Ó Caoláin and Cuffe said, this matter was fully debated this week by the sub-committee. It is about extending to Norway and Iceland Schengen rules on mutual legal assistance. A report was prepared by the committee, but I am not sure where it is.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	There was a report. I emphasise that committees are fully operational. Deputy Ó Caoláin's party is larger now than previously. I could understand his position when he was the sole representative of his party in the last Dáil, but there are now a number of representatives of his party and he will just have to make arrangements to send somebody to these meetings.

Somebody from the Deputy's party should attend these meetings because it is their duty to do so.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I do not wish to divide the House on this matter, we do not need another vote, but if the House is to have Friday sittings in the new term, provision ought to be made for the Order of Business, Leaders' Questions and Question Time, otherwise it is not a meaningful convention of the House.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The matter of tomorrow's sitting is running into the sand. I object to the imposition of a guillotine. This is a matter on which Members wish to speak and sufficient time has not been made available. I therefore object to the proposal.

Another issue is being rushed through the House and Members did not have full sight of the implications. The imposition of a guillotine means there will not be a proper debate and the House will not be informed of the full implications of an important Bill.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I, like others, welcome the return of the Taoiseach to the House on a Thursday morning. I hope it heralds more attendances by him on Thursdays. In respect of yesterday's budget statement by the Minister for Finance, there are 11 tax relief schemes, some which are being extended while others are new. How many of those schemes will require notification to the European Commission, or has the Government had discussions with the Commission to ascertain whether approval for them will be forthcoming?

This followed an earlier request from Newry and Mourne District Council. In the light of growing public support and demand for such legislation, when does the Taoiseach propose to accommodate all-Ireland participation in future presidential contests?

I understand that some elements of the plan will require legislation so perhaps he will outline the specifics of that. When will we see the Civil Registration Bill to allow for the decentralisation of the General Registry Office to Roscommon town, which was promised by the Government over 12 years ago? I hope that does not mean that the next round will take another 12 years.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The Civil Registration Bill has been published and I am sure Second Stage will come before the House shortly.

Following the Council of Ministers' failure to agree on regulating embryonic stem cell research yesterday, the Tánaiste said this country is in a state of limbo on the issue.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	116	This is a budget for a strongly growing Irish economy. With our massive decentralisation programme, the Government will ensure that growth is properly distributed around the country.The benefits of the budget changes are concentrated on people and families in the lower income groups, whether at work or in receipt of welfare payments and pensions from the State. This is without argument a socially progressive budget and exposes once again the hollow ideological myth that this is a right-wing Government which cares only for the better-off.There is strong evidence of a pick-up in the international economy, especially in the United States, which now exercises a significant influence on our economic fortunes. This recovery is taking place against the background of historically low interest rates.We have come through the international downturn of the past three years in remarkably good shape. Employment here has continued to grow, even if much more slowly. It is estimated that there will be an additional net 17,000 jobs this year, which should increase by 23,000 more in 2004. Unemployment hovers around a quite remarkable 4.5% to 5%; inflation is expected to average no more than 2.5% in 2004, and should fall below 2% for part of it. We are well in line with the rest of Europe. The indirect tax increases in the budget add minimally to inflation, 0.4% next year, or less than half the previous budget; and our public finances are the envy of Europe. We have the second lowest general Government debt/GDP ratio apart from Luxembourg, and borrowing will not exceed 1.1 % of GDP in 2004, or about one third of the permissible Growth and Stability Pact ceiling. The Exchequer returns for end-November were better than expected, and it now appears that the general Government balance this year will come in at around €600 million, which is nearly €300 million less than forecast. While there are always swings and roundabouts in terms of revenue receipts under different headings, tax receipts overall this year will come in some €100 million ahead of budget. This reflects a fair degree of resilience in the Irish economy, but also the particular success of some of the Minister's provisions last year, especially regarding capital gains tax.The truest line in the Minister for Finance's speech is the one which states: "Borrowing is the real stealth tax". Those who propose a much higher level of borrowing can have no long-term commitment to maintaining the low tax rates we have achieved in this country. They are the key to full employment and competitiveness. It would not be in our national interest to press up against the Growth and Stability Pact ceiling of 3% GDP or to breach it. As a small country, it is not in our interest to have any doubts hanging over the soundness of our economic management. We would still be interested in altering the treatment of the more costly long-term public private partnership projects, which at present are compressed by the European statistics office into a single year's expenditure for general Government borrowing purposes. That is one aspect at present that is a significant constraint. EUROSTAT rules could also be much clearer but that is being worked upon.Up to 1987, a third of all tax revenue went in debt servicing. Is it any wonder that tax rates then were crippling, with very little money available to improve services or infrastructure or relieve poverty? In 2004, little more than 7% of tax revenue and 7% of net current expenditure will be required to service our debt. That is a dramatic sea-change.In 1997, the annual cost of debt servicing peaked in absolute money terms at €3.5 billion. Next year, it will be €2.4 billion. Our financial indebtedness, which six years ago was still above the EU average under the rainbow coalition, has improved significantly since, with the general Government debt halved as a percentage of GDP.What all this means is that we can look forward to entering a period of resumed economic growth, carrying no additional baggage in terms of debt to hamper our progress. Even with the scaling down of EU receipts and a tighter budgetary situation, we are still able to sustain the dramatically increased level of current expenditure on services and of capital spending on infrastructure we achieved during the Celtic tiger years. In the past, more difficult economic circumstances would have brought about sharp retrenchment with a negative impact across the board. What is remarkable about the past two years is how small the adjustments have been compared to previously.Budget 2004 is a budget of hope but it is also based on economic reality, and it reflects some basic facts. First, Ireland is part of a monetary union where monetary policy is focused on ensuring low inflation and where exchange rates are effectively outside of our domestic control; second, international competition is exerting downward pressures on goods prices and is likely to continue to do so; third, we are one of the most open economies in the world; and, fourth, international competition for jobs and investment is becoming more intense all the time.Everybody today accepts the vital importance of bringing our infrastructure up to the best European standards. What this requires is not a short extra spurt followed by a hard slamming on of the brakes, as happened in the past, but a consistent high level of expenditure that ensures we get the best value for money. It is a crucial difference between Ireland and Europe's longer developed economies that we have to spend a substantially higher proportion of our national wealth on infrastructure. The Government has committed itself to capital investment of €33.6 billion over the next five years, of which a conservative €2.4 billion will come from PPPs. The 10% leeway, which Departments can carry over, means that the exact timing of payments will not act as a distraction. It is steady, consistent investment that will gradually enable us to overcome step by step our infrastructure deficit. While we may be conscious of how much there is to be done, our neighbours in Northern Ireland are impressed at how much we are now able to do. Once again this situation is different from that of the past.It is in the nature of capital investment that there is some time lag before we see the full benefits and considerable interim disruption often occurs. The motorway from Dublin to Dundalk is complete and is a major boost for the Dublin-Belfast corridor, which also has an excellent train service. Next week, the Kildare bypass will open and the week after that, a significant increase in public transport capacity will be reflected in the new train timetable. Within two years, the Dublin Port tunnel and the Dublin motorway ring road will be completed.I remind those commentators and public representatives who are constantly on the ideological warpath against the Government that a high level of public expenditure on investment is the hallmark of an enlightened and progressive Government. It was certainly never a defining characteristic of right-wing Governments, outside of defence. Exchequer capital expenditure next year will be nearly three times that of 1997. The two Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments have given priority to the radical improvements we so clearly require.Schools are as much a vital part of our infrastructure as roads. The Book of Estimates increased expenditure on substandard national school buildings, of which there are many, by €23 million to €190 million. I am glad we have been able to allocate a further €30 million in the budget to both the primary and secondary sector, making available an additional €55 million altogether next year compared to 2003. Our children deserve nothing less.Our critics inside and outside the House divide into two camps, those in the Fine Gael Party who claim we are, and have been, spending too much and the Labour Party and most of the Independents who argue we have been spending too little.The gradual slowdown in the public spending profile has had remarkably beneficial effects. A sharp downturn in the economy began in the second quarter of 2001. The rate of public expenditure increase in 2001 and 2002, including the substantial increase in public service numbers, exerted a counter-cyclical effect, as noted by the IMF and OECD in their reports earlier this year, and helped ensure a soft landing. Equally, in their view, the reins were tightened at the right time this year. The bottom line is that as we approach a likely upturn after three years of downturn, we are in a surprisingly strong economic and fiscal position. This should not be a matter of criticism but of praise, which is the case.I have been conscious of what the IMF has had to say about Ireland for many decades, and I will cite again what it said last August: "Directors commended the Irish authorities for their exemplary track record of sound economic policies, which have resulted in a dynamic, open and robust economy – with growth noticeably above the EU average over the past decade – and resilience to external shocks."  One cannot get much higher praise than this from a notoriously tough-minded international body such as the IMF, which is well known for taking no prisoners. Its words carry more weight with me than all the criticisms of Opposition finance spokespersons.The Estimates provide for the payment of benchmarking, which will cost €305 million this year. The principle of the exercise has been praised by the OECD, which has stated we should do more of it. In 2002 it delivered the best year of industrial peace for many decades and freed us at last from the bane of relativities. The verification bodies are active. I cannot take seriously the notion that the Fine Gael Party would repudiate its obligations if it were in government, or that it would ever be allowed to do so by the Labour Party. I remember when Deputy John Bruton opposed the Programme for Competitiveness and Work in 1994, but quickly jumped to attention once he became Taoiseach. No one should be under the slightest illusion that this would happen again under any other Fine Gael Party leader.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Social partnership has served this country well for 16 years. It is a unique and crucial part of our recent economic and social development, which has helped provide stability as well as a consistent and coherent policy framework. It allows us to work together to solve problems. I believe in and remain committed to social partnership and this budget will help to underpin its continuing success.Together with benchmarking and the tax provisions of the budget, low inflation of 2.5% this year will provide the backdrop to the second half of the public service pay agreement, which remains to be negotiated as part of the current partnership programme. The need to remain competitive is a widely acknowledged concern given current circumstances and there is a perception of some slippage, which will need to be corrected if it is not to have serious consequences.It is wise and prudent to address the pension arrangements for new entrants to the public service long before the issue becomes acute. Many of the difficulties facing some of the major continental economies today are because they have put off the evil day and allowed the problem to become worse and worse. The prospect of more flexible retirement conditions will, I am sure, be a welcome prospect to today's entrants into the public service, but may also be vital if more generous social provisions for retirement are to be sustainable in the long run.A major plank of the budget, which also directly affects the public service, is decentralisation to 53 towns and cities. Decentralisation is, or should be, welcomed throughout Ireland as it will relieve some of the significant pressure on Dublin and spread wealth to other parts of the country. Decentralisation is not only directed to hubs and gateways, but also to substantial towns in the hinterland which have attractive but under-utilised amenities and, in most cases, good infrastructure and access. Many of these towns will greatly benefit from the tremendous fillip decentralisation will give them.There is no town without councillors from many parties and none, and in nearly every case the campaign for decentralisation has been a combined community effort with all-party support. Nevertheless, as Government parties, we are fulfilling with great satisfaction a major and long-standing promise. This will be an ongoing policy with regard to the location of future Government offices or services and we have by no means exhausted all the possibilities. Even in the current round, not all of the locations have yet been decided on. In general principle, new agencies will be directed outside Dublin.This policy is based on solid experience. Earlier rounds of decentralisation, including 4,000 jobs decentralised when I was Minister for Finance in the early 1990s, were a great success. This initiative is a more fundamental shift. Modern communications make it unnecessary to have all Departments working in Dublin. The move will be voluntary and career possibilities for those who move out of Dublin will be just as good as for those who stay. In many cases, they will also enjoy a better quality of life.Savings as well as costs are involved from the point of view of Government. The success of the programme will require the co-operation of the public service and its union representatives. We look forward to progressive implementation supervised by an implementation committee reporting to a Cabinet sub-committee.Arguments are often made that we have a low rate of public expenditure relative to GNP by European standards and that this is the reason our public services are deficient in many respects. On the contrary, the manner in which we have managed our economy has maximised the amount we have available to spend, which has increased considerably in virtually every sector. At the Kenmare economic workshop this autumn it was convincingly demonstrated that when all relevant aspects were taken into account, our level of public spending is fully in line with the European average. These aspects include significantly less defence spending, less debt servicing, a favourable demographic and dependency profile and a low level of unemployment.The objectives of this budget, as set out by the Minister for Finance, are entirely in line with the priorities in our programme for Government and the objectives we agreed with the social partners in Sustaining Progress. There, we agreed that the central macro-economic objective was to consolidate recent progress, achieve a medium-term growth rate to sustain high levels of employment and facilitate the evolution of a more equal society. This is to be done by securing low inflation, sustainable public finances and social, economic and environmental sustainability.We have reflected these priorities under Sustaining Progress, in particular in the commitment to fairness in the budget provisions. This is particularly clear from the focus of our resources on those on the minimum wage, which is to be substantially increased next February, reducing the relative burden of income tax on those on average incomes and below, and improving the income position of elderly taxpayers.The reform which introduced tax credits in 1998 enables us to target tax concessions much more effectively than previously, when the greatest benefit frequently went to the top of the chain. The tax tables in yesterday's budget booklet show an exemplary profile in terms of equity. Having listened to the Labour Party's spokesperson on finance, Deputy Burton, yesterday, what the Labour Party seems to want could invert that profile.In line with our commitments in Sustaining Progress, this budget makes substantial and tangible progress in ensuring that people have resources and opportunities to live life with dignity and have access to the quality public services that underpin life chances and experiences. In line with this commitment, the Government has already agreed to increase the national minimum wage to €7 per hour, with effect from 1 February 2004. The budget for 2004 ensures that the position we first achieved in 2002, where 90% of the minimum wage annualised was made exempt from taxation, is maintained in 2004 for the higher figure. That is a major achievement which requires substantial resources.The increase in the employee credit, or PAYE credit as it is also known, in the budget means that, from January next, a single PAYE worker will not pay tax on income less than €246 per week, which is equivalent to €12,800 per year. To put the figures in context, when the Government entered office in 1997, the first €98 of weekly income only was tax free. We have raised the entry point to taxation by more than 150% since 1997, which is more than five times inflation over the period.The budget for 2004 also raises the age exemption limits under which those aged 65 and over are exempt from taxation for the third year in a row. For 2004, the limits are €15,500 in the case of a single or widowed person and €31,000 in the case of a married couple where one is or both are aged 65 or over. This represents a total increase over three years of almost 44%, which is four times inflation in the same period. In this way, we are more than helping to protect the real value of incomes for pensioners on lower incomes.As a result of these changes in 2004, 35% of all those on the tax record will not pay any tax. Since 1997, average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer, including those on lower incomes. After the budget for 2004, the average tax rate for a person on the average industrial wage will be 10% lower than it was in 1997. As a result of the budget for 2004, the percentage of the income tax yield coming from those earning the average industrial wage or less is 6%, compared with more than 14% in 1997. That is a 57% reduction.This is the answer to our critics, and the comparison does not reflect well on the Labour Party's record in Government in particular. The European Commission has on previous occasions commented that our tax system treats those on low incomes more favourably than any other EU country. It would have been desirable, if it could have been easily done, to extend the standard rate band as well. We hope to catch up on that when circumstances improve further and we have more latitude.Low direct tax rates, both in personal and corporate taxes, have been a key factor in generating growth and employment. The long-standing Government policy of low corporation tax rates has been vital in attracting foreign direct investment in the manufacturing area. It has also been a big element in making the IFSC in the Dublin docklands area a major success story, with direct employment of almost 11,000 jobs, and also contributing substantial Government revenue. It is important for Ireland to remain competitive in attracting highly mobile foreign direct investment and to develop high quality jobs in multinational domestic sectors. We know the importance of using tax effectively as an economic instrument and thus the importance of retaining national control in this area. The recent dispute between the European Commission and France and Germany over the Stability and Growth Pact was not just about large versus small countries, but also about all EU Governments having the right, within limits, to determine their own budgetary decisions.Our 2004 budget contains several initiatives in the tax area of great importance to business investment in this country. First, there is a proposed new tax credit to encourage companies to increase their expenditure on qualifying research and development activities, which will help to move Irish manufacturing employment up the value chain.Second, a special exemption is being introduced in the capital gains code where a holding company disposes of a shareholding in a subsidiary company. This relief exists in several other EU countries and the aim behind its introduction here is to encourage multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters and holding companies in Ireland, which should benefit the IFSC. We will then be virtually the only EU country to have both low corporation tax rates and company holding relief.Third, the business expansion and seed capital schemes, which are an important source of finance for small and start-up companies, are being renewed for another three years to the end of 2006. The extension of these two schemes for a further three years and the increased company limit of €1 million will continue to help such businesses bridge the financial gap they experience.The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost €630 million in a full year, which is a substantial increase of €100 million on last year's budget package. This should correct the misrepresentation that has been peddled about social welfare cutbacks. The €630 million figure for this year stands in favourable comparison to the €273 million in the rainbow coalition's last budget in 1997. In 2004 the personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit will be increased by €10 to €134.80. In its last budget, the rainbow parties increased this by only €3.81 to €85.73. Other key positives in the budget for 2004 include an increase in family income supplement income thresholds by €28 per week, with a €7 increase in the minimum payment; an increase in the respite care grant to €835 per annum from June 2004; and an increase in the widowed parent grant to €2,700 from budget day.All our budgets since 1997 have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people in society as regards pensions. After the large increases of the early 1980s, their relative position had fallen back and needed a sustained boost to lift them above the poverty level once again. At the 1997 general election, we promised to increase all old age pensions to at least €127 per week over the term of the Government. We more than delivered on this commitment. At the 2002 general election, we promised to increase the State pension to €200 per week. The budget for 2004 puts us well on track to deliver on this commitment. It provides for a €10 per week increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions.People with short political memories will not forget that, over the three budgets of the rainbow coalition, the Labour Party Minister for Finance and the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare gave pensioners an average increase of €2.95. In contrast, the average increase to pensioners under the budgets by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, now stands at a substantial €9.75. In monetary terms, the statistics are even more stark. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at €167.30 per week. This is a monumental increase on the €99 per week which was the payable rate on the day the much vaunted champions of social justice in Fine Gael and the Labour Party left office. Other pension increases are, for example, the over 66 widow or widower's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit which will increase by €11.50 per week.In 2004 all other personal weekly rates will increase by €10 per week. This will benefit almost 1 million people who claim a weekly social welfare payment, and that will extend to 1.5 million when their dependants are included. I am happy that this substantial increase will apply in full to more than 400,000 on the lower rates of weekly social welfare payment, which is an increase of more than three times the expected rate of inflation. This includes those in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and allowance, pre-retirement allowance, one parent family payments, carer's benefit and allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. We are committed to making substantial improvements in the income position of those on the lower social welfare rates, in line with our policy under Sustaining Progress of achieving the income adequacy targets under the national anti-poverty strategy.Building on the substantial increases we have devoted to child benefit this year, we are announcing an additional €80 million in a full year to increase this vital support further. Child benefit rates will increase by €6 per month for the first and second child and by €8 per month for third and subsequent children. To appreciate the scale of child benefit increases under the Government, it is worth emphasising that, when we returned to Government in June 1997, child benefit was payable at a rate of €38.09 per month for the first and second child and at €49.52 for the third child and subsequent children. The increases and the greater priority Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit means that, following the budget of 2004, child benefit will now be payable at a rate of €131.60 for the first and second child, and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. This means that the rate of child benefit payment has increased by three and a half times the figure it was on the day we first took office.This has been a good budget for agriculture and rural Ireland, also taking into account the Book of Estimates. A lot more money has been provided for REPS and farm forestry. There is now also income tax relief for farm leasing and a number of farm-related schemes are being extended. The new rural social scheme will add 2,500 to the jobs provided under the continuing community employment and related schemes. There were fears that, regardless of the social value of the schemes to the community and the role they provided for older people with limited alternative skills, they were going to be drastically scaled down or phased out because of expert reports. On the contrary, their important role is fully recognised and protected by the Government.The extension of film relief for an additional four years, with a strong caution about the avoidance of abuse, is a further positive initiative in the budget. We are not in the business of driving high-risk, high-profile mobile investment out of the country, particularly in areas where we have demonstrated we have a comparative advantage and can perform to world-class standards.In conclusion, I am very satisfied that the 2004 budget fulfils our responsibilities and will set the country a further step along the road to secure greater prosperity, greater social inclusion and a more even distribution of our economic gains between all segments of society. Our programme for Government states, and we believe, that this generation has a unique opportunity to build a fair society of equal opportunity and sustained prosperity. We recognise the need to invest in modernised public services, to develop our infrastructure and to help those who are least well-off. We pledged that in 2007, Ireland would be a country transformed from the Ireland we found ten years before.Rather than quoting, as I promised, from this centre-left Government—

I will quote him exactly, to avoid harming the “old left”. He stated:The combination of the tax and welfare measures means the gains from budget 2004 are firmly focused on the poorer sections of society. An analysis in the budget documents . . .  shows that the poorest 30% of the population will receive increases in disposable income of between 5.7% and 7%. Meanwhile, the top 30% will gain by between 0.4% and 0.9%.My case stands.

Perhaps he might have done better to choose one of those as many of his quotes are absolutely meaningless.This is a classic three-card trick, the ultimate diversion. These are real Fianna Fáil tactics. I notice that in the Taoiseach's quote from the economics editor of The Irish Times, on the benefits to the less well-off, that in the final page of the Taoiseach's speech, before the quotation, he refers to, “the increases and the greater priority Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit”. There is no mention of the keepers of the public conscience who have been abandoned over here and have been left out and forgotten.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	152	All we ever said about benchmarking was that it should be renegotiated. If there is one thing the Irish people will face, it is the truth. This was done in secrecy without publishing the verification figures and without being able to identify what the increases in efficiency and better value in public services would be. It is the cause of the whole rumpus in this House. It is going to cost €1.2 billion a year. The Government says it will pay it, but I am disappointed there has not been openness and accountability on the value of the public money that the taxpayer is raising.I notice the Taoiseach says he is worried that a Fine Gael-Labour Government might repudiate this. On the fifth page of his speech he seems to be assuming that this change is about to take place, would that it will in the shortest possible space of time.This budget should have addressed three fundamental issues. It should have protected and improved the competitiveness of this economy. It should have delivered reforms that would ensure value for taxpayers' money, and it should have targeted available resources where they are needed most. Has the Minister for Finance measured up to these criteria?Competitiveness is not a vague concept. It is critical for the creation and retention of jobs. Where do we stand now on competitiveness? One of the best sources the Taoiseach could have cited is the Government's own competitiveness council. What did it conclude on where we stand? It stated we are 15th out of 16 countries on prices and wages; 15th out of 16 on infrastructure; 11th out of 16 on IT; 15th out of 16 on transport; and 12th out of 16 on research. It also stated that Ireland is the joint most expensive country in the eurozone for consumer goods. This is perfectly evident from the hundreds of replies and comments we have been received on a website we ourselves launched on this subject – www.ripoff.ie– where consumers are now giving evidence of their stories on a daily basis.On a per capita basis, we are ranked as the fourth most expensive country out of 16 for insurance premiums. Our industrial electricity costs are the third most expensive out of nine countries. These are not my words but the comments made by the National Competitiveness Council, which was set up by the Government. I did not notice any mention of this in the remarks of the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach.This is a damning indictment of the way the Government has conducted business on behalf of the people. Incompetence in financial management is the hallmark of the Government. The waste of taxpayers' money on capital projects that are far over budget and behind time borders on the negligent. Every week the Committee of Public Accounts calls in groups, organisations and Departments about taxpayers' money that has been wasted on projects that were delivered neither on time nor on budget. For example, €20 million was wasted on accommodation for asylum seekers which has never been used. Who authorised that? The Punchestown investment was rushed through in the Department of Finance with the Department's own guidelines bulldozed aside. There was no supervision of costs, which increased by more than 100% from the €6.9 million estimate to more than €14 million. It was a debacle.There has been a distinct inability to get to grips with big capital projects. For example, the cost of a kilometre of motorway has doubled from €5 million to €10 million in two years and the cost of the Luas light rail project has more than doubled to €770 million. The value for money ethos has never been spread around the Cabinet table, never mind around the Civil Service. It gives a new meaning to waste management – the Government's gross financial incompetence in respect of the taxpayer. Tax increases, particularly indirect taxes and charges, hit everybody. The increased cost of living has meant that the gains of the Celtic tiger for people on the average industrial wage have now been eaten up. Stealth taxes do not discriminate. Bus fare increases, bin charges and so on are a burden on everybody but they have a disproportionate impact on low and middle-income groups.The second item on which the Minister should have delivered was the reforms ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. Dealing with the issue of his failure on competitiveness, the National Competitiveness Council recommended a series of measures to promote entrepreneurship and enterprise development, stimulate innovation and creativity, support the enhancement of our skills base, improve our economic and technological infrastructure and relieve some of the administrative burdens associated with the business and work environment. I recognise that some small impact has been made in the area of business but it is not enough.On none of the fronts mentioned by the Government's own competitiveness council has this budget taken any strong action. With the swathe of new and hidden taxes and the increase in fuel costs and the wage pressure arising from this, our competitiveness will be damaged further. This budget has not addressed the council's principal recommendation, which was to achieve value for money across the board and eliminate the poor project management which has led to waste and delays. Disregard for taxpayers' money has become pervasive as the capacity to plan and anticipate costs has buckled in the rush to make a good announcement.What has been achieved? The scheme to provide medical cards for those over 70 was rushed through to provide a budget day announcement. The plan was out by 80% on the number of beneficiaries and 300% on the cost per person. A pension concession for pre-1953 contributors, pushed through as an item costing less than €10 million, is now running at 12.5 times its original cost. Five properties acquired in a panic reaction for asylum accommodation lie idle, at a cost of almost €20 million, because they could not be used. A 50% share-out of the cost of the Residential Institutions Redress Board with the congregations was frozen at €127 million. Meanwhile, the State's exposure has climbed from that figure to one close to €1 billion, while the State's legal officer was kept out of the loop.Expensive hospital facilities have been built but never opened in Mullingar, Blanchardstown and Birr. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has visited the community facility in Birr, but I was recently there. It was built with 90 bedrooms at a cost of almost €20 million, but it is lying empty, its patients occupying a 200 year old obsolete building further down the town. It cannot open because it needs €500,000 from the health budget to employ nurses. The same applies to Mullingar Hospital, which has been unfinished for the last seven years and, as the Taoiseach knows, there is a unit to open in Blanchardstown. This is only a sample of the many instances around the country in which lack of planning and strategy has resulted in expensive facilities being built but never opened.The Luas light rail system will provide less capacity than 100 buses and will cost three times the original estimate. The routes do not connect and the project has been interrupted and delayed by Government inactivity. Can anybody believe, with that record of incompetent financial management, that the affairs of the nation next year, with an expenditure of €41 billion, will be well managed? Does the budget give us any assurance that the reforms being put in place will ensure value for money? What innovation was evident in yesterday's budget to prevent cost overruns and bad management? Given the Government's appalling record, examples of which I have just mentioned, is there any evidence in yesterday's budget that next year will be any better?We heard the big announcement of the five year spending envelopes. We had this before under a Fianna Fáil programme of spending systems but it disappeared. Then we had the seven year envelope of the national development plan, which seems to have ended up in farcical non-implementation. We are now told that we will have financial envelopes with multi-annual planning for five years either to replace this national development plan or as an addition to it. When representatives of the Community Games, which does not have a permanent home in Mosney because of lease arrangements, met with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism three weeks ago he was not able to give any commitment beyond 2005 because, he said, the Department could not engage in multi-annual budgeting programmes. The new system has made a mockery of this. Every year 500,000 children participate in the Community Games. The Minister should meet the organisation again and include it in its multi-annual plans. The concept is a good one but it has not been followed through in terms of the national development plan. That is evident from the way projects have run over time and budget.The Minister for Finance referred yesterday to an increased concentration on public private partnerships. Page C31 of budget 2004 refers to a stealth tax which he did not mention, a €100 million charge every year for public private partnerships. This must result in tolls or charges of some kind.The Government's inability to manage public private partnerships is exemplified in the case of the Cork School of Music. The city has been chosen as the European city of culture for 2005, millions have been spent in architects' fees for the design of a building but, under the PPP system, this has not seen fruition. When it was raised in the House with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on a number of occasions, he said the blockage was due to the EUROSTAT office in Brussels, yet it appears nothing was done to sort this out. If there is to be a concentration on public private partnerships for the next five year envelope, we should have some evidence as to how this will be released by the Department of Finance and how these blockages, if they are in Brussels, are to be dealt with. The Government could borrow money more cheaply than it can be made available under public private partnerships. This needs to be addressed by the Minister for Finance.The third major objective of a budget should be the targeting of resources to where they are most needed. The Taoiseach referred to the measures taken in social welfare. We must care for the poor, the ill and our children. As was pointed out yesterday by Deputy Richard Bruton, the increase for children in the budget is 20 cent a day. The failure to increase medical card limits will result in thousands losing their medical cards. It will mean extra expense for these people in terms of school activities, medicines and medical treatment. There is nothing in the budget for the sick.More than 60,000 people will move from the 20% to the 42% rate of income tax. That is in addition to the 53,000 that went into the higher tax net last year. That is the major stealth tax in the budget. In the past two years, more than 100,000 people have been moved from the standard to the higher tax rate. A retired civil servant told me yesterday he now draws €38,000 on his pension and he will be taxed at the 42% rate when he receives the 4% benchmarking increase. Between that and the 21 cent on a gallon of petrol, he is left with little out of the budget. That is made worse for civil and public servants in the 42% tax bracket. While they will receive their increase, they will also have to pay PRSI and be taxed on the remainder at the rate of 42%. The increased benefit they receive on paper is removed by almost 50% taxation on that basis.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, said today that the €58 million in cutbacks in the Estimates for her Department have not yet been finalised and that she will listen to members of the Fianna Fáil Party. We know the Government listens to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party because 40 of them signed a petition the other day led by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, who I understand received a standing ovation at the first meeting but, along with a number of others, was severely denounced by the Taoiseach at the last meeting of the parliamentary party. The Taoiseach informed them that he would lead them out the gate, just as he led them in, but he used much more colourful terms.What is the Minister for Social and Family Affairs talking about? Is she talking about restoring the dietary allowance? Will she amend the child benefit allowance or reverse the 16 savage cuts she has introduced in her Department? What does this mean? She is now going to listen to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and make up her mind by the end of the year. We have had the Estimates from whence most of the pain has been inflicted, yesterday's budget did little to alleviate matters and she is now talking about reconsidering the issues raised by Members in the House. We understand she is now going to find out the truth from members of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party.It is worthwhile reflecting on the type of country in which we live. The following are the increases in 13 stealth charges introduced last year: VAT, 8%; motor tax, 12%; hospital charges, 26%; drug refund scheme, 31%; VHI, 18%; cigarettes and alcohol, 15%; bank and card charges, 108%; bin charges, 29%; ESB bills, 13%; college fees, 9%; parking fees, 25%; bus fares, 9%; and television licences, 40%.The Estimates in November of this year mean that the drugs payment threshold is raised by €8 to €78 per month, the accident and emergency charge is increased to €45 from €40, and there is a 15% increase in the cost of private beds in public hospitals and a €5 increase on the cost of an overnight stay to €45 per night with a cap of ten nights per year. The third level student registration fee is to increase by €80 to €750, the fee for the junior certificate examination by €10 to €82 and the leaving certificate examination fee by €10 to €86. Development levies of between €6,000 and €30,000 are likely to raise €700 million from first-time house buyers. That is the reality of what they face. The minimum contribution that all recipients of supplementary welfare allowances and rent and mortgage supplements are required to make towards their accommodation will be increased by €1 to €13 per week. The fee for a standard ten year passport has gone up to €75. Motor tax is up by 5% as per the Estimates when it had always been announced in the budget, previously. That is the reality of what people face.Despite the gloss put on the budget yesterday, the smiles will be wiped from the faces of Government Deputies when this reality begins to bite and local authorities have decided on and implement their charges. The fact the Minister for Finance allocated €30 million into the local authority fund without specifying what it is for begs the question as to whether it is a sop towards the recognition that local authorities can only raise their benchmarking requirements by shedding jobs, increasing charges, dropping services or by seriously increasing commercial rates. No explanation was given about this.The big diversion in the budget was the decentralisation announcement. Depending on one's point of view and what one supports, there are either few more exhilarating or nauseating scenes than the sight of Deputies clambering over Government benches to get out to be interviewed by the local radio station and say: "I did it. We are saved. I have delivered. Decentralisation is on the way."I support the decentralisation concept. One of the first major decentralisation initiatives took place in my town, Castlebar, during the years of the Cosgrave Government. Undoubtedly there are economic, social and regionalisation benefits from the decentralisation concept. I recognise that, but what is at stake here is the credibility of the plan announced by the Government: 53 towns in 25 counties to be completed inside a two year period. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said on the radio this morning that there would be no physical movement next year. If it is to be completed within three years, that means it will take place within a timescale of two further years.As Deputy Naughten has pointed out, Roscommon is an outstanding example of how a programme like this can be disrupted. Twelve years ago the announcement was made about decentralisation to Roscommon and it still has not happened. While I am sure the people there will welcome the announcement of 200 jobs, the credibility of the plan is at stake. Deputy Connaughton pointed out that, to get 100 jobs out of 10,000 for Ballinasloe when the Tánaiste made a major announcement about decentralisation and without any plan being in place after the Square D plant closed there some time ago leaves much to be desired.The credibility of the Government's decentralisation plan is at stake because only 2,183 of the proposed 10,000 decentralised jobs will be located in towns designated under the national spatial strategy. That means that the strategy announced with great fanfare in Kilmainham has been torn up. Even if all the pages have not been torn out, it has been seriously disregarded and cast aside.The scheme is to be implemented on a voluntary basis. I recognise that a great number of people from provincial Ireland work in Departments in Dublin. It may be that people from Gweedore, Kanturk or other locations would want to go back to their home place. While the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to be transferred to Wexford, it may not be possible for some staff to go to Wexford because of family ties, location or whatever. If the scheme is to be implemented on a voluntary basis, it may be that a relatively small number would want to locate in Wexford. This could give rise to the serious danger that this and other Departments relocating elsewhere could suffer the loss of experienced personnel.Will the Secretaries General of the eight Departments to move have to lead by example and live in these locations? Will Ministers lead by example and confine themselves to where their headquarters will be located? If, as the Taoiseach said last night, there have been consultations and discussions about the issue, where is the evidence of a planned strategy? The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said this morning that it is not a question of funding because it is available. Where is the money? If the Government cannot build schools, open hospitals or carry out even the smallest infrastructure projects, how can a plan to shift 10,300 public servants out of Dublin within two to three years have any credibility? While the announcement is welcome in principle, it amounts to nothing more than a diversion. The Taoiseach knows that in the run-up to the local elections, his party members are being hounded on the doorsteps because of the way people have been let down in respect of the delivery of services and the fact that the Government cannot be believed. He also knows that the central issue of trust in Government has dissipated.Following the announcement yesterday, evidence should be presented to the House on a monthly basis outlining the progress being made by the implementation committee. I have serious doubts about the Government's capacity to implement the programme. While a Cabinet sub-committee has been set up for a number of years to examine this issue, it must be borne in mind that it has taken three years to build a motorway in Kildare because of problems over a species of snail. Senior civil servants have a way of demonstrating that they constitute the permanent Government. Many Members on the Government benches will soon begin to understand that while this announcement may be deemed to be the panacea for all Fianna Fáil ills, not to mention the Progressive Democrats, the reality of implementing it will be much more difficult than envisaged.I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who appears to have the answer to everything, to explain to the House where is the money in his five year envelope for decentralisation? How will it operate on the basis of swapping sites and buildings? Does it mean that if a developer decides to provide public offices in Clonakilty, he will get in return part of the buildings in Marlborough Street currently occupied by the Department of Education and Science? What sort of arrangement is being put in place? Who will pay the development charges given that Departments do not pay rates to local authorities? A myriad of questions need to be answered. If secret consultations and discussions have been held over the past three years we deserve to know about them.Having said that, I do not want Members opposite to misconstrue our words. We recognise the value of decentralisation in principle, but we question the credibility of the plan for delivery. The announcement has been made before the Government takes up the EU Presidency when the Taoiseach and his ministerial colleagues will be very busy. The announcement has made done to encourage, comfort and provide some psychological succour to Fianna Fáil local election candidates who will canvass the country in the belief that they will be saved by the programme.What is the position regarding those towns that have not been chosen for decentralisation and, as a result, are very disappointed? What is being done with the health services and the IT sector, which make up a couple of thousand jobs? It is ironic that the Government is compensating for the abolition of the regional health boards to allow for centralisation of services in Dublin by making this major announcement on decentralisation. Given that the country ranks behind Peru in terms of broadband access, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must outline the capacity of the designated towns in terms of infrastructure capacity in such areas as water, sewerage, electricity, roads, broadband.When a radical announcement of this magnitude is made, the House must be informed about the back-up planning that has been made in terms of its feasibility. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, in particular will consistently come under the spotlight from this side of the House to see that he backs up his fine words with monthly progress reports and so on.Tax reliefs were referred to. Last year the Minister for Finance announced to great fanfare that they would be abolished. However, he has not done so, which is evidence of the lobbying power of some groups to ensure that they continue and that new reliefs are introduced. As I said on the Order of Business, a number of these reliefs will require notification to the EU Commission. I understand a number would be deemed to be state aid of one kind or another, therefore, they will require Commission approval. What evidence is there that the Commission will approve either the new tax reliefs or the continuance of the other reliefs?On public pensions, from next April anyone joining the Civil Service at the age of 17 will have to work for 47 years to qualify for a pension. Perhaps someone will explain how the pension payments will be calculated. At present, they are calculated on a 40/80ths basis in terms of years of service. Will that now be 47/96ths, or what will be the new criteria? Until now the Government has been trying to shed people from Departments, but this proposal will lock employees into a contract of service where they must work longer to qualify for a pension at 65 years of age. Does this mean there will be a change to the proportion of a pension a public servant can draw in the intervening period? Will there be a change to the proportion payable to them if they leave the service after 20 years or whatever? Does it mean that bright and healthy retired public servants who are over 65 can get back into the service because they left under a previous arrangement? What moneys are in the departmental public pensions account for next year and in the envelope for a number of years in the future? What are the implications for spouses and children under this new arrangement?I do not know if the announcement in respect of Members of the Oireachtas means that the Taoiseach will shuffle the group opposite because the Tánaiste is anxious to get out of her Department. It means that if he does this before April and appoints a couple of new people they will qualify, but if he leaves it until after April they must wait for many years to qualify.

From that perspective, the budget has not moved us forward to the point it could have. It has been clouded over by the smokescreen of decentralisation. There are serious questions to be asked and answered about the credibility of delivery. The feeble effort at looking after the disadvantaged and those on the margins leaves much to be desired. The reality of life on the streets is very different. The budget has not dealt with those faced with cost of living increases, the difficulties of normal everyday living and pressures on their time and income. Given all the money generated in recent years, I am struck by the social scandal that there is still evidence of women having to wait 18 months for an analysis of a lump on their breast to determine whether it is benign or malignant. One cannot appreciate the pressure, trauma and stress they must endure. Politics has failed to deliver access to a service in that sense. Fianna Fáil Ministers in particular appear to regard it as a badge of honour that they can spend billions of euro in their Department without any regard for the value for money it should deliver. The central thesis is that the Government should be in a position to deliver value for money for those it looks after.In the three central areas of dealing with competitiveness, targeting resources where they are needed most and the delivery of reforms to drive value for money, the Government has failed seriously. The Taoiseach can take it that, following the announcement by the Minister for Finance yesterday about these three areas, we will seek to pressurise the Government and demand answers from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, on how he proposes to deal with the decentralisation programme. I question his ability to deliver on a programme on which there is no evidence of consultations, discussions or the money available to him to do it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	159	By his actions in yesterday's budget, the Minister for Finance contributed to the explosion of one of the great myths created around the Government. It is now finally exposed as a high tax Government, only one that taxes under the cover of darkness. Like most of the budgets of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, there is a hidden time bomb in this one. It will explode when working people on modest incomes realise the extent to which they have been conned about income tax. Men and women who earn the average industrial income are liable to pay tax at the top or marginal rate of 42% just as if they were millionaires or super earners.For years the Government has paraded as the one that wants to give the people back their own money. The two political parties that put this budget together have had one mantra in common: they believe in getting Government off the backs of the people. They are, they say, committed to low tax, and enabling people to spend their own incomes. They have been speaking the truth only in one respect. Where the poor, vulnerable or isolated people are concerned, this is a Government that has abandoned them. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats believe in small government only in the areas where decent government ought to be involved.Where taxpayers are concerned, this is a Government that speaks with a forked tongue. It is a Government that taxes by stealth and, like a thief in the night, it has succeeded in moving a significant majority of those who pay tax onto the higher tax rate. That is despite the wide range of stealth charges introduced by the Government to try to create the impression that tax rates are low. My colleague, Deputy Burton. yesterday referred to what she called the greatest stealth tax of all perpetrated by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when he froze the standard rate band for the second year in a row, thereby at a stroke moving 71,000 taxpayers on modest incomes into the higher rate. The effect of this decision could bear a little more examination.There has been much publicity about the fact that a third of taxpayers now pay tax at the higher rate as a result of the budget. That third is to be set against the Government's stated objective of 20% of taxpayers paying at the top rate. This is a misleading and incomplete figure. There are approximately 1.8 million income earners in our economy. According to the Minister's figures, nearly 700,000 earn such a small income, they are tax exempt. Of the remainder who pay tax, 579,000 will now be on the standard rate, and 633,000 on the higher rate. In other words, a majority – 52% – of taxpayers will now pay tax at the higher rate. That rate of 42% will apply to the average industrial wage next year, just as it will apply to those with incomes of hundreds of thousands of euro, except that there is a cap for PRSI purposes on the lower or middle income person while there is no cap for those who earn hundreds of thousands of euro. It is important that people understand that, of those who pay tax as distinct from those who endure the serious problem of low pay and are exempt from tax on up to 90% of the minimum wage, something which shows the extent of low pay in the economy, 52% will pay tax at the top rate of 42%.The number on the higher rate of tax has increased steadily for the past four years while the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, preached about his commitment to a low tax economy. This is the first time, however, that his actions have resulted in a greater number paying at the higher rate than at the standard rate. In effect, the Minister is moving towards the creation of a standard rate of tax of 42%. The result is that thousands on moderate family incomes will be substantially worse off next year and will pay a much higher marginal rate of tax. That is before they begin to see the increases in rents, utility bills, education charges and other stealth taxes that this perfidious Government has in store for us.In one respect at least the Minister for Finance gave us great value for money yesterday. Perhaps for the first time ever we had two speeches wrapped into one: a speech that had nothing whatever to do with the annual budget and the budget itself. I acknowledge whoever it was who thought up the classic old-style Fianna Fáil stroke of announcing a detailed and comprehensive programme of decentralistion as an integral part of the budget speech.It allowed a gloss to be put on an occasion that would otherwise have been very glum for the Government backbenchers. They were waiting to find out if their courage and outrage in confronting their heartless Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues over community employment was about to be rewarded. It is interesting that not one Fianna Fáil backbencher has expressed the slightest concern for any of the victims of the €58 million social welfare cuts announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. The Taoiseach accused the Labour Party in his script of misleading the public about the €58 million in cuts. In doing so, I presume he includes the 13 organisations that have come forward with data that support the Labour position.Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Deputy Sexton, however, found no mention of community employment in yesterday's budget, nor any other meaningful aspect of community development. They were soon distracted by the coloured pictures accompanying the decentralisation announcement. As the Minister continued with his speech, revealing a complete absence of imagination, compassion, generosity and innovation in each of his social and economic utterances, the backbenchers were able to busy themselves with press releases to their local newspapers, ignoring the budget entirely and claiming credit for the great achievement of bringing a Department or office to their constituencies.In congratulating them, I hope it holds fine for them. The Government made many promises before the last election. I will not weary the House or depress Government backbenchers further by repeating them all here but there were supposed to be 200,000 medical cards, 2,000 gardaí, 12,000 child care places and an end to hospital waiting lists, and school after school was to be refurbished. Many of these promises, as we now know, had characteristics in common. They were detailed and specific, they were subject to timescales and they were all broken.On this occasion at least the Government has learned something. The programme of decentralisation announced yesterday is its first local election promise but this programme has no timescale, no detailed costings and no agreement with the unions involved. There is to be a committee, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn, that will report to a Cabinet sub-committee. Any property purchased in the new locations will have to be matched to property sold in the old locations. Negotiations will begin with staff but there will be no incentive to move and no recompense for costs incurred while moving. As Phil Flynn knows better than most, those negotiations, at least, should not take long.The truth is that a detailed and properly worked-out programme of decentralisation, capable of being implemented on a basis of agreement, would have many benefits, not only for the regions but also for Dublin. Indeed, proper decentralisation could be an exciting prospect, especially if the Government ever considered real decentralisation of power and authority as part of the package.It is impossible, however, to conclude anything other than that the package of decentralisation published yesterday will retain the status of a promise right up to, and through, the local elections. By now everyone in Ireland fully understands the status of a Fianna Fáil promise. It fits exactly into Sam Goldwyn's definition of a verbal contract, not being worth the paper it is written on.If the Government reneges on its decentralisation package, as it has reneged on so much else it has promised, it will simply drive another nail into its own already well studded coffin. Yesterday it was delighted that it had been able to use the promise of decentralisation to distract attention from a bad budget. After the details of the budget are forgotten, however, towns and communities throughout the country will remember that they have been promised an injection of new jobs and opportunities through this package, and the reckoning will be great if the Government fails to deliver.We know to date that the Government has broken other promises made for electoral purposes. We know that this decentralisation programme was announced in 1999 and at regular intervals since, especially during election year 2002. We know that next year is an election year, with local and European elections. We also know that the Civil Service has not been consulted and that civil servants are as surprised as the rest of us. The high-handed announcement for purposes of political expediency is the worst possible background against which to start negotiating with the Civil Service. The point has been made that yesterday's announcement disregards the Government's other big idea, the national spatial strategy, in favour of spreading the civil servants to mollify restive backbenchers. Everyone in this House knows that offering junior civil servants the entitlement to opt for transfer to provincial areas is one thing, but to promise the transfer of Departments lock, stock and barrel is another thing entirely. The Government will find that out. When Sir Humphrey agrees, the delay can be long, but when Sir Humphrey is aggrieved, and has not been consulted, the Government will find that its decentralisation plan, as announced, is no more than a mirage.As to the budget itself, the minor part of yesterday's speech in terms of presentation, what are we to say about it? The Minister's speech ran to less than 6,000 words, and just about half of them dealt with specific budgetary matters. Not one important new idea, not one idealistic initiative, not one significant reform, not one generous act, not one compassionate insight featured in the budget. This is a jaded and dishonest budget, from a jaded and dishonest Government. It is a formula for drift and stagnation, wrapped up in the language of fiscal conservatism. This budget is devoid of vision for the future of our economy and our society. It is equally devoid of compassion, reason and integrity.It is concerned only with the short-term needs of the privileged and the electoral needs of Fianna Fáil. The public purse is once again being prepared for use as Fianna Fáil's electoral war chest. Let there be no doubt the budget's key concern is not the good of the Irish economy, it is not more jobs or lower inflation and it is certainly not social progress, it is simply paving the way for another pre-election spending splurge, when the coffers will open once again and good news stories from the Government will be plentiful. Fianna Fáil Ministers will struggle to hide their smirks as, with pious faces, they tell us how they made the tough decisions in hard times, and now the good times have returned just in time for the general election.The Government has once again reneged on its promise to people working for low wages. The minimum wage is to be increased to €7 per hour next year but a large share of that increase is to be clawed back in taxation. What was provided yesterday was the bare minimum that it could hope to get away with in the context of partnership. There was nothing on the thresholds for medical cards, with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, saying on radio last night he had never heard of them, while the other Minister of State in the Department, Deputy Callely, thinks it is a matter for the chief executives of the health boards.That is the main story of this budget. Young people, working families and the low paid are being asked to pay more simply to fill the war chest for Fianna Fáil at the next election. There will be, however, no increase in the rate of capital gains tax so income from work will continue to be taxed at a higher rate than income from speculation. Once again, those who speculate in building land, and make vast fortunes by doing so, will remain untouched.I refer the House to last night's debate on the tax evasion financial resolution, Financial Resolution No. 2, which outlines the latest loophole exploited by developers and builders. The tax lost to the Exchequer may never be fully quantified but, over the past five or six years, it may have approached €1 billion. The Committee of Public Accounts and its Chairman, Deputy Perry, have had an interest in this for some time. The committee will probe this with the Revenue Commissioners Accounting Officer, Mr. Daly. Quite frankly, if the evasion has been even half that figure, prosecutions ought to be initiated against the worst offenders. It is absolutely obscene that at a time when builders and developers have made profits in excess of their wildest expectations, in a period of boom, they should have resorted to the exploitation of the loophole that was closed off last night. It is an absolute disgrace. Deputy Perry deserves credit for the role he played in causing it to be brought to the attention of those responsible.We have been subjected in this House in the debate to date on this budget, and in the debate on the Estimates, to a procession of Ministers repeating mantras from the Book of McCreevy: "You can only spend it when you have it"; "Managing the economy is a marathon, not a sprint" and "We do not believe in taking the short-termist populist route."  It is like listening to a masterclass in hypocrisy.We heard the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, lecture us on the need to keep spending growth in line with revenue growth. Even for him, this was breathtaking. Was this not the same Minister whose sole contribution to social welfare reform was to manipulate increases in child benefit to ensure that mothers received large lump sums only weeks before polling day? Was this not the same Government which increased spending at a rate in excess of 20% in the 18 months prior to the election? It has the neck to tell us that spending must grow in line with revenue. That is a latter day conversion. We will know that a general election is coming when that rhetoric is quietly dropped once again.A price is being paid for all of this. The pro-cyclical policies summed up by the mantra, "You can only spend it when you have it," are bad for growth, for jobs and for inflation. Stop-start economics is a bad deal for taxpayers, as any rational planning which might improve value for money is abandoned in a cycle of crude cuts and blunt-edged vote buying.This year we have a new commandment from the Minister for Finance. The Book of McCreevy says, "Thou shalt consolidate growth."  The Minister seems to think that we have reached the end of history. All Ireland needs to do is to consolidate what has been gained. The expected resurgence in the US economy will bring all good things to those who tighten their public finances. This approach is about as intelligent as telling a child who has climbed up a tree and cannot get down to sit on a leaf and wait for autumn.As a country, we cannot afford to assume that the model which worked well in the 1990s will simply kick back into gear once the United States picks up. That is to say nothing about the escalating euro against the dollar or today's move by Saudi Arabia to reduce oil production. The mismanagement of the economy by this Government has undermined our competitiveness too much. There are now fewer jobs in manufacturing, one of the key engines of growth in the 1990s, than when this Government came into office. The Government has failed to articulate, in any concrete terms, what its alternative model for economic development will be.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, realising that her ministry will no longer allow her to drive around the country making job announcements and taking credit not just for her own but for other people's achievements, has tired of it and seeks to depart. Her lack of interest in dealing with difficult times will come as no surprise to those who have suffered redundancy in the last year and looked to her for a response.Her colleague, the Minister for Finance, however, rambles on oblivious. He is unconcerned that our infrastructural deficit is now a major restraint on future non-inflationary growth in incomes and employment. He sees no difficulty in presiding over an economy which lacks the productive infrastructure commensurate with its level of development, and attaches no urgency to addressing the problem. He sees no role for himself, as Minister for Finance, to take responsibility for the future of the Irish economy, by taking responsibility for funding and managing the national development plan.It is fair to say that multi-annual budgets are a useful innovation, which should contribute to greater efficiency, and I welcome that. We have, however, long learnt to discount the content of press releases from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. We were wise to do so on this occasion as well. The billions of euro being promised for roads have, as expected, turned out to be simply the allocation for 2004, extrapolated to 2008, with some modest indexation. An annual average growth of 5.5% in Exchequer funding for roads might just about keep up with inflation. An annual average increase in Exchequer funding for public transport of 1.5% most certainly will not. Some of the difference is to be made up with PPPs but we have been promised much from PPPs before and seen no delivery.So too with education and the environment. Exchequer capital spending on education is to increase by 0.4% per annum and on environment by 1.8%. None of these will keep pace with inflation and the record of delivery on PPPs, even if they could produce a fair deal for the taxpayer, is pathetic. Only two years ago this Government was promising to spend 5% of GDP on capital spending. In 2004, it is €1,500 million behind on that commitment. There is no commitment in this budget to increase the spending level in real terms. Some roads will stay un-built and others will be slowed.Public transport will continue to be a mess. Traffic in this city will continue to defy human endurance. The regions will remain undeveloped. Pity the poor civil servants who elect to move to the regions, if they have to travel to Dublin regularly on business.It is interesting to note that we did not hear quite so much spin this time from the Minister for Health and Children. That is because Exchequer funding for health is set to increase by only 0.5% per year between now and 2008. We are left to wonder what has happened to the health strategy. What has happened to the €1,100 million or so in additional capital funding per annum for the health strategy that was promised at the last election? Where are all the extra beds to come from? How is the Hanly report to be implemented, or is the Minister for Defence acting authoritatively on behalf of the Government?Neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Government to which he dictates financial terms, is concerned about health, education, housing or crime. They are certainly not concerned enough to formulate policies and deliver the resources that go with them. It is one thing to devise a manifesto full of promises that they have no intention of delivering. It is quite another to formulate a coherent policy to see it through.At the last election, for example, Fianna Fáil promised an additional 2,000 gardaí. Anyone who failed to match that commitment was accused at that time of being soft on crime. Now we see that there are not 2,000 extra gardaí, nor will there be. Where is plan B? If 2,000 extra gardaí were needed but are not to be recruited, what is the Governments alternative strategy for tackling crime? How is it going to deliver better policing? How is it going to put in place a juvenile justice system which stops youngsters growing into gangsters? Where is the multi-faceted approach which stops gangland killings and does something for the children who live in those areas? The sum total of the Government's response in the criminal justice area is to cut funding for the probation and welfare service. Shaving a few pennies off a subhead is what passes for a strategic approach.The Minister for Health and Children, on the other hand, does not lack strategies. He produces them with the same industry that the Minister for Transport produces press releases. What Deputy Martin lacks is the ability to see any of them implemented. Where is the money in this budget to tackle hospital waiting lists? Where are the resources for the treatment purchase fund and what of the promise to deliver 200,000 extra medical cards? That was a clear commitment, one that is a mystery to Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. It was an easy promise to make, and it would be a comparatively straightforward one to deliver.Why is there no line in the Budget Statement which announces significant real improvements in the income thresholds for medical card qualification? The percentage of the population holding medical cards has fallen to an all-time low. The working poor will suffer as a result. Parents on modest and low incomes will face the decision as to whether they can afford to bring a sick child to the doctor. In the post-Celtic tiger era, despite all the growth and all the success, we still have parents who have to make that decision. It is shameful and wrong, and it is this Governments doing.The last decade has seen an economic transformation of an historic scale, which has placed our economy among the richest in the world. The Minister for Finances idea of consolidating that growth is an attack on the most vulnerable in our society, in the form of the "savage 16" social welfare cuts. He may have found it amusing to take advantage of the hapless Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The victims of these cuts find it hard to share the joke. For a mere €58 million, he has cut off avenues to employment in the back-to-education allowance, made it harder for lone parents to return to the labour force, condemned young people to homelessness, and sent others to treat with moneylenders. In his Victorian zeal, he has effected a substantial policy shift away from an active welfare system which eschews poverty traps, towards a new poor law mentality of sweating the poor. The only welfare which will not be touched is the equine welfare for tax exiles.When did the Minister last visit a school in a deprived area? There are schools in this city, only a few minutes walk from this House, where he can see real educational disadvantage if he cares to look. He will see children who live in chaotic homes and come to school with empty stomachs. He will also see the positive impact which school meals programmes have had on every aspect of school life. We know the Minister does not listen to argument, but he could try opening his eyes for once. This budget should have included provision for a new school meals programme, but it did not.

The subject bears examination, but in circumstances where some of these disadvantaged areas are already finding it very difficult to retain teachers, and given the critical importance of the quality of teachers in such areas, the new arrangements for retirement age might well have a very adverse effect on the same disadvantaged communities bearing the brunt of all the other cuts.This budget delivered the bare minimum of social welfare improvements. Any fewer, and even what passes for social partnership these days would have been doomed. There has never been a budget with less in it for children. Child benefit is to be increased by €6 per month. Where are the pre-election promises on child benefit? Fianna Fáil poured money into child benefit only weeks before the last general election, and promised that there was more to come. The child benefit rate for first and second children was meant to increase to €149 in 2003. Instead, in 2004 it will have reached €131.60. So much for the commitment to tackling child poverty or dealing with child care costs. There is nothing in this budget for child care. The cost of crèche places will continue to rise. Pre-school education will continue to be neglected.Similarly, there is nothing in this budget to tackle child poverty. Increasing child benefit is the best way to address child poverty, but failing that, child dependant allowances could have been increased. They remain untouched. A family living in poverty will get less than €1.50 per child per week. That is the measure of Fianna Fáil's commitment to the less well-off.Fianna Fáil has abandoned the less well-off in Irish society. Affluence is a wonderful thing. The new aristocracy in Fianna Fáil has abandoned the ordinary working family and the less well-off. They have made their bed with the nags and Jags brigade, and intend to lie there with them. There is now a new form of poor law being developed. For all the rhetoric about the best route out of poverty being a job, this budget will condemn thousands to remain on the welfare rolls, trapped in poverty. Community employment has been cut and the back to work allowance has been effectively dismantled. One has to be on the live register for so long now to qualify for that scheme that about the only people eligible will be Sinn Féin candidates.Last year, the Minister framed his budget around a highly conservative interpretation of the EU Stability and Growth Pact. This provided him with the opportunity to claim the necessity of underinvestment, or cuts in services, under the terms of the pact. At the ECOFIN meeting last week, however, he voted for the most liberal possible interpretation of the pact. He was prepared to see France and Germany run deficits in excess of 3% of GDP, yet he is not prepared to see Ireland, which has a more compelling case for increasing its borrowing level, invest properly in its future.The Minister claims that borrowing is deferred taxation. Underinvestment actually means deferred jobs, deferred sustainable growth and deferred social justice. The point is lost on the Minister that our capacity to service debt depends on growth in income. Borrowing to invest, provided that money is well spent, increases the productive capacity of the economy and our capacity to service that debt. It is growth over the last decade that in large measure lowered the debt-GNP ratio.When the national development plan was first launched, we were living through a period of record surpluses in the public finances. Even though those surpluses could never have lasted for ever, there was no substantive national debate on how the national development plan was to be funded. This Government decided that capital spending would be funded from current resources and effectively decided to reduce the quantum of resources available for day-to-day spending.However necessary our capital programme may be, it makes no sense to fund it entirely from day-to-day resources. The upgrade required in our economic infrastructure has a large once-off element to it. There are considerable demands for extra capital spending in the short-term, but those demands will ease once new infrastructure has been put in place, and the pay-off will come over a much longer duration. That is why it makes sense to borrow a significant proportion of the capital funding requirement. That is what the Labour Party has been saying for several years, and it is the view increasingly endorsed by commentators such as the ESRI.Instead of adopting this course, the Minister has chosen to cut capital spending and to squeeze current spending even harder. In his determination to further lower what is already the second lowest debt-income ratio in the EU, he is not only imposing unnecessary hardship, but undermining competitiveness.The ESRI has also repeatedly pointed out the merits of the approach used in the UK, where two fiscal rules are applied to public borrowing. These are the golden rules whereby borrowing over the economic cycle is limited to the amount of public investment, and an upper limit is put on the debt-income ratio. Adherence to these rules provides a transparent and stable fiscal framework while providing for adequate public investment.Rather than listen to the vacuous statements which the Minister of Finance and his fellow Ministers make about the era of massive deficits, I would like the Minister to tell us what level of debt-income ratio he considers to be high, and the level he considers low. I would like to know what his target debt-GNP ratio is for the remainder of the lifetime of this Dáil. That would at least provide a basis for a coherent discussion on the funding of capital spending.There is no reason Ireland could not adopt a borrowing approach similar to that in the UK, within the context of the Stability and Growth Pact or a reformed pact. Ireland should actively campaign for a new pact which would take account of the situation of countries with low debt ratios and major capital spending requirements. There is considerable acceptance of that situation in Europe already. Rather than turning a blind eye to breaches of the rules, it is vital that the rules should be reformed so that Europe has a credible and workable rules-based system.The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have spoken of the need to reform the pact, though for now they are not prepared to adopt anything other than the most conservative interpretation of it. Doubtless they will be content to see reform come in time for more grandiose promises to be made in advance of the next election.This is the budget of a Government which lacks the vision to invest in the Irish economy and people. It wants education on the cheap, so much so that increases in capitation grants are not included in the printed version of the Book of Estimates. Perhaps the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, balked at the prospect of another public humiliation at the hands of his colleagues. The Government speaks of building up capacity in the area of scientific research, but turns the funding tap on and off at a whim. It will not deliver on basic economic or social infrastructure. It wants our children to be educated in substandard schools, some in which the Government would certainly not house a horse.This Government is short-sighted and mean-spirited. It is rudderless, hanging onto power with no idea of where it wants to take the country. It will not even begin to fulfil the promises made to the electorate, since to do so would be to spend money earmarked for its next mindless pre-election spending splurge. The Government is worn out and clapped out. The "Punchestown Kid" has consolidated Ireland as a society of friends – friends of the Government. In the meantime, those on middle incomes will bear the brunt of the cost of running the services of the State, and the very poorest will suffer acute hardship because the paltry figure of €58 million must be pared off programmes targeted at the most needy in our society. This is not the way to run an economy and certainly not the way to run a society.

Since 1997 the Government has increased inequality in Irish society and widened the gap between rich and poor. In 1997 18% of people were living on incomes of less than half the average. The figure today is nearly 21%. After six years of unprecedented economic growth, that should have been reduced to a single figure. This is a budget of inequality which does absolutely nothing to narrow the gap between wealth and poverty maintained by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in every budget since 1997.The Government's national action plan against poverty and social exclusion states that nearly 25% of children, approximately 300,000, are living in poverty. Some 70,000 children are living in consistent poverty where there is real daily hardship such as the lack of a hot meal or proper clothing. That is obscene in a small country like ours where there is so much conspicuous wealth. This reality was denied by the Taoiseach in the days leading up to the budget and in the face of all the agencies which are working on a daily basis with marginalised communities. That denial of the reality of economic hardship for so many in our society was clearly manifest, once again, in the budget presented yesterday.The Government has broken its promises to deliver substantive increases in child benefit and old age pensions to levels that will meet the national anti-poverty strategy targets. An increase of less than €1.50 and €2 per child per week is an insult from a Government that has repeatedly claimed to be addressing child poverty. Increasing child benefit for the first and second child to €142 per month and to €176 per month for the third child and subsequent children would have cost an estimated €216 million. The totally unnecessary and gratuitous cut in corporation tax from 16% to 12.5% will cost the Exchequer €305 million this year, according to the Government's figures. The contrast in those positions speaks volumes about the thinking that dominates this right-wing coalition.The social welfare increases in the budget are totally inadequate and are undermined by stealth taxes such as local authority charges, the savage 16 cuts to welfare entitlements and the cuts in community employment schemes. It is disgraceful the Government did not use its increased revenue to reverse these cuts, especially the miserly and, I emphasise, dangerous rent allowance cut. The rent allowance cut is a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats catch-22 in that one cannot get rent allowance if one has not been in a flat for six months but one cannot afford to rent a flat if one does not have rent allowance.The social welfare increases have been undermined by inflation, stealth taxes, the savage 16 cuts which remain in place and the loss of community services provided with the help of community employment schemes. The budget was delivered on the very day when the Government voted against a Dáil motion to reverse those community employment cuts.The minimal tax measures in the budget have been presented as good news for the lower paid, but they are no such thing. The Minister has done nothing to reform, to target the highest earners or to tackle multi-millionaire tax exiles or tax evasion. There will be more people on the higher rate of PAYE after yesterday's budget. There are huge variations within that tax band, from workers on the average industrial wage to the top executives who awarded themselves wage increases last year in the order of 50%.Last year in our budget submission Sinn Féin asked the Minister for Finance to undertake a survey that would expose the minuscule tax take from the super-rich in Irish society. The Revenue Commissioners carried out the survey, as they had done in 1997, and the results for 2002 were just as damning. Of the top 400 earners surveyed, 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30%, in a system where more than 500,000 PAYE workers are paying the top 42% rate of income tax. Some 18% of the top earners were paying less than 15% tax and some, as has been repeatedly recorded in this House, were paying no tax.It is appalling that there are 20 tax relief schemes where the exact cost to the State of the lost tax revenue is not known. In many cases these schemes simply put money into the pockets of the wealthy such as the millionaire operators of the bloodstock industry. There is no proper assessment of the benefit to the economy of reliefs or an evaluation of whether direct State investment of funds in many cases would provide a better social and economic return. We are aware, however, of the benefit of section 481 relief for the film industry and I welcome its retention.Workers on average and below average incomes are being hit hardest by stealth taxes. For those taken out of the tax net with great fanfare yesterday, that benefit is wiped out by stealth taxes, including increased health charges, motor tax and fuel rises where they depend on or enjoy the use of a car.The budget has again spurned the 200,000 people who were promised inclusion in the general medical services scheme. Fianna Fáil's pre-election promise has come to nought. Is there any realisation at Cabinet of the dreadful choice faced daily by many families, struggling to make ends meet, when a child shows the first symptoms of illness, of whether to consult a GP? Many are choosing not to do so for the sole reason that they cannot afford to do so. Children's health, through no fault of their parents, is being placed at risk. The budget offers only silence to those families – silence on health.The budget is equally silent on housing. What is there in the budget for the 50,000 household units on local authority housing waiting lists, 85% of whom depend on an income of less than €15,000 per annum.An increase of €25 million in current expenditure in support of people with disabilities is to be provided in 2004. Of course, I welcome that increase, but much more was needed. This was presented, documented and pressed for time and again by people who deal with disabilities. The Government has failed in its financial commitment to the disability sector and particularly in its promised rights-based Disability Bill. It has failed to meet its commitment to increase disability allowance to the level of contributory old age pension and even to recognise a key requirement of people with disabilities, namely, a cost of disability payment scheme to help meet the many extra costs people with disabilities incur as a result of their disability. These people are still assessed on the basis of means rather than needs.The budget was an empty package wrapped in tinsel paper marked "decentralisation". Decentralisation is not a budget measure but something which has been promised by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, every year since 1999. While I welcome plans to move Departments out of Dublin having lobbied for a meaningful decentralisation programme since my election to the House in 1997, how long will it take to deliver these promises? There is no timescale for the programme, but it is obvious that the main period the Government has in mind is the run-up to the local elections of June 2004. When we will see delivery of the promised decentralisation programme is another question. The surprised reaction of trade union representatives is ominous. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers who believe they have been given this shiny present by Santa McCreevy would do well to think on how early the shine might rub off.Will the Minister and the Taoiseach explain why the decentralisation programme, which was announced yesterday and was piggybacked on the budget measures, was not married to the objectives of the Government's national spatial strategy? That question requires an answer. People are analysing the programme as announced and there are many questions about the choices made. I would appreciate a response from the Minister at the conclusion of this debate.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Yesterday's budget oozed cynicism from every paragraph and page. Much has been made of the decentralisation of public services. I do not wish to deal with that except to warn the good people in the regions and rural communities that this is one bog I suspect will be drained repeatedly in words over the next few years and that, in the end, most of the water will probably still be lodged in Dublin city.The budget was the most recent instalment in the programme of the Government which began with the publication of the Book of Estimates a few weeks ago and the provision therein for stealth taxes together with savage cuts in some key areas of expenditure. The budget and Estimates are a continuation of the policy adopted by the Government since first coming to power six and a half years ago, namely, to facilitate the transfer of wealth from working people and working class communities to speculators, bankers and big business.I noted how in his speech the Taoiseach was defensive about his Government being described as right-wing. He tried to defend it from that charge. Some of his learned advisers should inform him that one of the major criteria for judging the character of a Government, whether it is right, centre or left, is the manner in which it presides over the division of wealth in society. The truth is that no Government in the history of the State – and there have been some very right-wing Governments – has presided over such a shift of wealth from working people to the wealthy, capitalists and financiers.All one need do is study the housing market where the Government stood back and allowed an unrestrained orgy of speculation, profiteering and even racketeering by landowners, developers and financiers. The most basic human need for shelter was seen and allowed to be used as an opportunity to enrich them. In doing so, young people were enslaved to mortgage payments and all that goes with it for 20 or 30 years of their lives so that there could be a continuation of profits going to bankers, developers and speculators. At the same time the Government slashes the taxes on speculators by 50%, but there is not one iota of support in the budget for those attempting to buy a home for the first time.This is a Government that also endorses an ongoing weekly and monthly robbery of tenants by private landlords, many of whom are every bit as greedy as their landed counterparts in 19th century Ireland. Despite this, the Government yesterday raised a further €243 million in extra taxes on petrol and cigarettes, a burden which will mainly fall on ordinary working people, including those trapped in poverty.The reduction in corporation tax for big business in the last two budgets, which makes it the lowest in Europe, will hand back to the major corporations a massive €634 million every year from now on. The multinational corporations have been given a further concession in the budget as if they did not have enough profits already. It is a subject with which the media no longer deal. Last year the multinationals sent out of this country €15.25 billion in profits earned by the labour and the brains of Irish workers, and the figure for repatriated profits for the year before was €15.03 billion. Despite this, there is yet another concession to this sector.At the same time the Government has cruelly, deliberately and cold-bloodedly slashed €58 million in social welfare cuts from the hardest hit sections of the community. This is an incredible situation where landlords and developers have created a burning accommodation crisis and the Government hits their victims who cannot put a roof over their heads and will now be denied a roof if they cannot demonstrate that they have been six months in rented accommodation.The cuts in community employment schemes threaten to rip apart an important part of the social fabric of our community as services in the community for children, young people and the disabled come under pressure. The naive saw a slight flicker of hope that the community employment schemes might be safeguarded when the Fianna Fáil backbenchers began to roar like lions, but at one crack of the whip, the pride of lions was transformed into a scattering of whimpering mice with not even a bit of imitation cheese to show for their trouble.The people are subjected to cuts and stealth taxes while the prize millionaire stallions prance around their exercise yards on the plains of County Kildare. No doubt when their tax-free millionaire stud farm owners clatter over the Minister for Finance's mansion in their helicopters, they will tip their caps to this man who has yet again let them off the hook. However, a working class woman in west Dublin or anywhere else who drags herself from her bed in the dark on a winter morning to clean offices and other buildings to put bread on the table for her family is reckoned for every penny in taxation.A continuing scandal is that the millionaire and billionaire tax exiles are no doubt jetting off to their luxury hideaways in Bermuda, Monaco and other places this weekend—

I know the producers and actors involved would probably welcome the retention of tax relief for the film industry under section 481. Having said that, when I listened to the Taoiseach on the news last night, it was bizarre to hear him answer the charge that this is a cynical budget with the decoy of office relocation, designed with the local election campaign in mind. Moreover, it was priceless to hear him say that no matter how hard he were to try, he could not avoid elections if we were to have a democracy. It recalled the hassle of the multiseat constituency which annoyed his predecessor Mr. de Valera so much. However, the people rejected his referendum in that regard and I take it they will reject this Government, regardless of its platitudes.Even more bizarre is the lack of regard for the national spatial strategy, as demonstrated by the relocation of offices through decentralisation. One would expect the Government that introduced the strategy to strengthen it and give it some effect. However, rather than gateways and hubs being selected for the relocated offices – only 25% of the State jobs are going to gateways and hubs – other locations have been selected instead, thus creating a major headache for planners who are unable to say for definite whether the strategy will be followed. Furthermore, it represents a major headache for public transport companies trying to work according to the strategy's proposals on hubs and gateways. This is now thrown into chaos. It is also a headache for the education sector, which is not exactly sure of the location of the colleges that will be part of the strategy.Even if we accept that the Government has given up on the national spatial strategy, the logic of some of the relocations is particularly interesting and strange.

What makes Cavan the ideal location for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources? Is coastal erosion such a threat that Cavan is the cautious option for a coastal Department? Is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, being advised by some of the former councillors of Longford County Council who famously went on a junket to deal with coastal erosion? One has to wonder whether there is a logic to his decentralisation programme or whether it is pure, cynical political opportunism. To be brutally honest, all the indications to date suggest the budget is to give Government candidates a few Smarties to rattle in the next local election campaign.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	There is more to it than that. It is also to keep Bob the builder and the other Fianna Fáil fundraisers on board with carparks and other property tax allowance schemes. It will not trouble the high earners unduly as they can well afford the myriad of stealth taxes that are now so high as to be regressive. The widening gap between rich and poor bears that out.My colleague, Deputy Boyle, wisely observed how the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was pushing 68,000 workers into the top rate of tax. A worker on €28,000 and a high earning millionaire will effectively be on the same tax rate. Deputy Boyle described this as the Minister's revenge for benchmarking where he is not just penalising the modest income earner but using it to claw back locally generated revenue from local authorities. We know there is nothing in the budget for local authorities per se, however, they still have to pay benchmarking awards. To afford to pay benchmarking awards, as has been said, local authorities inevitably will have to increase commercial rates, housing levies and service charges to avoid having to work under even larger debts. Meanwhile, the Minister can sit back and smile as he collects higher tax returns from local authority payrolls after benchmarking.Fagin in Oliver Twist could not have devised a more cunning and thieving plan. Fagin generally robbed from the rich. The character behind the budget of 2004 is robbing local authority workers and their communities. By his actions the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is widening the gap between rich and poor, which is regressive. Income tax is supposed to be a progressive tax based on ability to pay and designed to redistribute wealth, but high levels of service charges are by their nature indiscriminate, save for the crude and haphazard waiver schemes.The Green Party sees a need for incentives to encourage conservation of resources and discourage waste. The plastic bag levy, which I proposed back in 1994, is a good example of that. The low charge of 15 cent per bag encourages use of reusable and durable alternative carrier bags. The Green Party will not support high, indiscriminate service charges brought in by a Government which is more intent on sustaining itself and widening the gap once again. The Green Party exists to bring about a sustainable economy, a healthy ecology and equality for all. The Government, by its actions, is working against these objectives.When one listens to the Taoiseach, one wonders if he is really in touch, He referred to the excellent train service on the Dublin-Belfast corridor. I wish he would travel on it, especially the northern suburban line. He would discover a two track rail system that was laid in 1844. In the budget there is a 3:1 bias in favour of capital investment in roads as against public transport projects.The Taoiseach tried to justify his position by quoting the directors of the IMF who commended the Irish authorities on their exemplary tax record. That clearly demonstrates that the Taoiseach is taking his line from an institution which is bent on using taxes to subsidise energy production to further long distance trade, which results ultimately in the breakdown of local and regional economies. This is a legacy of the Bretton Woods conference of 1944. After the Second World War the IMF, the World Bank and GATT declared an ongoing war on finite resources and biodiversity. In the previous century, 75% of agricultural diversity was lost as a direct result of the same policies for which the Taoiseach is signing up. He referred to the OECD endorsing his policies in principle, but the OECD expert, Mr. Yutaka Imai, referred to the need for real reform in the Irish system rather than the limited flexibility. Flexibility to the point of not being too rigid is one of the Taoiseach's characteristics.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Taoiseach boasts about the state of our public finances, including the Government debt and gross domestic product ratio. Unfortunately, as many of those who attended the World Summit last year would have told the Taoiseach, keeping an eye on the narrow range of economic indicators, such as inflation, Government debt and interest rates, is akin to flying an aeroplane without checking the fuel tank gauge. There are many indicators of a healthy economy, most of which are not to be found in the Minister for Finance's Book of Estimates or Budget Statement.The environmental challenge to the economy is an efficiency challenge – eco-efficiency. In every sector of the economy that means greater use of leaner, more intelligent technologies, such as the replacement of paper by information technology and new forms of energy. In short, the knowledge economy will be more environmentally sustainable. In global terms, the potential scale of the challenge is daunting. Some say we will need a tenfold improvement in resource efficiency by 2050.Every country has run up other forms of debt and danger. When the Taoiseach refers to "no borrowing", he misses the point. There is a huge ecological debt arising from our disproportionate claims on the world's resources and unsustainable use of the environment, including pollution. There is a huge carbon debt. The greatest responsibility is to address climate change and that must fall on those countries which benefit most from development and energy intense economic activity. The Government is placing a grave debt on future generations. Our children and grandchildren will not thank us for leaving them to pick up the ecological debt arising from our refusal to take action today. We effectively have scorched earth economics, of which the Minister for Finance is the champion.The global market for environmental goods and services is estimated at $335 billion, which is comparable with the world markets for either pharmaceuticals or aerospace, and is forecast to grow to $640 billion by 2010. That is the reason we must aim to be among the front runners in creating a green society, which we could if the Government had a real interest in that objective.The challenge of shifting to an intelligent, energy-efficient, low impact economy is one of opportunity. There is an opportunity, for example, to turn the national spatial strategy into a blueprint for development on a human scale with decisions taken where they are most sensitive to local, social, economic and ecological factors. There is an opportunity to pour investment into research and development to stimulate new clean technologies and clean production techniques for application at home and export abroad. There are opportunities to create new and meaningful employment in the green economy and to respond to new markets at home and abroad.Successful companies produce the goods and services that customers want and continuously improve them. Increasingly, customers want reassurance about the environmental impacts. The choice for business is stark. Environmental concern will not go away. Business must grasp the new agenda of sustainable development in its own interests. Many businesses of all sizes recognise the importance of being proactive and taking the lead. They enjoy both reputation and financial benefits as a result. The Government would do well to learn from them.It is ironic that the energy regulator, Mr. Tom Reeves, was on radio today stating that we must apply the brakes to renewable energy because we do not have the systems in place and the country is not ready for it. That is a small indication of the Government's failure to think through the direction it needs to take if there is to be a sustainable future. Having shown its hand in the budget, I urge the Government to examine what direction it and the country are taking rather than giving us the damp squib of the budget that suggests it does not care. This debate sends a message to Government that it must grasp the opportunities to build a sustainable economy, something which it has failed to do.

This means that the Government's coffers will find and give payments of over €11 billion to support our elderly, our children, those who have lost jobs and those who need our support. That is a lot of money. It represents a real commitment to caring and support. It will be the largest amount of money ever expended on social welfare payments in the history of the State.This Fianna Fáil Government is always accused of being this or that. We are accused of looking after sectoral interests.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	201	We are accused of looking after special interest groups. I agree we look after sectoral interests, and those sectoral interests I am proud to look after are those who are old, our children, those who are unemployed, the ill and those who need our support because they are disadvantaged. We look after those people. Their voices are disparate. Fianna Fáil in Government, in every ward and in every electoral area, through our network of councillors, Senators and Deputies, has its fingers on the pulse of this nation. We know that the vulnerable need our support and we give that support, and budget 2004 sets out in euro and cent our commitment.In budget 2004 I dismiss suggestions from misinformed critics that this is a right-wing Government. That comes from critics who have not done their maths. The critics are in baby infants class because if they looked at the financial figures, they would not put their hands up to curry favour with Ms media. They would not try to mislead her and mislead the public.In 2004 the social welfare spend will be approximately €11.2 billion. Perhaps we are all a little immune to large spending figures because in any other time that figure would be recognised for what it is, a historic announcement that a Government – in this case a Fianna Fáil-led Government – is spending €11.2 billion on social welfare. That is a national record.Within the total Government spend for 2004, that means €3 in every €10 spent will be allocated to social welfare funding. This money will go to an estimated 970,000 people who will claim a weekly social welfare payment next year. These funds will benefit approximately 1.5 million people, or about four out of every ten people in the State. Never before has a Government put so much emphasis on the agenda.I say to our critics, "Look at the figures."  We are looking after the country's biggest sectoral interests—

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	203	—-those who have no voice, those who need our support, those who each week draw vital social welfare benefits and those who have been sold short by the Opposition parties in the past, who see them as political playthings. I say this because the facts speak for themselves. The Opposition parties, when they had their hands on the purse strings of the central Exchequer, talked the talk but failed to deliver.The president of the Labour Party, who was formerly in my current post, decided to salute the achievement of the people who built this State and he gave them, in their twilight years, a derisory increase in their pension of £1.80. Let us remember that the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, sat in the high chair at the Cabinet table where he nodded approval of this slight to our older people.More recently, just after the last budget, I put a cap on the rate for rent supplements. The Labour Party again acted macho, trying to court Ms media, and dramatically insisted that people would be made homeless because of this reforming measure. Again, the facts deserve to be put on the record and equate with that party's non-participation in this debate, with no one on its benches. The Labour Party was wrong again. Rents were stabilised or reduced because it was clear that the social welfare system had helped to support rent increases, disadvantaging people seeking accommodation and put a burden on the public purse, and nobody was made homeless as a result.I ask those in baby infants on the Opposition benches, what else have they got wrong? What other claims will they get wrong and how can they be trusted to get it right?This year I again engaged in a number of reforms of the social welfare code. I have done this to ensure that schemes are best focused to those in need and to update schemes where other social welfare payments have made original scheme payments outmoded, and ensured that funds from taxpayers are spent on the alleviation of poverty and disadvantage and the provision of supports.Why have I done so? I have done it because the taxpayer is funding the social welfare payments system. The taxpayer deserves respect and value for money. I believe the taxpayer wants to ensure that the money is spent efficiently and if we are to tackle poverty, let us make sure every single cent is spent effectively. Let us make sure that for every euro, we get 100 cent worth of value.I say to the Opposition who has rallied against reform, do you want value for money or would you prefer that a pensioner is short-changed because the social welfare code needs reform? Would it prefer that someone goes uncared for because the social welfare code needs reform? Would it prefer that a child goes hungry because the social welfare system needs reform? What is its sense of social justice?The budget means that total social welfare expenditure will be €750 million more than last year, an increase of over 7%. An increase in spending of this magnitude demonstrates the Government is committed to protecting the less well-off in society at a time when economic circumstances have been far from their best. Through this time, the Government has taken tough decisions to ensure that we remain masters of our own destiny and that we are in a position to take advantage of a change in economic climate as it emerges to further our progress as an economy and a society.The Government has set in place prudent management targets in the public finances, and social welfare spending has not been immune from these, especially when some schemes like rent supplement have been growing inexorably and eating up more and more of the resources which should be put into people's basic standard of living.My Department continues to review its spending schemes and to ensure that their objectives remain valid and that positive outcomes are being achieved as efficiently and effectively as possible. No one should claim that all schemes should remain unchanged indefinitely. Reform should be constant and is vital. This is all the more important when we consider the vast amounts of money that we spend through the social welfare system –€11.2 billion.Let me address the rent supplement scheme. Rent supplements were never intended to meet a long-term housing need. The scheme is not a housing programme but, in practice, over the years has become such.

Furthermore, the rent supplement scheme does not give a good long-term outcome to the individual. There is limited security of tenure, accommodation standards can sometimes be poor and people must remain on social welfare to retain their accommodation. Neither does the scheme give a good outcome to the State as it provides poor long-term value for money and, in effect, bypasses the priorities set by local authorities in their housing programmes.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	207	This is why I have taken a number of initiatives in this area. Rent supplement will continue to be available to people with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk, such as people with disabilities, the elderly and those experiencing severe social problems. These measures will not affect people who are on local authority waiting lists, even if renting for less than six months; the homeless as defined by the local authority under the Housing Act; and tenants renting for six months and currently receiving rent supplement. Full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of people in implementing the new rent arrangements, with the involvement of the housing authorities.The crèche supplement was introduced with the intention of providing assistance to the parents of children in need of short-term emergency support. This can, for example, assist parents who would not otherwise be able to avail of particular supports such as counselling services or addiction treatment programmes. The fact that the supplements are in payment for long durations in many cases indicates that they have become long-term child care support rather than short-term social support for which they were intended. My Department is discussing this matter with the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that appropriate alternative measures are put in place to address the crèche needs concerned. I reiterate, no crèche will be closed as a result of this measure.Let me set out the Government objectives which underlie the budget package. These are to increase or maintain the value of all rates of payments in real terms; to continue to increase pensions in line with the programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to €200 by 2007; to make progress towards the NAPS target of €150 per week in 2002 terms of the lowest rates as indicated in the review of the NAPS and in the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress; to increase or maintain the real value of QAA rates of payment and to ensure that they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate; to provide real increases in income support for all families, especially for those in poverty, in such a way that it is not dependent on the parents' labour market status or income, through the implementation of a programme of increases in the level of child benefit; and to ensure that the return from even low-income employment for those with families remains positive through improvements in family income supplement.As in earlier years, most of the social welfare package is going towards increasing weekly payment rates to protect recipients against increases in the cost of living and to making progress on various Government targets. All increases in the social welfare adult personal weekly rates are well ahead of the rate of inflation which is expected to average at 2.5% in 2004. The increases range from 6% to 8% and in the case of the lowest social welfare payments are more than three times the rate of inflation.We have increased the main pension rate by €10 as we make further progress to our target; the rate for a pensioner couple will increase by €17.70 per week; the pension rate for widows and widowers over 66 years of age will increase by €11.50 to bring it into line with the main rate for pensioners. We have also increased the qualified adult rate for those on invalidity pension by €16.10 per week. All other rates have increased by €10 – considerably above the projected rate of inflation – and €16.60 for a couple. This brings the lowest social welfare rate up to €134.80 which constitutes very solid progress towards our 2007 target.The increase in the lowest rate of social welfare payment is a highly significant process in combating poverty but also in reforming special add-ons which have been introduced to the social welfare system from time to time. For instance, as part of the Estimates process, I announced that the diet supplement scheme is to be restructured to take account of changes in the level of social welfare payments generally. The current basis for calculating the amount of supplement payable in individual cases was put in place in 1996. Since then the cost of diets has not been updated, the assessment of means has not been changed and effectively the amounts paid have not changed.Since 1996 increases in social welfare payments have ranged from 57% to 71% for the majority of persons in receipt of diet supplement, while the cost of food, according to the consumer price index, has risen by 28%. Consequently, the gap the diet supplement was intended to address has narrowed over time. In future, diet supplements will be based on the current cost of special diets, the current income of claimants and the premise that one should not have to spend more than one-third of income towards food costs.All current recipients of diet supplement will continue to receive the amount paid until such time as a change in their circumstances warrants a review.

The Government has signalled that it wants to put a renewed focus on the ways and means of tackling child poverty. Its preferred approach has been to increase the universally paid child benefit rather than target additional resources at families on social welfare through child dependant additions. Child benefit payments have a number of advantages as a targeted approach.For some mothers, child benefit represents a recognition of their work in the home. Child benefit provides additional resources to families with larger numbers of children who are, research shows, at risk of child poverty. Child benefit is not withdrawn as a person moves into employment or increases their earnings. In line with this approach we are increasing the rate of child benefit by €6 for the first two children and €8 for third and subsequent children. This will bring total expenditure on child benefit to a truly staggering €1.78 billion euro in a full year or an average of almost €1,680 for each child per year.

It now targets areas of disadvantage or children with special needs. Having doubled funding last year, I am pleased to announce a further expansion to this scheme with an extra €1 million provided in 2004 which will benefit an additional 3,000 children.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	In announcing the Abridged Estimates for next year, I stated that the half-rate transitional payment for lone parents was to be discontinued and that in future the main support for lone parents on low incomes would be the family income supplement as currently applies to many lone parents and other low income families. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this was one of the main recommendations of a recent report by experts in the OECD which suggested that family income supplement could be better promoted as a tool for providing financial incentives for lone parents to enter employment. To this end, I have increased all FIS earnings thresholds by €28, resulting in the average family payment increasing by €16.80.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Some media comment suggested that resources for FIS payments had been reduced in the Estimates process. This is incorrect as I had already provided for some additional places on the scheme as part of the Estimates. I am also using part of the social welfare budget package to put additional resources of more than €10 million into FIS and I will be addressing the need to improve the take up of FIS among lone parents on low incomes.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	One of the more reasonable comments made about the recently announced changes to rent supplement was that the operation of the benefit and privilege calculation in terms of unemployment assistance penalised some unemployed persons who were still living in the family home. This is due to the assessment of the value of board and lodgings being included in the calculation of entitlement.Last year, I started to make progress on one of the last remaining recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare by abolishing this assessment for persons aged 29 and over. I am pleased to make further progress so that it will be abolished for persons aged 27 and 28 years and by increasing the minimum unemployment assistance payment where means are derived from parental income from just under €32 to €40 where there is an underlying entitlement to payment.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The independent estimates review committee appointed by the Government last year to consider spending proposals from each Government department recommended that the back to work scheme be abolished in view of the fall in unemployment. I am acutely aware that while there is a need to refocus the programme, it remains a useful scheme and, for many, has provided a pathway out of dependence on social welfare benefits.Accordingly, the Government accepted my recommendation that we should not abolish the scheme in its entirety but rather refocus it on those most in need of labour market intervention. This included the very long-term unemployed or those on the live register for five years or more. This measure has allowed my Department to target the scheme at those groups and there has been considerable interest in the scheme from them in the past year.I am aware that the needs of persons moving into self-employment require earlier identification and intervention. My Department's experience has been that BTWEA is essential if people are to progress from unemployment to starting in business. I am pleased to announce that persons on the live register for three years or more will in future be eligible for the back to work enterprise allowance. This proposal is in line with the recommendation of the INDECON report to decouple the self-employed and employee aspect of the scheme. I am also increasing the level of resources made available in employment supports such as the special projects fund and technical assistance and training fund.So much is happening in my Department that I could speak about it for a lifetime.

It is a reflection of the ethos of the Government to oversee the largest increases in social welfare payments despite the economic restraints. I welcome the opportunity to outline our support for those less well-off.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Minister is lucky to have a good Opposition which pressured her to change the position on the rent supplement.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I wish to continue on the theme developed by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. The Government has been criticised by the Fine Gael and Labour parties in regard to the child benefit rates. They have forgotten their own pathetic record of increases as low as £1—
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Minister should get back to reality.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	—or just €1.72 per month. The Opposition parties have criticised us because the increase only amounts to €1.50 per child per week but they have forgotten their own record. Under the rainbow Government, in which the Fine Gael and Labour parties participated, the benefit increases amounted to €0.31 per week per child. They criticise the Government because child benefit increases amount to €0.21 per child per day but they have again forgotten their own record, when benefit increases amounted to €0.04 per child per day, less than half a cent—
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	253	What was the rate of inflation then?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	254	—an amount so paltry there is not even a coin in existence to represent it. There is a stark contrast between the 30% rise in child benefit under the rainbow Government compared with the more than 300% rise under Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1997.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	255	What about Nenagh hospital?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	256	People cannot even get access to an accident and emergency ward.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	257	To appreciate the scale of child benefit increases under Fianna Fáil, when we returned to Government in June 1997, child benefit was payable at the rate of €38.09 per month for the first and second child and €49.52 for the third and subsequent children. The increase in the priority attached to child benefit by Fianna Fáil-led Governments means that following the 2004 budget, child benefit will now be payable at the rate of €131.60 for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. This means that the rate of child benefit payment has increased by 350% since we took over from the rainbow Government. Given this, I do not want any more crocodile tears from anyone about these benefits because the record stands for itself.Along with the Estimates, the annual budget sets out a framework of how the Government intends to steer the economy in the year ahead. This budget is the seventh consecutive such framework presented to the people by the Government and its predecessor. Like the six previous budgets, it sets out a strategic set of spending and policy initiatives which are intended to keep the economy close to the top of the EU league of performers. Good government is about having a vision and showing a willingness to make tough decisions based on the necessities of fulfilling it.Since 1997, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has followed a vision and taken the decisions which were often tough but which have made the country a better place in which to live. We know that more remains to be done and we have some way to go before we are fully satisfied that we have taken all the people with us. The budget, and the overall strategy of the Government, is designed to ensure that we maintain the prosperity we have built over the last six years. We must ensure that Ireland, having passed through the enormous acceleration in growth of recent years, holds the gains we have made and does not go back to the situation prior to the Celtic tiger economy. We will achieve this if we remain competitive. The budget will ensure this.The Opposition, which still clings to the notion that it was the architect of the prosperity enjoyed in recent years, will no doubt try to blow holes in the budget. That is its job, but this time it does it with less conviction than before. The House adjourned early last night, which is a good sign that a budget has been well received. The Deputies on our side wanted to go home with the good news, while the Opposition Deputies wanted to head to the bar to get over their sorrows—

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The budget builds on its six predecessors and lays out a strategy that will continue to keep inflation down, sustain competitiveness, maintain quality employment and address social inclusion. The Opposition will claim to have an alternative vision and a set of alternative priorities for the country, but if recent form were to be followed this would mean a return to the policies of punitive taxation, massive borrowing and permanent deficits. The last time the country saw a full term of a Fine Gael and Labour Government in the 1980s, the borrow and bust philosophy resulted in mass unemployment, mass emigration and underfunded public services.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Does the Minister remember 1977?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	261	No wonder the Deputies opposite squirm uncomfortably when reminded of this appalling legacy of despair and desolation that marked their budgetary strategy of the 1980s. To quote the Minister for Finance yesterday, "borrowing is the real stealth tax."  The Opposition would no doubt lead us down this path again and back to a time when the IMF was about to pull down the shutters on the country. Massive borrowing and crippling taxation drove away investment and sent our people in their thousands to the dole queues or out of the country.The budget holds tax at its historically low level while keeping borrowing to a minimum. Due to the sound stewardship of the last 12 months the economy has ridden the waves of the international downturn relatively unscathed. The Exchequer will borrow €2.8 billion next year, a comparatively modest sum that will maintain the debt to GDP ratio at 33%, the second lowest in the EU.Although our budgetary approach is prudent and we are prioritising spending in the areas of most need – education, health, social welfare and infrastructure – Government spending is still at an all time high. We are containing the rate of increase to more realistic levels but, nonetheless, spending will amount to €42 billion next year, an increase of almost 7% and well ahead of inflation at 2.5%.We are tailoring our spending to match the more modest growth of the economy but the key and fundamental point is that we are still moving forward and, in doing so, firmly controlling public spending and keeping taxes low. Having already reduced personal tax rates by 12% since 1997, the budget provides for €300 million in tax reductions next year. It means that over the past six years, the Government will have given back €5 billion of taxpayers' money to ordinary workers. Ireland is now recognised as having the lowest level of personal taxation in Europe.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	263	If ten years ago it was asked if this could be achieved the answer would have been "no", but it has. Mindful of our commitments to promote social inclusion, the income tax burden for the lower paid in particular will reduce further through increases in the employee tax credit by €240, to €1,040. This will sustain the position whereby tax is not payable on 90% of the minimum wage, already the highest in Europe, and introduced by this Government. Some 36% of people working in this country pay no tax, 31% pay only at the standard rate and 33% pay at the higher rate. We said we would have two thirds of all taxpayers out of the higher tax band. The Opposition would love to have that record—

Over three budgets it removed a mere 38,000 people from the tax net. We have managed in one year to lift more people out of the clutches of the tax system than the rainbow Government did over three.

Much has been peddled recently about social welfare cutbacks. The budget nails this as a lie, as the package unveiled, along with the recent Estimates, is the largest ever in our history. An additional €730 million will be spent next year on social welfare, a massive increase bringing, as the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has indicated, the total spend to over €11.2 billion in 2004.This will allow substantial increases across all areas well above the rate of inflation. Personal rates of disability/unemployment benefit will increase by €10, family income supplement goes up by €7 and income thresholds rise by €28 per week while the respite care grant rises to €835 per year. This did not even exist when the Opposition parties were last in Government—

We have dramatically increased the old age pension since we came to power to 1997. We are now committed to increasing this to over €200 per week during this term of office and the budget shows that we are well on course to achieving this. An increase of €l0 per week lifts the old age contributory pension to €167.30 per week, the highest ever. Nothing illustrates the hypocrisy—

It is great to see the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, try to defend the social welfare cuts. Credit is due to her for attempting to defend the indefensible. A special mention is due to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith. There was no reference to defence in the script he circulated other than in the title. That is how much he thinks of defence and resources for the Defence Forces, even when they are on their way to participate in a foreign mission. He also did not refer to Nenagh Hospital. There is little point discussing increases in child benefit when the children in the Minister's constituency will have to travel 50 to 60 miles to access an accident and emergency facility. The Minister did not utter a word about it.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	In fairness, I welcome the decentralisation announcement. However, it is only a fig leaf for the daylight robbery being conducted by the budget. One of the headlines in today's national newspapers uses the word "pickpocket", which is an apt description of the budget.In 2000, the Minister for Finance announced during the Budget Statement that that there would be a surplus of €6 billion over the following three years. We are now facing a €9.5 billion deficit – so much for prudent management of the economy. The standard tax rate has effectively been increased from 20% to 25% as a result of stealth taxes and charges introduced in the last two budgets. The Minister for Defence claims we have the lowest rate of personal taxation, but when one considers the stealth taxes, there is nothing extraordinary about it. Stealth taxes will hit the average household with a bill of approximately €600 this year. This is on top of an estimated bill of €1,200 imposed on households last year. That is a total of €1,800 over a period of 12 months. It is the equivalent of a 5% increase in the personal tax rate.The Government congratulates itself on the number of people who are inside and outside the tax net. However, more taxpayers pay the higher rate of tax today than at any time in the past 20 years. The programme for Government promised that only 20% of all taxpayers would pay the higher rate of tax but, from 1 January next, just more than one third of taxpayers will pay tax at the higher rate. An additional 62,000 people will go into the higher tax bracket and, for the first time, people on the average industrial wage will also be affected.The €6 per month increase in child benefit is pathetic. It is 20 cent per day. There is a crisis in both the availability and cost of child care, but the Government's response is a 20 cent per day increase in child benefit. We have also seen the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, up and down to the plinth like a yo-yo over the past fortnight to discuss the community employment schemes. There is not a word about them in the budget. There are no extra places on the schemes and the cutbacks announced earlier in the year are being implemented.Transportation will bear the brunt of stealth taxes. This budget will cost the motorist an additional €125. This includes duty, excise, VRT and motor tax. Up to €4 billion of Exchequer returns are funded by the motorist. That is nearly 10% of the total outlay by the Government in the budget announced yesterday. Motor tax has increased by 17% in 13 months. The cost of a litre of fuel has been increased by 5 cent while the cost of parking has increased by 25% in the past 12 months. People do not have the choice of using public transport. Generally it is not available and, where it is, the service is inadequate. Now the Minister for Transport has approved a further increase in the cost of public transport, an increase of 13% in 12 months. That is far in excess of the rate of inflation. The Minister for Finance spoke about inflation proofing but the Government is piling on the stealth taxes. The increase it approved in the cost of public transport is to cover the €100 million loan the Minister for Transport approved for CIE.The stealth taxes announced by the Minister and provided for in the budget will increase the inflation rate and the cost of living. The Minister for Finance claims the increase will only be 0.4%, but experience shows that it will be much higher. This morning National Toll Roads increased its toll charges on both the East Link and West Link bridges by 15%, a full 12.3% above the current rate of inflation. These pricing structures were agreed with the Minister for Transport. The increase will have a significant impact on motorists.Higher transport charges will increase the cost of imports and exports. The cost of exports will threaten employment in this country while the cost of imports will increase the inflation rate. That will eat into any increases obtained in the next round of negotiations on a partnership agreement and on benchmarking, as well as the paltry social welfare increases referred to by Ministers. Transport charges increase business costs and put pressure on our competitiveness. The majority of foodstuffs in this country are imported. If there are additional transportation costs and taxes, there will be a direct impact on the cost of food and the cost of living as well as on the cost of exports, which will make the country less competitive and lead to further job losses.Yesterday, the Minister for Finance sneaked in an announcement that an additional €150 million in tolls will be collected from 2005. This will put further pressure on transport costs. In the next couple of years, if somebody wishes to transport goods from Cork or Limerick to Larne or Scotland, there will be five separate additional toll charges to pay. That is an additional tax on employment in the regions. The Tánaiste talks about attracting investment to the regions, but the additional €300 million that will be obtained in user charges will impose direct taxes on the cost of employment outside Dublin. The only alternative is to provide a decent road structure but that is not happening.We have a Third World standard of road transportation while the rail network is a joke. The Minister for Transport is winding down the rail freight service. We have a crazy situation whereby the rail freight service to the west is being closed down and, in addition, the Athlone depot is being closed. Trains will go through Athlone fully laden and then on to Claremorris to deposit their freight. A lorry will then be sent from Athlone to Claremorris to be loaded up before returning to Athlone for distribution. Similarly, heavy goods vehicles will come from Galway to Claremorris to load up before returning to Galway for the goods to be distributed there. This farcical situation highlights the fact that the Government has no transportation policy.The Minister is talking about an overhaul of the construction system but we need a real overhaul involving tendering, planning, project management and financial accountability. The Minister will have to take a proactive approach to this matter. The Minister for Transport cannot sort out the problem facing heavy goods vehicles because the Dublin Port tunnel is not high enough but what can we expect from a Minister who produced candles that could not fit through letterboxes?A sum of €20 million for decentralisation was announced in the budget but that would not even cover the cost of furniture removals for many Departments in Dublin. Sadly, decentralisation is a cynical promise to help many Fianna Fáil candidates to face the wrath of the electorate on the doorsteps. They cannot fix the schools or hospitals and cannot recruit extra gardaí. We have seen no timetable for decentralisation and no budget for its implementation. I am calling on the Government to publish immediately the dates for the roll-out of decentralisation. In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance spoke about staff being transferred on a voluntary basis, which will be the opt out clause for the Government not to proceed with the decentralisation programme.I welcome the plan to transfer 230 civil servants to Roscommon town. We have the serviced land and a public private partnership is not a problem. The broadband technology is available and we also have the sports, recreational and social infrastructure. A substantial amount of land has been zoned for residential use so there is no excuse for the Government not to proceed with it. It is not a matter of civil servants not wanting to transfer to Roscommon, because 197 of them are already on the transfer application list for the 25 positions in the General Registry Office in Roscommon town. The applicants include an array of civil servants from the top to the lower grades. The plan to decentralise the General Registry Office to Roscommon town was announced 12 years ago but it has not yet happened. Some 553 applications have been made by civil servants to transfer to County Roscommon so surely the Government can facilitate decentralisation to west Roscommon and Boyle.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the opportunity to comment on this financial resolution and the budget in general. I am glad the Tánaiste is in the House because this debate is very relevant to her Department. Monaghan town has received 25 new jobs through decentralisation so I make no apologies for having stated yesterday that the Government has ignored the problems facing the town. It is relevant that the jobs are being provided to combat poverty but over 500 jobs have been lost in the area in recent years, including Monaghan Poultry, Patton's Mills, St. Patrick's College and McCaldin's Bakery. The textile, mushroom and furniture industries are on their knees. The only additional jobs that came to Monaghan were during the period of the rainbow Government when the EU office dealing with cross-Border structures was opened. Thankfully, there are now approximately 30 jobs in that EU office along with some others in the office that replaced the customs post. Monaghan has been one of the areas hardest hit by the Northern Ireland troubles.I welcome the 85 jobs for Carrickmacross as well as the 425 that are being provided for Cavan town. I acknowledge that when good work has been done people are entitled to recognition for it. One of the oddest decisions, however, was the political one to decentralise tourism affairs to Killarney, which is like bringing coal to Newcastle. Tourism is now handled on an all-Ireland basis so it would have been obvious to decentralise that office to County Monaghan, which reaches into the centre of Ulster. It is hard to understand the decision and it seems that when it comes to the Northern Ireland peace process, the Government talks the talk but does not walk the walk. It is a major problem.Some 1,500 jobs destined for transfer have not yet been decided upon but I am glad to see that the architect of decentralisation, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is present in the House for this debate. He should examine carefully where those jobs will be located. Some of them are in the IT sector, which means that broadband facilities will be required in the Border area, but they are also in health and other sectors. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State should consider transferring such jobs to Monaghan, Castleblayney, Ballybay, Clones, Cootehill, Belturbet and other Border towns that have been hit severely as a result of the Troubles.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I welcome the multiannual capital allocation for infrastructure but I cannot find any hope in the announcement that the €644 million underspent in the BMW area will be rectified. Such important infrastructure is urgently required. Recently, together with Deputy Richard Bruton, I visited a number of small factories and the two major issues that arose were insurance costs and the fact that they could not communicate with customers abroad due to the lack of broadband. One such factory was located on a main road but Eircom had left wires lying on the road for six months. When lorries parked on the wires, phones in the factory did not work properly. Those are some of the difficulties that are being experienced in the area.Ireland has now even fallen behind Peru in the broadband rankings. We are ranked 15 out of 16 for infrastructure, 11 for IT facilities, 12 for research and 15 for prices. Ireland is now the joint most expensive country in Europe.If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, can obtain agreement on multiannual funding for the infrastructural programme, it is difficult to understand how, seemingly, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs cannot obtain multiannual funding for public private partnerships that have been sought for a long time. Such partnerships would provide planning structures to provide for people in poorer areas of the country.In addition to infrastructure, we also need to be competitive but the budget has done nothing for the low paid. It has increased costs relating to motor vehicles. A 22.5 cent increase on a gallon of diesel or petrol, together with the cost of insurance, will have a negative effect on competitiveness in areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal where there are no railways.While I welcome the €30 million towards a one-off payment for local authorities, it is clear that this is just an aid to get them over an election year.The budget has not given any hope to the families of the 65 or 70 people who are on a subvention scheme waiting list. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State might not realise it but between 65 and 70 of our oldest and handicapped people are on a waiting list for subvention to get into a nursing home and the Government cannot even come up with that money. We hear all about the billions of euro the Government is spending, yet those who worked hard for this country and who are now on their death-bed are being ignored. That is a fact I can stand over beyond yea or nea. A 99 year old is on a waiting list for subvention in the Cavan-Monaghan area. That is proof that the Government ignores the problems of the Border region. Before the last election 230 people in Cavan-Monaghan benefited from the subvention scheme but under the new order only 156 can benefit, representing a cut of one third.Up to 100,000 people lost their medical cards over the past two years. Before the last election we were promised 200,000 extra medical cards and 80,000 were extended to those over the age of 70. This is serious for those who are not well off, not only from a medical point of view, but if they are living in rural Ireland they also have to pay for school buses and other charges they would not have to pay if they had a medical card.A health centre in Cootehill is another example of the lack of care for the elderly. The medical part of the centre was opened by a Minister before the last election but the area which would have dealt with the aged and the handicapped remains unopened, although a Minister came down the other day and tried to get the volunteers to run it for him. That is totally unacceptable.I welcome the increase in social welfare which is needed to cover increased costs. In areas like those I have mentioned there are additional expenses for the elderly in that they must have a car or some other means of transport. There are no bus services and therefore using a free pass is not an option so it is necessary for them to have that increase.I want to turn briefly to the farming scene, and I am glad that there are some people in the Chamber who understand farming – at least they claimed they did for many years.

There is no doubt about that. We got €3.2 million in terms of increased VAT but it came a year late. There was no change in VAT for this sector in yesterday's budget. There was no reason to change it other than that it was recognised that it should have been changed a year ago. One could say that is €3.2 million lost to farmers.Disease levies were doubled last year. We were advised that it would be brought back into line this year but one quarter of it was taken off this year. The €5 million is useful, however. It is going in the right direction but it does not support the income situation in farming.

That is a major issue. Most farmers transfer their farm at some stage to their sons or daughters but under the current structures, farmers are more hesitant to hand over their farms at an earlier age because of marriage difficulties and so on. That is a fact regardless of whether we like it. A farmer's son, nephew or anybody else must have the same right to lease the farm and benefit from that. To that end, I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food to clarify the position regarding milk restructuring as quickly as possible. If farming is to survive, those issues need to be addressed. I also welcome the extension in grant structures because with the delay in farm building allocations, and all the red tape involved in that, very little money has been drawn down.On the farm assist scheme, one outcome of the march to Dublin by 40,000 people was that 20,000 were guaranteed places on the scheme but the figure never passed 8,000. We now find there is an attempt to abolish the scheme.

At least the Minister for Social and Family Affairs rectified to some degree the back to work scheme but the Minister has left the farmers he represented for so long on a hook as far as the roll-over tax is concerned and the damage it has done to anybody dealing with the situation.

The Minister for Finance had a golden opportunity to do a good deal for everybody but he ended up doing nothing for anybody. However, I welcome the decentralisation programme announced in yesterday's budget which is long overdue. It was in 1999 that the Government first announced plans to decentralise 10,000 civil servants. That was over four years ago. The Department of Finance said earlier this year that it could take up to ten or more years to complete this programme, yet on a radio programme this morning the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, waved his magic wand and said that it could all be done within two years.I support the contribution of my party leader, Deputy Kenny, to the debate this morning when he called on the Taoiseach to give a progress report to the Dáil every three months on the decentralisation programme. First, an implementation committee will be set up to drive the process forward further, another committee representative of the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works will be established in the area for which the Minister, Deputy Parlon, is responsible—
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	311	It is running already.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	312	—and each Minister will have a decentralisation unit in his Department. With more than €20 million available in 2004, I do not expect too many civil servants to be relocated throughout the country by the end of 2004. The proposal is vague. It does not contain a timeframe except in terms of what the Minister, Deputy Cullen, said this morning. However, I welcome the 450 jobs announced for County Clare; 300 from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with Enterprise Ireland locating in Shannon, and 100 from the Department of Transport with the relocation of the Irish Aviation Authority.During the Tánaiste's recent visit to Shannon Airport she supported the concept of decentralisation to Shannon. Shannon is a good location with an international airport, a sky-lit shopping centre which is currently under construction and on which the Tánaiste turned the sod, and it also has a good road infrastructure. It is geographically well located close to Limerick and Ennis.As a Member who lives in west Clare, I welcome the announcement that for the first time ever a Department will be decentralised to the capital town of west Clare in conjunction with Listowel and Newcastlewest. This was part of the integrated Shannon decentralisation network where all three towns will now get 50 Revenue jobs. I am disappointed Kilrush did not get a greater number of jobs because it has many good attractions, including good quality of life and many building sites, and it is free from traffic jams, unlike our capital city.The timing of the announcement on decentralisation concerns me in that it is just six months before the local and European elections. One must never forget the many promises made and the litany of broken promises after the last election. It is important that the Minister gives the cost and also the target dates for the decentralisation programme.I am disappointed that Department headquarters was not relocated to the mid-west region. Only one has been relocated west of Shannon, that is, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which is to be relocated in Knock Airport. The absence of a voice from County Clare at the Cabinet table has contributed to the fact that nobody lobbied for same in the Cabinet. Ennis would have made an ideal location for a Department headquarters given that it has become a dormitory town in recent times. Its status as the first information town in Ireland and proximity to Shannon Airport would have made it an ideal base. The Tánaiste's visit to Ennis a few weeks ago when she saw the industry and information age park offered a golden opportunity to announce the allocation of a Government headquarters to the town. Trim, Newbridge, Killarney and other towns were selected as locations for departmental headquarters because they have a Cabinet Minister.The real budget was announced on 13 November when the Book of Estimates was published. Let us not forget the increases in the drug payment refund scheme threshold of €8 per month, accident and emergency charges and motor taxation as well as cuts in community and social employment schemes. In addition, we should not forget the bus and train fare increases of 13% in 12 months, to which my colleague, Deputy Naughten, referred, increases in school and college fees and a reduction of 7% in funding for water and sewerage schemes. Development charges will also have a dramatic effect on young people who wish to build homes. I expected something in the budget to aid first-time home buyers, but there is nothing. The increases in the Estimates are all stealth taxes.The budget allocated a meagre €30 million extra to the local authorities fund, which will not even cover benchmarking costs. It is no surprise Clare County Council proposed an increase of 6.9% in commercial rates at its estimates meeting on Monday last. Central government has almost abandoned local government.I lost some time through my colleague and could say much more about the budget. I welcome the additional sum of €30 million for primary and secondary schools, some of which, I hope, will be invested in schools in County Clare, particularly Ennis national school, Clarecastle community school and Kilmihil community school.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Yesterday, the Minister for Finance published this Government's second budget, the seventh in a series from the coalition parties. It is a radical and reforming budget, which is fair and pro-enterprise. Our programme of full-scale decentralisation is bold and imaginative. No Government in the history of the State has acted on this scale for the regions.Our tax reforms and social supports are clearly and consistently designed for the less well-off in our society. Our initiatives for enterprise will transform industry through innovation and sound management of public finances will sustain our economic and social progress. This is a budget for a prosperous, fair and successful Ireland.We have come a long way in recent years. Ten years ago, a book was published entitled, The Jobs Crisis, a collection of the Thomas Davis lectures on RTE. The atmosphere it captured was one of gloom and despondency about jobs. People wrote of a failure of the labour market, strategic thinking and a political culture which settled for mass unemployment. Ten years later, no one can suggest that our political culture, led by Government, is prepared ever again to accept mass unemployment and emigration.With this budget, no one can be in any doubt that we will achieve balanced regional development. This is a fundamental change in Irish life and I am proud of the role my colleagues and I have played in bringing it about. We will never again settle for the injustice and hopelessness that seemed impossible to lift in 1993 or the unfairness and imbalance of an over-centralised State, services and economy. We have shown there are economic answers, political determination and strategic thinking.People elect politicians to get things done and choose Governments which will confidently pull the major levers of power, make strategic decisions and implement significant reforms. Our decision to decentralise is right for the country and correct in its scale, ambition and results. Decentralisation can only work as a stimulus to the economic development of the regions if it is large-scale, rather than piecemeal. It can only work as Government leading by example for investors if it involves major Government offices. It can only work to inject energy and enthusiasm into communities throughout the country if large numbers of people are involved in many locations. This is the reason the Government is taking the ambitious way forward.Decentralisation will involve more than 10,000 public servants and represents a tremendous opportunity for them, their families and the communities they will join. I am fully confident it will play a major role in improving public services, bringing them much closer to the people. It will change our mental map of Ireland. From now on, we will go around the country, not just up to Dublin. We will become much more like European countries with thriving and balanced development around regional cities and towns.Decentralisation will make our spatial strategy real. Our investment in roads and rail, hospitals, schools and universities will work better nationally and regionally. In my area of ministerial responsibility, more than 1,000 employees of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies will move out of Dublin. Four of our major agencies are moving, with nearly half our people involved. While we have already moved some offices, this is the biggest project yet.I am pleased we will now be able to demonstrate to domestic and international investors that the Government leads by example when we encourage investment in the regions. We can demonstrate the reality that investment everywhere in Ireland is investment in one gateway to the European market.Our radical decentralisation programme takes place in the best possible context, namely, an economic strategy which is delivering sound finances, sustainable growth and strong social supports. Our economic strategy works. It has put Ireland to work and it will keep it at work, with 1.8 million people, 600,000 more than in 1993, now at work.The past few years have been tougher. We have made the hard decisions and addressed the challenges created by the international slowdown. Public spending is under control and being increased in line with economic growth and our ability to pay. Better expenditure management means we have the resources to target public spending with more fairness and effectiveness and lower borrowing costs by keeping debt low. It also means we have the confidence and the competitiveness to grow.Inflation is lower, which delivers better value for all of us, individuals and families and the public and private sectors. With the budget increases, low inflation means real improvements for the less well-off in society and in standards of living. It means real protection for savings.Taxes are low. Keeping them low and fair continues to be at the heart of our economic strategy for jobs and growth. Our tax policies are a means to an end – they work for fairness, jobs and growth. In the budget, we are again keeping taxes fair and low across the board. Our tax reforms are designed first and foremost for the lower paid. Some 90% of the minimum wage of €7 per hour, which comes into effect next February, will be kept out of the tax net.We have made our tax system more progressive and fair. In 1997, a single person earning the average industrial wage of €19,372 paid 28% of it in tax. In 2003, the average industrial wage has risen to €28,171, a mark of the economic progress we have made in six short years. A single person on this wage paid just 18% of it in tax. In our time in Government, earnings are up, taxes are down and our tax reforms and cuts have delivered real benefits for those on low and average incomes.We have been criticised for not increasing the standard rate band this year. While I recognise concerns about the number of people paying the 42% rate on marginal income – this should be addressed in future budgets – I will take no lessons about keeping taxes low from people and parties who bitterly opposed every hard-fought reduction we made in the infamous top rate of 65%. From some of the ill-informed comment, one would think we had lowered the standard rate band. I assure the House that no PAYE taxpayer will lose money from income tax policies in this budget. People who earn more will pay more tax. A taxpayer pays at a higher rate only if his or her earnings increase and only on those higher earnings. It used to be that people lost more than half their overtime in tax. We have done away with that permanently. That is fair and socially just and it is what a low tax approach delivers.For those who are working hard to start up, manage and develop businesses we are saying we are with them and that we understand and value them. True to our economic strategy and against the advice of others, we have not increased PRSI on jobs. We have not doubled capital gains tax or increased corporation tax. Instead, we have introduced a series of new measures so that the tax system further supports initiative, risk-taking and innovation.The new research and development tax credit for incremental research and development will give clear support to our strategy of transforming industry through innovation. Innovation and research are the key to our future and to becoming a knowledge economy. It is a European and an Irish priority. However, up to now, we invested less than 1.5% of GDP in research and development. That is less than the shared European target of 3% and a lot less than some leading countries, such as Finland and Sweden, where research and development investment is already more than 3%.The research and development tax credit complements our direct programmes of growing Ireland's research performance through the third level colleges, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, along with the sectoral research agencies. It dovetails with our major investment of more than €340 million of public resources in research and development announced in the Estimates for 2004. In my departmental Vote investment in research and development is up 36%.We are also removing stamp duty on the registration of patents. The encouragement of patents is also a European and a national priority. We want to give all possible support to the generation of new ideas and products. We are underlining that Ireland intends to become a world leader in converting ideas into jobs.We are supporting new business start-ups and development by extending and improving the business expansion and seed capital schemes. This will continue the practice of supporting in the tax system those who take risks and who find it difficult sometimes to finance their businesses. By keeping section 481 film relief until 2008, we will continue to build up expertise and employment in the film industry here.We are also improving the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for headquarters activity. These initiatives show again how important the role our tax system plays in shaping the environment for enterprise and employment in our country. It is an integrated system that we shape for the needs of our people and our economy. It is an essential part of our mix of policies that take account of our skill base, our location and our infrastructural needs. Our low corporation tax rate will deliver more than €5 billion in tax revenue next year. That is equivalent to nearly all our capital investment. For these reasons, as well as for our democratic life, it is vital that we keep national control over our direct tax policies in all aspects. This is the firm stance Ireland is taking at the negotiations on the new EU constitutional treaty.I am pleased to highlight today that the Government is increasing tax relief for contributions to trade unions by members. Trade unions have made a strategic contribution to our economic success in successive partnership agreements. They have helped to create stability, fairness and reform in our country, while vindicating the rights of their members.Every civilised society honours, respects and cares for the older generation. Our commitment to older people is fundamental to justice in our society. Our older people have worked to build our country. They have educated and reared the next generation and they have paid their taxes. That is why we give top priority to the real value of their pensions. In 1997, my party colleagues and I first set an ambitious target of £100 per week pension for the elderly in our society. This was adopted with our coalition partners in the programme for Government in 1997. Our commitment was not alone delivered on, but exceeded within four budgets. If I remember correctly, the pension was approximately £77 in 1997.The Government set a new target of €200 per week for the old age pension and we are also meeting that commitment. This year's budget again increases pensions by €10 per week to bring the contributory pension to €167.30 per week. In every budget in which I have been involved the Government has increased pensions substantially and well in excess of inflation. On 1 January next the weekly pension will be up by €60 in five years. That is an increase of 59%, which is almost three times price inflation of 22%. That is real economic progress, delivering real increases for pensioners and real improvements in standards of living.Parents are in the best position to make child care choices for their children, whether it is full-time or part-time in a crèche, at home or with family or neighbours. The fair way to support all parents, particularly mothers, is child benefit. From next year, a family with two children will receive €3,158 in child benefit. A family with four children will receive more than €7,000. Five years ago a family with two children received just €960 and a family with four received €2,240. Child support has been increased more than three times over in that time. That is real, sustained support for all families and it puts the naysaying about the standard rate tax band in perspective.I am pleased that the Government has agreed in the budget to provide a further €25 million for services for people with disabilities. That underlines our commitment to constant improvement, while recognising that, as a society, we are still building our services and supports after a late start.

It has already resulted in the population and employment increasing in every county. It will now result in Government and public services working in every county. This is a budget for big change. It makes a decisive step forward for balanced regional development. It will change the face and mental map of Ireland. Our economic strategy is not to bring back the Celtic tiger or anything else. It is forward looking and it is about innovation, reform and change. We have designed the strategy, we are making the policies and we are taking the actions. It is about the constant renewal of jobs and opportunity in every county. It is about finding new ways of succeeding without repeating the mistakes or successful formulas of the past. It is about public sector modernisation, how public servants work, where they work and at what they work.This budget shows that our economic strategy is for the whole of society and for every part of the country. It is for people at work, wanting work and who have completed work in the public sector, the private sector and the voluntary sector in every county. It is for the young, the old, those in between, those who need an extra hand, those with the ideas and energy to build our wealth and those who enrich us with creativity and artistry. Our budget is for all society, for a fairer society and for a successful new Ireland of the regions.

When I outlined the Estimates for my Department on 13 November, I acknowledged the increased investment in education of €687 million and said it was a good day for education. Yesterday's budget brought that increase to more than €717 million. That is a clear statement of the Government's commitment to continuing investment in education. Yesterday was a better day for education than 13 November. Yesterday's budget also clearly outlined the continuing commitment of the Government to education, social welfare and health expenditure and to increased investment in infrastructure.The budgetary approach of the Government is founded on sound economic and fiscal policies. The economy has performed exceptionally well in a period when the global economy was regarded to have embarked on a slowdown.

There are almost 5,000 additional primary level teachers and more than 1,600 additional second level teachers. Our level of spending on school buildings has more than quadrupled since 1997, when Deputy Durkan was a member of the rainbow Government.In the Budget Statement, a welcome additional €30 million was announced for the capital programme, which will increase the primary school capital programme to over €200 million, a record level.

My Department has been to the fore in implementing the Government's pilot programming of PPP projects and the experience gained will inform future projects. I have visited some of the new PPP schools and am very impressed by what has been achieved in a short period of time. I look forward to extending the programme into the future. I share the views expressed yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, about the need to achieve a better balance of risks on construction contracts. As with the PPP process, my Department will be to the fore in pursuing better value for the taxpayer from investment in education.I warmly welcome the new round of decentralisation plans. My Department has been involved in the first two phases of decentralisation and has been a beneficiary of decisions made. Locating my Department's headquarters in Mullingar makes sense strategically for the Department and will help deliver a better service to our customers.Over the past half decade, the Government has doubled investment in education. We have vastly increased the numbers employed in the sector, because that is how the service is delivered. I do not agree with the criticisms of benchmarking, particularly in the education sector. The service has to be delivered by teachers who deserve to be well paid. We need to attract to the profession people of the highest calibre.In the budget the Government has again prioritised education. The Government's record level of investment allows us to deliver on our commitments in Sustaining Progress; to drive modernisation and change; to continue our determination to make a difference – an educational difference – to students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds and to make huge inroads into eliminating sub-standard schools and providing new schools and additional educational facilities throughout the country.In the budget, the Government maintained sound economic and fiscal policies and it prioritised continuing investment in education. The budget is in the national interest and it deserves the support of all sides of the House.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	350	There is one matter which concerns me and which is of paramount importance. It is the effect of the budget on the efficiency of the Civil Service. I have enormous admiration for the Civil Service and regard it as one of the great achievements of the State. Kevin O'Higgins and others who insisted on the non-political character of the Civil Service by establishing the Civil Service Commission did incalculable good for the country.I speak also as a member of the Government that introduced the top level appointments commission, the purpose of which was to ensure mobility within the Civil Service and to end the confinement of talent within Departments. The Civil Service thus has an essential unity, which has underpinned the unity of the State.I have personal worries about the effect the budget will have on this great Irish institution. I raise these concerns as queries in the hope they can be satisfactorily answered. It is wrong to describe the move of 10,000 civil servants away from Dublin as decentralisation. It is recentralisation of parts of the Civil Service to a series of different places.I strongly favour a policy of genuine decentralisation with decision making devolved to regional offices of every Department in every region, so that instead of housing policy, for example, being formulated in Dublin or Wexford to apply to the whole country, it would be formulated by regional offices in several different locations with some measure of local discretion. This genuine decentralisation is exactly the policy this Government is attempting to reverse in the health service. We already have decentralisation through the health boards, which have been making decisions in the regions accessible to their citizens. The Government now proposes to do away with decentralised health boards and centralise health policy in a single national board. The Government's policy is not one of decentralisation but of recentralisation.My criticism of some parts of the Government's proposals is that they subordinate the effectiveness of senior decision making in the Civil Service to other purposes. Ultimately, the primary purpose of the Civil Service should be to make wise decisions and implement them efficiently. I agree there is scope to move those who are involved in the implementation of policy out of Dublin. Implementation of policy is a mechanical process and using modern communications it can be done from almost anywhere. Therefore, it makes excellent sense to do it at lower cost outside Dublin. On that basis there is scope for moving considerable numbers of public servants out of Dublin. On the Minister's list, probably 5,000 of the decentralised jobs are involved with the implementation of policy and there is no problem with moving those jobs out of Dublin – it makes excellent sense.The making of wise policy at headquarters, however, requires constant and easy contact among decision makers in all Departments. It also requires that senior Civil Service decision makers be easily accessible to members of the public and organisations that wish to make representations to them. On that basis I question the decision to decentralise in multiple locations outside the capital the policy making functions of certain Civil Service and State bodies. What is a capital city and why does every country have one? Capital cities exist in most democracies to make policy at national level. This is done in one place because there are inherent economies of scale in making policy in one place. A capital city need not be the biggest city in the country – there is a strong case for designating a western city as the capital of Ireland. However, I must question this budget's attempt to dissolve the notion of a capital city altogether by dissipating the nation's policy function over a dispersed geographic area. I would be interested to hear of other countries anywhere in the world in which policy making, as distinct from policy implementation, has been subdivided geographically in the way this budget proposes.At the moment, if there is to be co-ordination of sports policy and rural development policy, the senior decision makers involved, who are located in one city, can meet readily at a moment's notice. In future, senior decision makers in sports policy will be in Killarney while their counterparts in rural development policy will be in Knock. If they are to meet they must spend large amounts of the working day travelling from one centre to the other. Meetings organised at short notice will be completely impossible. What if the Cavan county manager wants to meet a senior decision maker in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss housing policy in Cavan? At the moment he can do so by travelling to the Custom House in Dublin. In future he must travel all the way around Dublin and down to Wexford. Conversely, if the Wexford county manager wants to meet senior officials in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources about broadband roll-out in Wexford he must drive all the way to Dublin, on to Cavan and back again. This is not very efficient.At least these county managers will receive travelling expenses. What about a voluntary tourist association in Donegal? Its representatives will be obliged to travel all the way to Killarney to meet officials from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, staying overnight, although they can currently do all their business in one day. If they use public transport they must travel via Dublin anyway. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whose headquarters is in Dublin, is to meet the Garda Commissioner, one or other must make the journey from the Department in Dublin to Garda headquarters in Thurles or vice versa. Furthermore, if a senior official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform wants to have a three-cornered meeting with representatives of the Garda and the Irish Prison Service, it will have to take place somewhere between Longford, Thurles and Dublin.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I am glad the Minister is laughing. It will be even more difficult for interdepartmental committees to function. There are 300 or more interdepartmental committees or boards on which civil servants sit as representatives of their Ministers. The functioning of these interdepartmental committees will be made much more difficult as the civil servants involved must come to meetings from the four corners of Ireland rather than from areas in close proximity to one another. The allocation for travelling expenses in the public service will need to be substantially increased as journeys to meetings by senior decision makers, which can now be accomplished with a ten minute walk, will in future require a three-hour car or rail journey. Has the Minister done an estimate of these costs?It will be possible to do business by means of telephone, fax, e-mail or teleconferencing, but only up to a point. Most modern business people say there is no substitute for direct face-to-face contact between senior decision makers in a business. Civil servants based in Killarney, Cavan, Shannon, Birr, Wexford and Limerick will need to be in Dublin so often to appear before Dáil committees, brief their Ministers for Dáil appearances, take part in interdepartmental committees and meet delegations that are unable to travel all the way to the new headquarters that they will need a large special allowance to maintain second homes in Dublin.One of the most consistent and serious criticisms of the Civil Service has been the existence of "departmentalitis"– the pursuit of narrow departmental objectives rather than the overall objectives of Government. One of the aims of TLAC was to reduce this. The more individual Departments are physically removed from one another and the less their staff meet, formally and informally, the greater will be the risk of departmentalitis. We have been told that for an individual civil servant, moving to one of the new headquarters outside Dublin will be voluntary. We should not forget that for most people a move to headquarters will be a promotion. Thus, although refusing to move may be a choice, it would involve declining promotion and therefore substantial damage to one's career. In many cases this will mean that the best people do not apply for promotion because it would adversely affect the lives of their families. We must bear in mind that many of the spouses of senior civil servants also have careers. The result is that the best people will not apply for promotion in key Departments.I am sorry to be making these remarks because my constituency will benefit from decentralisation. There will be a headquarters in Trim, which is near enough to Dublin that commuting is viable, although I have no pride in that fact. I worry, however, about the effect this will have on the efficiency and unity of the Civil Service. The Civil Service is one of the great achievements of this country. I am particularly proud of it. I have spent more time as a Minister than any other Member of the House, in terms of the length of time since I first became one. I first worked with the Civil Service as a very junior Minister in 1973 and I have much respect for the integrity and efficiency of its members. I do not think it should be used for purposes such as advancing regional policy. It is there to serve one country, not several.If we want to move people out of Dublin we should move the entire Government out of Dublin, including the Dáil. That is not as foolish an idea as it sounds – Canberra and Brasilia are examples of how it can be done. I would have no problem with that because at least the key decision makers would be kept together. To disperse the decision makers so that they have no chance of meeting, so that no esprit de corps can develop among assistant secretaries dealing with similar subjects across departmental lines, makes no administrative sense. The Ceann Comhairle, who has experience of working in Government, knows this cannot work. It is a foolish policy devised entirely for short-term political gain and I fear it will cause harm. I hope I am wrong, because my own constituency is a beneficiary. However, I fear I am right.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4 and 64 together.Before dealing with these questions, I know the House will wish to join me in expressing deepest sympathy to the family of the late Sergeant Derek Mooney on their tragic loss and in acknowledging the sacrifice made by him in the cause of peace in Liberia. On Thursday, 27 November 2003, Sergeant Mooney was tragically killed following a road traffic accident in Liberia, while involved in a routine familiarisation patrol approximately 40 km south of Monrovia. I would also like to express sympathy to the other Defence Forces personnel who were injured in the accident and to wish them a speedy recovery.As the House will be aware, on 24 September, 2003, the Government authorised, subject to Dáil approval, the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. The necessary enabling resolution was passed by Dáil Éireann on 12 November 2003. The Irish contingent being deployed for service with UNMIL comprises a motorised infantry battalion, of some 430 personnel. A small number of additional personnel has been deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. At the request of the UN, a contingent of the army ranger wing, amounting to some 40 personnel, has been deployed for a three-month period.The main Irish contingent will operate as the force commanders rapid reaction reserve. The role of the Irish personnel will be the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation. In the initial stages, the Irish battalion will act in a pathfinding role for UN brigades deploying beyond Monrovia.Deployment to UNMIL will be completed by mid-December 2003. Initial deployment will be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the case of UNMIL, my intention is that Defence Forces involvement will not exceed two to three years in duration. Elections which are due in 2005 under a comprehensive peace agreement should be completed at that stage.A detailed reconnaissance and threat assessment has been undertaken in the mission area by a Defence Forces team. The military authorities have reported that Liberia is potentially a dangerous theatre of operations. Because of the threat, force protection is a primary concern for the Defence Forces. However, this threat should decline as the UN peacekeeping troops are deployed beyond Monrovia in the next phase of deployment.The safety and health of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me and, I know, to my colleagues in this House. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is my policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission.A wide range of equipment and force protection assets are being deployed with the contingent. This equipment is of the highest quality. The Mowag APCs were deployed with the Defence Forces when they served in the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, where they performed effectively. We are also deploying armoured vehicles and support weapons, heavy machine guns and a mortar platoon. Due to the equipment modernisation programmes that have taken place in the Defence Forces over the past few years, UNMIL will be the best equipped battalion from Ireland ever to serve overseas.From a health perspective, I am confident that we have taken every reasonable step to ensure the good health of our personnel on this mission. The battalion will be equipped with a state of the art medical facility. This facility will be operated by two medical doctors, who will be assisted by a team of 13 Defence Forces medical personnel and paramedics. Special training on the environmental health issues arising in a tropical setting is being provided to our medical personnel by Dutch experts. Additional medical personnel are also being deployed because of the particularly hazardous nature of the health environment. The battalion will be bringing its own water purification plant and sewage treatment plant.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The availability of back-up medical arrangements has also been ensured. A full surgical medical facility is being provided to the mission, initially by the Netherlands, which has dispatched a fully equipped naval hospital ship to Liberia to provide medical assistance facilities to the UN peacekeeping mission, and thereafter by Jordan. In addition, there is a Red Cross medical facility in Monrovia and a full surgical medical facility in Freetown. I would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by the Dutch medical team to the member of the Defence Forces injured in last week's accident.I commend the individual members of the Permanent Defence Force who have served, and who continue to serve, on overseas missions, together with their families and loved ones. As we enter into the Christmas season, I know it will be a difficult time for the families, with loved ones far from home. However, I hope that the arrangements we are putting in place with the provision of telephone services, Internet access and a direct mail service will help ensure that there is good and effective ongoing contact between our peacekeepers and their families. Finally, I would like to assure the House that the Government will do whatever it can to protect our personnel and return them safely to their families.

Everyone agrees this was a tragic start to this tour of duty by our peacekeeping forces in Africa. For a number of reasons this the most dangerous mission that has been undertaken by the Defence Forces since they were in the Congo, 40 years ago. This is a war-torn country with armed gangs and even child soldiers running around armed to the teeth. It is a country ravaged by disease as well. Geographically it is very near what used to be known as the "white man's grave".Is the Minister satisfied the Defence Forces have the best equipment to carry out their duties there? There were reports that some of the armoured cars being used on this mission go back to the time they were in the Congo, 40 years ago. Is that true, and if so, are these vehicles up to standard, safe and dependable? Is the Minister confident the medical expertise and backup are available to provide the best possible medical services for these personnel who are serving in Liberia on our behalf?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I thank Deputy McGinley for his support and concern and his expression of sympathy to the Mooney family. I also thank him for his attendance at Sergeant Mooney's funeral.The Defence Forces have the best equipment they have ever had. This mission could not have been undertaken because of the associated risks were it not for the fact that the Defence Forces are much better equipped now. They have used the Mowag personnel carriers in UNMEE and they have worked well in Eritrea and Ethiopia.We were concerned to ensure that the best possible arrangements were in train in terms of the health risks, through the programme that has been initiated in training, preparation and inoculation before the forces leave for Liberia. The field hospital will be run by two doctors with 13 backup personnel and paramedics, with support from the Dutch in training and environmental matters associated with tropical settings. We are grateful to the Dutch whose ship provides tertiary medical backup with world-class surgical and medical facilities. They have arrived in Liberia in the last few days. Hospitals run by the International Committee of the Red Cross are in Monrovia, also.We are determined, as far as we can, to ensure that the best possible arrangements are put in place. I assure the House that everything we can possibly do is being done. There are particular risks attached to the mission, as Deputy McGinley said, not just from the physical dangers entailed, but also on the health side. It is a necessary obligation we have to take on and since our soldiers are prepared to go there we are obliged to make sure they have the equipment, the back-up support and the health facilities that are required.As we approach Christmas, 430 soldiers have volunteered to go to Liberia. I thank them for volunteering to go and I thank their families who will miss them, particularly during the Christmas. They will be away from their families undertaking this serious mission. I will do all I can to ensure they have everything necessary to keep them safe.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The death of Sergeant Derek Mooney graphically illustrated the dangers facing our troops in Liberia. I extend my sympathy to the family of the dead soldier.What is the total number of personnel travelling? What specialised training is being provided for the troops? Are they being provided with appropriate uniforms and equipment for use in tropical areas? As concern has been expressed that militia groups in Liberia have rocket grenade launchers at their disposal, what equipment is available to troops to protect themselves against this threat? Will the medical team be in place from the beginning?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Rocket propelled grenades are not a new threat to the Defence Forces. They encountered them in Lebanon, Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Meeting head on such difficulties is not new to the Defence Forces. There are approximately 430 personnel involved. As is the case for all missions, the first requirement is for expert personnel in the Defence Forces to do the reconnaissance work and assess the mission requirements in terms of equipment, medical requirements and the threat involved. They then report to me whether it is a mission that can be undertaken. The mission will only be undertaken following the assessment and approval of the Government and this House. It is a very serious decision in the first instance.Deputy Sherlock can be satisfied that the preparatory work done on the risk assessment has proved over the years to be of an expert nature. He asked about training in particular. He will probably appreciate that one of the great morale boosters for the Defence Forces is the opportunity to serve overseas in missions which involve such challenges. The preparatory training carried out is of a very high calibre. Our soldiers like to have an opportunity to serve overseas. The commanders and people in charge, depending on the nature and requirements of the mission, could have anything up to three months training in advance. In some instances, it is of a shorter duration for members of the Defence Forces who have multiple experience in missions of this kind. The Deputy can be assured that the training and preparatory work is not just of an expert nature, but takes into account all the exigencies of the situation.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Will they be allowed home leave during their tour of duty on this occasion? I believe it is customary that they are allowed home leave or that their relatives are entitled to visit. Are there any such arrangements in place for this tour?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	359	We certainly try to improve communications between members of the Defence Forces and their families. Telephone arrangements, Internet access and so on are put in place. We are considering what else can be done in the circumstances in Liberia which is different from previous missions. We have not yet made a decision but we will assess the situation.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	360	At its meeting on 29 September the Government set up a group comprising the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Finance and me to deal with the evolving industrial relations situation in the Prison Service, including the putting in place of contingency arrangements in the event of industrial action. Prior to that there had been direct contacts at official level between the Irish Prison Service and my Department and the Defence Forces, and with the Garda authorities.It continues to be the hope of the Government that this matter can be settled without recourse to industrial action. However, in line with the Government decision, I can confirm that contingency planning is at an advanced stage for the possible use of Defence Forces personnel in the event of industrial action in the prisons. The question of training is being addressed in the context of the contingency planning.Since the deployment of military personnel is specifically excluded from the scope of representation, the question of discussion or consultation with the Defence Forces representative associations does not arise. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate to provide details of the contingency plans being put in place. Suffice to say that the Government has a duty to ensure the prison system continues to operate in the event of industrial action by prison staff.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	361	Has a formal request been received from the prison authorities for assistance in the event of a dispute? Does the Minister consider it appropriate that troops should be used in this role or as pawns in the dispute between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Prison Officers Association?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Defence Forces would not be used as pawns in any circumstances. In a democratic society there is an obligation on a Government to ensure the prison system operates efficiently and effectively. The Deputy will appreciate that where there is potential for circumstances to arise, extreme though they may be, where prison officers might not run the Prison Service, there is an obligation on the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to put in place certain arrangements. In this case, the operation would be put in place by the Garda Síochána. The members of the Defence Forces would act under its instructions, as prescribed over so many Governments in terms of the role of the Defence Forces, to defend the State and aid the civil power in specific circumstances. I hope this will not happen and that the matter can be resolved without such intervention. However, in extreme circumstances where the Prison Service must be operated without prison officers, the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces will become involved, but there is still time to resolve the matter.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I note when replying the Minister stated there was no consultation with representative organisations. Will he elaborate on this? If the troops are used in this role, will they be entitled to special allowances, will they take part on a voluntary basis or will personnel be compelled to act as substitute warders?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The deployment of military personnel on any mission is a matter for the Government and the Dáil. The matter is not subject to discussions with the representative associations. In the event of this action taking place, allowances, which are already the subject of discussion, will be made, but I cannot say what the specific payments will be. They are quite generous. The Deputy can be assured that, in the event of the Defence Forces being involved, subject to direction from the Garda Síochána, in the event of a breakdown in negotiations between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the prison officers, Army personnel will receive appropriate allowances. My understanding is that, by most standards, the allowances are reasonably generous.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Will the personnel be compelled to act as substitute wardens?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I have never experienced a circumstance where the Defence Forces have been found wanting when asked to meet their obligations in aid to the civil power, or where questions have been asked about whether their assistance was volunteered or otherwise. It has never arisen. The Deputy will recall circumstances in the Border and the fallout from many strikes of different kinds with which the Defence Forces have had to deal. It has never been brought to my attention that they have been found wanting in meeting their obligations as set out and established by successive Governments.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The reduction in Defence Forces authorised numbers will be 250 and not 400. The target strength of the Permanent Defence Force will remain at 10,500, which is the figure set out in the Defence White Paper in February 2000. On 31 October 2003, the most recent date for which figures are available, the total strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 10,469. Therefore, the question of a reduction in numbers serving does not arise.In future, recruits in training will be provided for within the overall White Paper strength of 10,500. The current special provision for up to an additional 250 recruits in training over and above the 10,500 figure will no longer apply. The Government remains fully committed to the policy of ongoing recruitment to ensure that an overall strength of 10,500 is achieved and maintained over time.The reduction of 250 in the overall maximum number of recruits in training will be phased in over three years. The figure of 250 is a contribution to the reduction in the overall size of the public service to be achieved by the end of 2005.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	368	Does the Minister agree there is serious concern among the representative bodies? I am aware he has attended two meetings of PDFORRA and that concern was expressed at a further reduction in the overall strength of the Permanent Defence Force. Such a reduction would be contrary to undertakings given in the White Paper for which the Minister was responsible. According to the White Paper, the overall strength of the Permanent Defence Force was to be 10,500 with 2,500 in training.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The figure was 250.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Yes. Will the Minister certify that the agreement in the White Paper has been breached? Does he agree this is the wrong time to cut back on the Permanent Defence Force when there are unprecedented demands in terms of peacekeeping, security at home and especially the next six months when Ireland assumes the EU Presidency?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I suppose there is never a right time. The present strength is 10,469. Nobody involved in the Defence Forces will lose his or her job or be asked to leave. In his budget last year, the Minister for Finance decided that, over a period of three years, there should be a reduction of 5,000 in the public service. Our contribution to that reduction is 250 and an additional 150 to be taken from civilian employees and from civil servants in my Department.The main thrust of the White Paper was for an overall Permanent Defence Force strength of 10,500 to span a ten year period with an additional 250 in training. We have held closely to that commitment. There has been no period in our history of which I am aware where there was a Government decision to maintain a membership of 10,500 over ten years which involved a reduction in personnel, the resources from which would be invested in new equipment and infrastructural development. It gives historic certainty to the Defence Force in terms of planning and development. We accept the reduction of 250 in the context of the overall reduction of 5,000 in the public service.I assure Deputy McGinley that we have a White Paper commitment to 10,500 over ten years and all the savings will be dedicated to infrastructural development and the purchase of equipment to enable our Defence Force to be a top class professional force. It would be easier and nicer if we did not have to face the consequences of this reduction. We are, however, in the best position to manage that reduction and to go forward with the certainty of 10,500 during that period.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	372	There was also a commitment in the White Paper that savings accruing from a further reduction in the Permanent Defence Force would be reinvested. Will the Minister give the House an estimate of the savings arising from the reduction of 250 and indicate if those savings will be reinvested in the Defence Force for the purchase of equipment and modernisation?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I want to continue that policy which is a unique agreement between the Departments of Defence and Finance in the development of the Defence Forces. I see no reason I cannot do that. Given that the overall number is approximately 10,460, I do not have specific savings that I can dedicate. The principle of devoting the savings from the personnel reduction and the sale of surplus property is being applied.In fairness to the Minister for Finance, he allocated these resources to me prior to being able to make the savings, so a considerable amount has already been expended. It is a policy which secures the development of the infrastructure and equipment of the Defence Forces into the future. If we are taking the pain, we are taking the gain.
Question No. 4 answered with Question No. 1.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The Government has committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing coming through the new affordable housing initiative under Sustaining Progress and through existing affordable housing schemes. The announcement in July this year of the proposed release of Department of Defence lands at Magee Barracks, Kildare, and Gormanston, County Meath, as well as a number of sites in the administration of the Office of Public Works, was a critical first step in ensuring early delivery of affordable housing under this initiative which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Officials in the Minister's Department have met officials from my Department and the relevant local authorities about the two sites because it is envisaged that the local authorities will have an important role in ensuring delivery of affordable housing at these sites. Work on implementing this initiative is progressing as a priority and this is firm evidence of the Government's determination to make measurable progress in the implementation of this initiative by the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress in mid-2004.The Government is working with the parties to the pay agreement to define the precise terms of the initiative, including the eligibility criteria. As the Taoiseach has indicated, the Government is examining the potential to release further State land for this initiative, and a series of meetings has been held with other Departments in this regard.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	When is it likely that the promised sites will be handed over? What is the reason for the delay? Is it not the case that it is more than a year since this initiative was announced in Sustaining Progress and no progress has been made? What steps is the Minister taking to expedite the hand-over of the property concerned? There have been considerable delays in the transfer of Defence Forces property, as with Clancy Barracks.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The decision to dispose of Clancy Barracks was made and a contract was finally signed in May 2003 but there are significant title matters to be addressed. I would prefer if such matters did not arise but they must be cleared up. The sale of Clancy Barracks is almost concluded and the matter will soon be out of the way.There are considerations involved in disposing of the land for affordable housing. The matter is being orchestrated and managed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in consultation with the local authorities. The question of zoning arises because these lands were excluded from all development plans since no one envisaged that they would become available. I decided to dispose of them and the question of affordable housing then arose. These matters are being dealt with. It is only six months since the decision was made and I need to see benefits for the Department of Defence as a result of that decision.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Will the Minister indicate whether lands have been handed over? Is there a waiting list of properties that will be handed over at a future date? What properties will be involved?
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	378	What size are the sites that will be handed over? It will be beneficial to those who will be housed on the sites but how many units will they accommodate? Is there a problem with the leasing of the properties?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	In McKee Barracks in County Kildare there are 58 acres of land and there are a further 260 acres in Gormanstown Barracks in County Meath. The housing density will depend on the final arrangements and the provision of services. I have no further plans to hand over additional land.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	380	Is there a leasing problem?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	381	No.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 58 and 59 together.The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical threats identified from time to time. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Ordnance Corps. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.The Defence Forces hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment which meets their current requirements. In particular, 7,000 new NBC suits have been acquired. In addition, the Defence Forces have sufficient stocks of respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up-to-date chemical agent monitors and Defence Forces personnel have been trained in their operation. Other equipment on hand includes biological agent detector and screening kits, group decontamination equipment and personal decontamination equipment.The Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power – assisting the Garda Síochána – which includes the protection and guarding of vital installations and the provision of certain security escorts.Consultation on roles and requirements for the EU Presidency is currently ongoing between the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, who will render such assistance as may be appropriate. Obviously the security of key EU Presidency meetings is important and it would be inappropriate for me to indicate the nature and extent of any roles which the Defence Forces may undertake.The most important defence against an attack is external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are being deployed to this end.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Is the Minister satisfied that adequate equipment is available to the Defence Forces to allow them to deal with all threats of chemical or biological attack? Is cover available in all parts of the country on a 24 hour basis? How many times were the Defence Forces called out in the past year to deal with suspect chemical or biological devices?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	384	During the anthrax scare, over 200 calls were logged and the Defences Forces dealt with them competently. Arising from that experience, the screening kits and other facilities were purchased to enable us to do the preliminary tests on substances and give an initial assessment of the problem using our own resources. These facilities are distributed across the country and valuable experience and training has been gained in their use, particularly during the anthrax scare.I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department of Health and Children for the support we received from them in developing the protocols for dealing with scares of this kind and ensuring public confidence in the way we do things. How can I say, however, that we have everything we need, not knowing what the threat will be? We assess it as best we can and are as well prepared as possible.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Has the Government accepted the Minister's proposal to establish a statutory office to co-ordinate emergency planning?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I am chairman of the Office of Emergency Planning. We might reach the stage where the decision would be taken to establish the office on a statutory basis but we have not yet reached it. Much work has been done and all Departments and agencies have co-operated in the development of the emergency planning system to ensure we have an effective management structure in which there can be public confidence. The Government has not yet decided whether a statutory office would be appropriate but I have strong views on the matter and it might be wise in the medium to long-term to put this on a statutory basis.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Gas masks and breathing apparatus equipment are basic protective devices in the event of an attack. Has such equipment been purchased recently in case it is needed?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I could not give the Deputy the exact nature of all the different types of masks and the protection kits that we have but the military authorities assure me that additional funding is being provided on an ongoing basis in light of the experiences that we are gaining. I will try to give him greater detail later but we have a large number of items.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The Defence Forces commenced a programme to acquire Mowag APC or light armoured vehicles in 1999. To date 40 of these vehicles have been received and a further 25 vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2004. The total cost of the programme is in the region of €84 million. In addition to this programme, the Defence Forces has a requirement for a smaller light armoured vehicle, designated as a light tactical vehicle which can be used to protect troops engaged in peace support operations in areas where the larger Mowag APC would be inappropriate. For instance, the movement of one to three personnel in high risk confined areas and general surveillance work are among the key roles of the vehicle.Funding for this programme must be considered in the context of the larger APC programme and the changed financial situation. It has been agreed with the military authorities that the programme for the acquisition of the vehicles will not proceed for the present. In the meantime, the Defence Forces will continue to conduct further studies on the type and specification of vehicle required.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	390	Does the Minister accept that these vehicles could have been of significant assistance to the Irish contingent going to Liberia? Has money been allocated in the Estimates for 2004 for these vehicles, or has the plan been abandoned?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	391	When we decided to send members of the Defence Forces on the mission to Kosovo the military authorities said they would require a particular kind of vehicle known as DROPS, costing approximately €200,000 each. We immediately put a tender process in train and purchased approximately 24 of those at that price. There are 65 armoured personnel carriers at a total cost of €84 million which are the most appropriate vehicles for Liberia, having been tried in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The military authorities have not said that not proceeding with the light tactical vehicles creates problems for us in the Liberian mission as the Mowags are available there. This is one of the programmes with which we have been unable to proceed but no concern has been expressed to me that the absence of such vehicles creates a problem in Liberia.

I am sure the Minister is aware that many organisations, in particular, the Lebanon Veterans Association, would make good use of these redundant vehicles. Will the Minister agree that these veteran associations have no difficulty getting redundant vehicles from forces other than the Irish Defence Forces, for example, the UK defence forces? Will he use his good offices to make surplus or redundant vehicles available to this worthy and credible organisation whose headquarters are in County Clare adjacent to the Minister's constituency.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I thought Deputies Sherlock and McGinley and the Leas-Ceann Comhairle and I were getting along reasonably well this afternoon and that Deputy McGinley would behave himself, but now he is tormenting me. On a serious note, however, I am looking at that proposition. It has been emphasised that we have several vehicles which have come to the end of their vital use for the Defence Forces and I am sympathetic to that proposition. I have demonstrated that before now because recently I have received requests from the regional technical colleges in Carlow and Dublin for other old vehicles for training purposes and I am anxious to facilitate them. I want, as best I can, to meet the requests of educational or historical societies, museums or similar organisations. I have to be fair-minded about this and have some way of determining how best to proceed. The opportunity to meet the instruction and training requirements of educational and technical colleges appealed to me and I was able to respond. I will see how far I can extend that remit and meet Deputy McGinley's concern.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 21 and 33 together.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. The strength of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service and the number of female personnel by rank within these services, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. The figures provided are as at 31 October 2003 in respect of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 9% of all applicants have been female and on average 9% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.Some 15.4% of applicants for the 2003 cadetship competition were female and 15.5% of successful candidates were female. Women are eligible for service in the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 ft. 4 in. and this height requirement also applies to male recruits.Strength of the Defence Forces31 October, 2003.LtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLtTotalOffrsSMBqmsCSCqmsSgtsCplsTotalNcosPtesCadetsTotalArmy136361183572812281,03032401422491,0651,5793,1074,258998,494Air Corps00121235246013474531513020641534616911Naval Service001213402261139777515199139442455281,064Strength of Females in the Defence Forces31 October, 2003.LtGenMajGenBrigGenColLtColComdtCaptLtTotalOffrsSMBqmsCSCqmsSgtsCplsTotalNcosPtesCadetsTotalArmy0000113303175003110849820815396Air Corps000000123001006711122Naval Service00000021416000001142564

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	402	A couple of years ago I reduced the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 ft. 4 in. I made that decision on the basis of discriminating in favour of women by reducing the height requirement for female applicants below that which was required for male applicants. Unfortunately, under equality legislation I was forced to reduce it for males also. One might regard that as somewhat ridiculous but it was the circumstance that prevailed under equality legislation.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Yes. I felt at the time that there should be discrimination in favour of females on the height requirement.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	408	There is no specific target. When we set out to recruit, the competition is open. Approximately 9% of the applicants for Defence Forces jobs in the non-enlisted sectors are female, and approximately 9% succeed in their applications. In the case of cadets, approximately 15% are applicants and a little more than 15% succeed. We do not have specific gender targets. The competition is open to males and females.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 16 together.The gross Defence Forces Estimate for 2004 is €729 million. My two major priorities for the Department of Defence for 2004 are to maintain the policy of continuous recruitment I introduced in 1998 and to continue the programme of investment in new equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces. Next year's allocation will enable me to maintain progress in both these key areas, and I am satisfied that I have been able to maximise the benefits accruing to the Defence Forces.The provision for the Naval Service in 2004 is €9.284 million. The reduction of 16% in the provision compared with the 2003 provision of €10.996 million is accounted for by a reduction in EU-funded projects in 2004 of €1million and also by the advanced purchasing of fuel stocks in 2003, thereby reducing the requirement in 2004 by €1.1million. I am advised that the provision for 2004 will meet the operational needs of the Naval Service.In recent years, two new ships have been acquired for the Naval Service: the LE Róisín,commissioned in December 1999, and her sister ship, the LE Niamh, commissioned in September 2001. The total cost of the two state-of-the-art ships was more than €50 million. Both ships have proved to be tremendous assets to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles.In addition, new building projects are being carried out at the naval base which include new technical stores and refurbishment of accommodation at an estimated cost of €5 million. I am satisfied that the proposed resources will enable the Naval Service to carry out its roles in an effective and efficient manner.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	411	Eight.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The Minister said in reply to a question on another day that the proposed full complement of Naval Service staff is 1,144. What is the present strength of the Naval Service and how many of its staff are seagoing personnel? I understand that some employees do not go to sea or are not qualified to do so.Does the Minister agree that the Naval Service is under certain strains because the demands on the seagoing staff are greater? They used to spend 180 days at sea annually. The figure has now increased to 190 days per annum and there are plans to increase it to 210 days, which will put a huge strain on people away from home for such long periods.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	There is an eight ship arrangement. That will obviously be maintained, and the LE Róisín and LE Niamh have enhanced the capacity of the Naval Service considerably. In recent years we had requests from Enterprise Ireland for the Naval Service to participate in programmes and events in Savannah and Hong Kong to help promote business for Ireland. Notwithstanding the extra requirements imposed by these three month trips in 2002 and 2003, the number of sea days was increased, as confirmed to me by the Naval Service.I am grateful to the Naval Service for work it did for Enterprise Ireland. The service's staff were great ambassadors, and it was good to see them also working in fisheries protection. The other duties they perform have been added to. Their dedication is tremendous.The position remains that the Naval Service is still short of the 1,144 staff complement. The figure I provided in the House was 1,050 or close to that. We have had a number of competitions for direct entry for electrical artificers and other technical grades. To redress the staff situation, a great deal of preparatory work being carried out, along with the training programmes under way. The Naval Service is operating at full capacity and, while stretched in some technical areas, manages to increase the man days at sea and, at the same time, meet other obligations placed on it.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	414	When Enterprise Ireland requests the Naval Service to participate in foreign trips, does this have an effect on one of the service's main tasks, namely, fisheries protection? In the context of European defence and the inter-operability requirement, will the Naval Service budget cutback mean that there will be less inter-operability? Given the commitments, does the Minister anticipate that the Estimate will have to be increased?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	415	In all areas covered by the Estimates there is great competition for resources, for education, health, the environment and so on. I do not envisage a significant budget increase in the defence area. In recent years we have been able to purchase two new ships at a cost of €44 million. Putting that in a historical context, the last time the State purchased even a second hand ship was in 1984, so this recent period has been important for the Naval Service.One would normally envisage that work for Enterprise Ireland would cut across the ability of the Naval Service to meet all its fisheries protection commitments. However, because of the reorganisation of the Naval Service and the leadership provided by successive flag officers and other staff, the service has been able to increase the days at sea for fisheries protection, drug interdiction and other activities while also undertaking to have one ship engaged for three months in helping Enterprise Ireland in its quest to attract business to Ireland.One could have engaged a costly hotel and invited all the top business people for breakfast, evening meals or whatever, and a certain number would have come, yet the number of people who wanted to get on the LE Róisínwhen it visited Savannah was a revelation. It was an incredible attraction in all the cities and was a really worthwhile success at what one might call minimal cost. The additional cost of the Savannah trip was about €12,000. One could have spent far more trying to do business in the normal way by hiring halls and hotels and so on.It was a tremendous exercise. It was quite special to hear the comments made about the Naval Service personnel and their disposition and skills in meeting and welcoming people. I was able to join them on both trips for short periods. I was very proud of what they did. It is the sort of venture we will continue to examine in the light of that experience. I assure Deputy Gormley, however, that the record shows that, notwithstanding this additional commitment, the man days at sea and the work in fisheries protection were enhanced simultaneously.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The range of services currently provided by the Air Corps include air ambulance, ministerial air transport, search and rescue services, Garda air support and military tasks. As the Deputy will be aware, a Sikorsky S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coastguard from Canadian Helicopter Corporation Ireland pursuant to existing search and rescue contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coastguard to the Air Corps. Canadian Helicopter Corporation Ireland provides and maintains the aircraft while it is flown and operated by Air Corps personnel.The Garda air support unit comprises two helicopters, one a twin-engined AS355N Squirrel helicopter and the other a recently acquired EC 135 helicopter, and one Defender 4000 fixed-wing aircraft. The Garda Síochána is responsible for the operational control and policing functions of the service, the Air Corps personnel have responsibility for all matters relating to the flying of the aircraft and have responsibility for the maintenance of the Squirrel helicopter and the Defender aircraft while the maintenance for the EC 135 will be contracted out. Following a Government decision in November 2001 it had originally been planned to contract out both flying and maintenance for the EC 135. However, for technical, operational and legal reasons this did not prove possible. In April 2002 the Government decided to place the EC 135 on the military register with the Air Corps responsible for flying and that an interdepartmental committee would continue to examine the options for the full implementation of the contract out of the flying and maintenance for the EC 135.The EC 135 became fully operational in early 2003. Maintenance is currently being provided on an interim basis by McAlpine Engineering Limited. A tender for long-term maintenance was issued in December 2002. My Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in contract negotiations with the winning tenderer and it is anticipated that these negotiations will be completed shortly.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Does the Minister accept that there is widespread concern in the Air Corps at what many members see as gradual downgrading of their role in search and rescue operations? Originally, the Air Corps provided all search and rescue services but this role appears increasingly to be handed over to private sector operators.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I am anxious to ensure that the Air Corps plays a full and positive role in search and rescue. Unfortunately, as Deputy Sherlock is aware, we have run into difficulties in the north-west regarding the provision of a full-time search and rescue service on the S61 helicopter. My Department has had contact with the coastal and marine service of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and, regrettably, we are not now in a position to maintain a full-time search and rescue service in that region. We are endeavouring to make sure that, with the exception of full-time winching, all search and rescue services will be provided by our personnel. We are recruiting and requesting people who have previous experience in this technical area to consider returning to it. However, my advice from the Air Corps is that, considering the training requirements involved, it would be August 2004 before we would have a 24-hour service in place to meet all requirements. Meanwhile we will have a day-time 12-hour service which will provide practically everything else and will include some winching. This service will be provided on the basis of the personnel available but, taking account of illness and leave, one cannot guarantee that the service would extend beyond a certain percentage of the time.We are desperately anxious to maintain the service in the Air Corps and we are trying by every means to return to a full-time service. The officer commanding the Air Corps and his staff are doing everything they can to ensure that anyone who is available and wants to go for training is facilitated. We had 17 personnel in the north-west and for a period there was much illness. Of those 17 people, 13 have been redeployed. This has caused considerable problems for all in maintaining the service. The service is important for the Air Corps and one I wish to retain. However, for that to happen the necessary personnel must be in place. We are doing all we can to meet that requirement but we will be unable to provide a 24-hour service for some time.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Can the Minister say it is not his policy to outsource the search and rescue service? The cost of leasing the S61 helicopter is €15 million for three years. Would such an investment not be adequate to provide the service within the Department?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Irish Coastguard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. This is not a matter of money. I have provided, in my Department's Estimate, the €4 million which is required annually for the leasing of this dedicated helicopter which meets all the requirements of search and rescue in our climate and weather conditions. The finances are available. This is a matter of having trained personnel ready and willing to supply the technical aspects of this service, particularly with regard to winching. In the absence of many of the people who were involved I must fill those positions. I assure the Deputy that this is not a matter of financial resources but of providing trained personnel to meet the requirements of a demanding area. Search and rescue is carried out in all kinds of conditions by highly skilled and trained personnel. One cannot take risks with it.I do not want anyone to come from the outside to take over our role. However, I have responsibility for safety of the public. If I am unable to provide the service on a full-time basis I must listen attentively to someone who tells me he can do so.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I am glad the Minister agrees that the search and rescue service provided by the Air Corps in the past has been excellent. We all have experience of how the Air Corps has responded to emergencies along the north-west coast in all weather conditions, since the service was established there. Does the Minister agree that the present situation in the north-west is unsatisfactory due to the fact that we do not have a full search and rescue service? We may have a full search service but not a full-time rescue service due to the absence of winch crews. The Minister has told us it will be 2004 before a full service is operational again. Does he agree that the crisis in the north-west was precipitated by the fact that grievances and concerns were not adequately dealt with? When the Ombudsman Bill, which is before the House, is passed before the end of the year perhaps one of the Ombudsman's first jobs will be to deal with the grievances and concerns expressed by the crews which have been redeployed.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	The limited service of which I spoke involves search, air ambulance, disaster relief, everything except operations requiring a winch crew. We have a winch crew who are prepared to help us but we do not have sufficient numbers to provide the service on a full-time basis. We are not as stranded as one might think. Nonetheless, we do not have a satisfactory, adequate, full-time service. I am anxious to ensure that the process of training and preparation to achieve that is progressed as quickly as possible. I am informed by the commanding officer of the Air Corps that the best they can do will be to meet the requirement in August 2004. In negotiations that take place I am obliged to give full consideration to alternative arrangements which fill that gap.The north-west is a very important area where we have been presented with challenges in the past. It is entitled to have a full-time service. I will enter into negotiations with the Irish Coastguard service and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that as much as possible is done as speedily as possible.

I understand that the remainder of the country has been outsourced, as Deputy Sherlock stated.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Yes, that is the policy. I had no wish to see the present circumstance that has developed. Deputy McGinley mentioned two matters which are to do with industrial relations between the individuals concerned and management in the Air Corps. I have not received a request from any of the representative associations indicating to me that there were specific problems but if there are such problems—
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	425	It is an open secret.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	426	That surprises me somewhat. I have not received a request from the representative associations.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	427	As I indicated previously to the House, investigations are being conducted by the military police and the Garda into the circumstances surrounding the discovery on 15 April 2003 of an improvised explosive device inside the perimeter of Gormanston camp. The IED, which was discovered by a member of the Defence Forces based in the camp, was disarmed by a Defence Forces explosives ordnance disposal team. Sections of the IED were taken away for forensic examination by the Garda. The remainder was destroyed in situ by controlled explosion by the EOD team.I am advised that the outcome of the Garda investigation is not yet available. A report has been requested from the Garda authorities and is awaited. The military police investigation cannot be finalised until the Garda investigation is completed.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Will the Minister state why it has taken so long to conclude the inquiry into this matter? It is more than nine months since the device was found. Does the Minister accept that it is a potentially serious matter to have what appears to have been a pipe bomb found inside a military installation? Has there been a review of security in light of the discovery?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I believe it was seven months ago, not nine months. It is a fairly lengthy period but I do not have authority in this matter. It is entirely a matter for the Garda Síochána. As Deputy Sherlock will be aware, some investigations are conducted very comprehensively and quickly while other investigations take a longer time. I have no way of knowing how long the investigation will take. I am anxious that the Garda investigation would be concluded as quickly as possible. The military police and the military investigation can only proceed once the Garda investigation is completed. Security measures are always tightened up when such devices are discovered. The military technical experts are always directly involved in the assessment of such circumstances.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Deputy Sherlock is an old and shrewd campaigner and he is asking me the same question in another way.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Various analysts have described the budget as a non-event, a draw between the Government and the public. The editorial in one newspaper described it as bland and the lead article stated that stealth tax increases were well hidden in the fine detail. The article described it as a budget designed to minimise problems in the run-up to the June elections. It is probably a little more than that. The budget was well designed to create the minimum of opposition and the minimum of disquiet around the country.The vast majority of decisions about revenue and expenditure had already been made well in advance of the budget. They were published in the Estimates and publicised in various announcements by Ministers and State bodies over the past two or three months. The taxation measures announced by the Minister will have an impact in a full year of approximately €600 million. Total expenditure decisions will be approximately €650 million. That was in the context of an overall budget where total gross expenditure exceeded €43 billion. Budget day decisions only had an impact on not much more than 1% of Government revenues and a similar proportion of total expenditure allocation. The budget is now a non-event, less than 1% of the total consideration.Normally the budget deals with taxation and social welfare, the areas of most concern to people, depending on whether one is a taxpayer or a recipient of social welfare. People have reason to be concerned on both counts. More than 50,000 people will be pushed into the higher income tax bracket next year, following the Minister's failure to raise the standard rate band in line with inflation. The Minister's decision to leave tax bands untouched means that more than one third of all taxpayers will pay income tax at the rate of 42%. That is a penal tax rate for lower income groups who have now been included in the higher tax net.The budget will amplify the negative impact of the application of PRSI and the health levy to benefits in kind. This move was announced in budget 2003 but does not come into effect until next January. In many cases the impact of the new system will negate any increases in take-home pay that would otherwise have been created yesterday. This additional PRSI and levy burden will, for example, mean that an individual earning less than the new PRSI ceiling of €42,160, but who has benefits-in-kind of €4,000 or more, will see his take-home pay decline rather than grow next year. The same will apply to employees who earn more than the PRSI ceiling and who have benefits-in-kind in excess of €12,000. The general social welfare increases announced yesterday of €10 across the board will have little impact on the charges and other indirect taxes with which people will be faced. Consequently, they will be less well-off.The child dependant allowance has come in for particular criticism because the Government has fallen far short of its commitments to address the plight of at least 300,000 children. This problem was highlighted in one of today's national newspapers. The decision has attracted much criticism from anti-poverty groups which claim that the Government has ignored the problem of child poverty. This is the seventh consecutive year in which the child dependant allowance has not been increased.The tourism industry expected that something would be done about competitiveness in the sector. I am glad the former Minister responsible for that sector, the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is present in the Chamber. I am sure tourism is still very close to his heart. The tourism industry is at a turning point in its development and faces a major challenge to regain its competitiveness in light of reduced customer satisfaction ratings, particularly with regard to delivering good value for money. In recent years, there has been a noticeable drop in the perception of good value for money by overseas visitors, which, according to the Fáilte Ireland survey, has declined from 63% in 2000 to 45% in 2002. For visitors the price issue relates not so much to the cost of access and accommodation, which are generally pre-booked, but to the price of eating out, food and drink in shops and the general cost of living when they get here.The Government can claim, with some justification, that it has eased the burden of personal and business taxation but the same cannot be said of our VAT rates and excise duties, which are among the highest in the eurozone and contribute to unfavourable price differentials in certain key tourism products in Ireland compared with our main competitors such as Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece.With the introduction of the euro there is now total cost transparency among the 12 eurozone countries. The consumer pricing report, published in May by Forfás, indicated that Ireland could soon emerge as the most expensive country for consumer goods in the eurozone. The report showed that Ireland was now the second most expensive of the 15 EU member states, while it was fifth from the bottom in 1999. It is markedly more expensive compared with Greece, Spain and Portugal. The report also showed that Ireland was the most expensive of the eurozone countries for food and for prices in pubs and restaurants, as well as being the second most expensive for off-licence alcohol and for recreational culture. VAT rates in hotels, which increased by 1% this year, are the second highest in the eurozone after Germany. There was an expectation that the rate would be reduced in 2002. In its pre-budget submission, the Irish Hotels Federation sought a decrease to 10% but the call was in vain.Ireland's excise duty and VAT on wine is by far the highest in the eurozone, with Spain and Portugal being the lowest. In some countries no excise duty is applied to wine. The tourism industry has been accused of over-pricing but such occurrences are rare. This year, for example, there were discounts across the spectrum and there has never been better value on the domestic front. One Killarney hotel, which normally charges €200 per night, had cut its prices by half and such reductions occurred across the hotel industry. However, Government taxes and local charges are forcing up prices for the tourism industry. I thought these would be addressed in the budget but they have not been.Taking excise duty and VAT into account and considering the spiralling insurance costs, which according to the Small Firms Association's survey have increased on average by 52%, many companies have experienced increases of over 300%. Energy costs have increased by 21% in the past 18 months. Water charges in County Kerry have risen by approximately 20% and refuse charges by 50%. In addition, business rates will be increasing by at least 7% to 10% this year. All these increased charges are making it impossible for our tourism industry to compete so there will be casualties.Local councils are underfunded and the local government fund is inadequate to meet the various impositions that are being placed upon councils. Local authorities are not being funded in terms of new responsibilities. The local government fund is not adequate for County Kerry where the rate base is mostly dependent on the tourism industry, which is being fleeced and forced out of business. Most of the county's business is concentrated in the three local authority areas of Listowel, Tralee and Killarney. There is a very weak rate base in the county and the only ratepayers are in the tourism sector. Tourism is losing its competitiveness as a result vis-à-vis the strengthening of the euro against the dollar and sterling. Next year will be a very difficult one for the tourism sector.

I thank the Minister for Finance for doing that because it will provide a great boost to the town. I was very much involved in the campaign for decentralisation.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on the budget and decentralisation, in particular, which has been a major issue since I became a Member of the House. During the by-election in which I was first elected, it was a major issue for towns in the constituency. One of the measures I had hoped would be introduced in my time as a Member of this House was a decent decentralisation programme. There was strong lobbying for that by representatives from various towns throughout the country, and I compliment the Government on the brave step it took in yesterday's budget. It is long overdue, badly needed and will have an enormous impact on the towns that did not benefit from the Celtic tiger and did not develop as rapidly as Dublin. Moving our public service out of Dublin is to be welcomed. For too long we developed the eastern region but problems were created as a result of that development. Decentralisation will not only benefit the towns involved but also the broader areas around them. It will give the towns a major facelift.Tipperary town, which saw many closures, will get 200 jobs as a result of decentralisation. It was hugely dependent on agriculture in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s but failed to adjust to the changes in the agriculture sector. That was proved by a survey which indicated that Tipperary town was the second poorest in the country. The jubilation in Tipperary town when it got the news that it would benefit from decentralisation was something I had never witnessed previously. Tipperary often won All-Ireland finals and there was great joy in the town as a result but there was as much joy in the town as a result of the announcement yesterday. On behalf of the people of Tipperary I welcome the decision to decentralise a Department to the town.The other town which engaged in strong lobbying for decentralisation is Carrick-on-Suir. It fought a tough battle and it is very disappointed to lose out on this occasion. I note at the end of the list that there are some other jobs to be created in the future and I ask that Carrick-on-Suir be re-examined with a view to that. I know there is considerable sympathy within the Government for the case of Carrick-on-Suir.I welcome the thrust of the decentralisation programme which I believe will have enormous benefit for future generations. I hope the concerns expressed by previous speakers do not come to fruition. We need to drive on this programme. It is easy to announce a plan which looks great on paper but we need to make it happen. Quarterly reports should be laid before this House over the coming years outlining the progress being made. Plans for other areas were announced in the past, including school building and hospital programmes etc., but they did not materialise. While I welcome this announcement and see the enormous benefit it will have, we need to move it forward.The increase in excise duty on diesel is a harsh decision, particularly for those people who use road transport. The Irish Road Haulage Association has long expressed the belief that many of its members are under extreme financial pressure because of the high cost of insurance and other high costs incurred in their business. They were affected by being held up trying to get through certain towns which were not bypassed, and they found their businesses in difficulty. I was disappointed an extra cost was put on those people.The question of job losses in the agri-sector was not properly addressed yesterday. The new decoupling payments scheme that was announced will have a major impact on rural towns. The announcement that some jobs in Dairygold in Mitchelstown will be shed is a trend that will be experienced elsewhere in employment in the agricultural sector. It is now time to plan to maintain jobs in the sector. An assessment of the agriculture industry should be made to ascertain if there is potential for job creation.I was amazed that additional funding was not allocated to the health sector. A new wing costing millions of euro was added to the local hospital in Clonmel but it has not been opened. Public representatives, including myself, have lobbied the Minister in this regard and I am surprised some announcement is not forthcoming regarding Clonmel hospital. As is the position in many other cases, this new wing has not been opened because the necessary resources are not available. I want answers to questions that have been asked in that regard and I request that this wing be opened as soon as possible.I would like to know what the Government has against young people building their own homes given that there appears to be no encouragement to help them do so. Local authority charges are increasing. As can be seen from the recent Estimates, new charges are being introduced in local authority areas. The reintroduction of the first-time buyer's grant should have been considered. People earning low wages find it impossible to build their own houses and more people will go on to local authority housing waiting lists as a result. I urge the Government to consider some way of helping those people in the future because everyone aspires to owning their own home, yet there was no help for such people in the budget.I heard the Minister for Education and Science say this morning that it was a great day for education. I hope he is right and that he publishes the list of the schools that will be developed next year as a result of the budget. We need more openness and transparency and fewer political promises. A decent schools building programme needs to be put in place.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	439	This is a good, balanced and inclusive budget. It promotes the sustainable development of the country in terms of employment, economic growth and the provision of new environmental and other infrastructure. It also respects the need for prudence in the management of our public finances as well as maintaining competitiveness. These policies will create the environment within which we can meet our commitments on social inclusion.I want to focus on two issues which are especially relevant to my portfolio as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. These are the national spatial strategy and local government finances. The national spatial strategy was agreed by the Government just a year ago as a 20 year planning framework for achieving balanced regional development. With the support of a spatial plan, we are focused on creating scale and critical mass at strategic regional locations, which will, in turn, be extended to wider areas. In doing so, all areas of the country will be allowed to grow to their potential.The budget provisions on decentralisation demonstrate that the Government has a real and practical commitment to the regional policy agenda. The thrust of the decentralisation proposals is aimed at making a significant and well planned contribution to the objectives of the NSS. In addition to the public sector jobs which decentralisation will bring to different locations, the programme will also help to build investor confidence in regions. I am confident that the Government's leadership on decentralisation will encourage the private sector to follow. It should generate wider enterprise and business activity and attract further inward investment and employment to the regions.In adopting priorities for decentralisation closely aligned with those of the national spatial strategy, the Government has optimised its potential role in achieving more balanced regional development. A striking example is the way in which the decentralisation programme will provide a good platform for the development of the new linked gateway of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore in the midlands. This vote of confidence will help to reinforce critical mass in the region and underpin its potential to support indigenous growth and attract investment.Decentralisation's focus on gateways such as Limerick-Shannon, Sligo and Waterford and the nearby hubs of Wexford and Kilkenny will help to build their national scale and role and strengthen their ability to complement the scale of economic success already evident in Dublin. With six of the hubs identified under the national spatial strategy benefiting from the decentralisation proposals announced today and two of the remainder already having decentralised offices, the hubs are offered the opportunity to build on the key role envisaged from them under the strategy.From a spatial perspective, there is much to be gained from the planned clustering of public service activities to promote ease of access and mutual co-operation. This will facilitate the more efficient and effective delivery of services with the support, for example, of shared facilities. Clustering also provides wider pools of talent from which promotional opportunities can be filled and a greater range of employment possibilities for partners and spouses.The national spatial strategy and the decentralisation programme announced yesterday are also good for Dublin. The dynamic new urban and rural spatial structure to be developed fully over the next 20 years, to which decentralisation will make a significant contribution, will enable Dublin to play to its strengths as a strong, internationally competitive city region, driving both its economy and national development. It will enhance the economic and social potential of all regions and create the conditions under which more balanced development can be increasingly realised. This will ease the pressures on Dublin and facilitate solutions to its problems in areas such as transport and housing supply.My participation, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the Cabinet committee which will drive decentralisation, demonstrates the Government's will and intent to align the implementation process with national spatial strategy requirements. In addition to the decentralisation programme, the Government has introduced a wide range of measures at national, regional and local level to implement the national spatial strategy. At national level, I am leading the process of embedding the strategy into the policies, programmes and activities of Government Departments and agencies. This will assist in ensuring that the strategy directs the spatial aspects of public sector programme, including the determination of investment priorities.At regional level, regional authorities, working in conjunction with their constituent local authorities, are making good progress in developing regional planning guidelines to roll out the national spatial strategy in more detail. The guidelines which will emerge from this process are expected to be in place in all regions by the spring of next year.At local level, planning authorities are putting in place local development frameworks and plans at the gateway and hub level. This will support a critical mass of development at strategic locations. Work on preparation of the development frameworks is well advanced in most of the gateways and hubs identified in the strategy. Other initiatives are under way to support the development of these centres as they expand to take on the regional development role envisaged for them under the national spatial strategy. The Cork area strategic plan, the Waterford planning land use and transportation study and the Riverside City initiative in Limerick are some examples.The overall approach taken by the Government to decentralisation will strengthen the regional urban system and help to build up the investment and employment base of many strategically placed towns and the areas they influence. Decentralisation is a catalyst in supporting the process of growth which needs to be sustained in these towns.The Government established a funding system for local authorities in 1999. It is beyond question that local government has gained from the new arrangements. In 2003, record general purpose allocations of more than €626 million were made available to local authorities from the local government fund. These grants have been increased by approximately 85% since the Government came into office in 1997, a significant achievement by any standards.In 2004, local authorities face increasing expenditure demands on a range of fronts, including wage and salary increases arising from benchmarking, parallel benchmarking and Sustaining Progress. The recently published Book of Estimates showed that additional spending capacity of €38 million would be available in the local government fund in 2004 to assist local authorities in meeting these challenges. In the current budgetary context, €38 million represents a significant contribution to local government, equivalent to an increase of 6% on the current year in general purpose local government fund grants.At the time, I indicated I was examining a range of other options to boost income to the fund even further. The outcome is the additional €30 million for the local government fund announced yesterday, which I am sure the House will join me in welcoming. This is an excellent result for local government. It underlines our commitments to fund local authorities, provide the resources necessary to allow local councils to maintain and deepen the range and quality of services to the public, and keep local government at the centre of the political agenda.The additional €30 million will bring local government fund resources in 2004 to well over €1.2 billion. I anticipate that general purpose grants from the local government fund to local authorities in 2004 will increase by a minimum of 11% compared to 2003. Further specific purpose grant allocations will also be made to most major local authorities. I am satisfied these increases in local government fund grants will make an appropriate and fair contribution to meeting the increased costs of local authorities, including staffing costs, in 2004. They will also avoid the need for any undue increases in rates, fees and other local charges next year. I will announce details of allocations to local authorities in the coming days.The local government sector has been subject to a rigorous and systematic verification process in line with Sustaining Progress. The report from the performance verification group, which my Department should receive next week, will highlight a range of customer service, IT and efficiency innovations taking place among local authorities. It is correct in current circumstances that the bar should be set high for local authorities in terms of improving value for money, customer service and, importantly, productivity. The verification process will continue to challenge local authorities with regard to this requirement of high performance now and for the future.The time available does not permit me to make more than a passing reference to the other features of the budget which bear directly on the programmes for which I am responsible. Extension of the termination deadlines for the tax-based urban and town renewal schemes should ensure vital investment is not lost where unexpected delays have slowed progress on the relevant projects. In this way, the schemes should be able to realise fully the investment of €3.6 billion projected for them.The capital envelopes initiative will bring more certainty to the financing of multi-annual programmes and more flexibility in the carry-over of funding from one year to the next. With an overall investment envelope of almost €34 billion in the five year period to 2008, our infrastructural deficit will continue to be redressed in a planned and systematic manner.This budget is good for economic prosperity, employment and social inclusion, which will be delivered in a balanced manner in order that all our regions, as well as our urban centres and their rural hinterlands, will benefit. It provides a coherent framework for continued economic and social progress and I commend it to the House.

Is mór an méid é sin do na daoine sin.Is aisteach go mbíonn scaiftí a rá nach bhfuil an Rialtas seo ar an eite chlé mar, má bhreatnaíonn duine ar chúrsaí mar atá siad, tá os cionn dhá thrian de chaiteachtas go léir ag dul ar chúrsaí leighis, oideachais agus leasa shóisialaí.Inné freisin, rinneadh rud fíor-thábhachtach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, rud beag ach rud a chuideoidh go mór leis na mná tí ar fad a choinníonn an 24,000 scolairí a thagann go dtí an Gaeltacht chuile bhliain. Bhí na Coimisinéirí Ioncam ag cur in iúl do na mná tí agus d'eagraíochtaí na gColáistí Gaeilge go gcaithfidís cuntaisí iomlán a choinneáil ar ioncam ó scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge sna blianta atá romhainn. Níorbh é méid an cháin ioncaim a bhí ag cur as do na mná tí ach chomh deacair agus bheadh sé cuntaisí iomlána a choinneáil, idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir costasaí an tí agus costasaí coinneáil na ngasúr. Bhí go leor acu a rá nach bhfeilfeadh sé iad, de bharr na hoibre agus na costasaí arda cuntasaíochta a bhainfeadh leis, leanúint leis an scéim.Inné d'fhógair an tAire, ag leanúint an líne a thosaigh le cinneadh a thóg an tAire Airgeadais nuair a bhí mé i mo Sheanadóir, go dtabharfaidh faoiseamh iomlán cánach do na mná tí a choinníonn na Gaeilgeoirí. Ní amháin gur buntáiste sin do na mná tí sin, ach buntáiste mór a bheidh ann sa mhéid is go bhfásfaidh na coláistí do na mílte gasúr a thagann chuile bhliain ó cheithre hairde na hÉireann chun na Gaeltachta le Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus le blás a fháil ar shaol éagsúil. Ba rud maith don nGaeltacht agus do phobal na tíre frí chéile é. Cuireadh ceist orm ar maidin faoi seo agus dúradh liom go raibh sé mar fhabhar do phobal na Gaeltachta. Níl náire orm a raibh gur rud maith é cúnamh a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Tá scéim faoiseamh cánach eile, an rent a room allowance, a bhaintear an-úsáid as sna cathracha atá an-chosúil leis an rud atá déanta anois.Yesterday was an important day for rural Ireland. As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I welcome the Government's decision to proceed with the most radical decentralisation programme ever. There will be State offices in every county in Ireland. If young people want to join the public service, they will be able to get a job in their own region. The decision to spread the public service throughout the country will not only aid and balance rural spatial development, but it will also ensure that the Government's perspective is based on a public service, particularly at the top level, whose views reflect what is happening throughout the State rather than just in Dublin. That will bring a divergence and richness to the thought processes of Government, which will benefit everyone.As someone who comes from this city, I know that the tragedy of the past 30 or 40 years has been that the growth of the city has far exceeded its capacity, both socially and infrastructurally, to deal with it. Time and again politicians have rightly said it has been a major injustice to build huge housing estates without providing the social and physical infrastructure simultaneously. I hope decentralisation means that the city will get a chance to catch up with itself in terms of providing the necessary infrastructure. Infrastructure should usually remain good for 20 or 30 years. We are in a good position in that the major investment in infrastructure in the west means we can look forward to absorbing any new growth without destroying people's lives.I was pleased today to receive an e-mail from a school in County Mayo which had made a plea that its numbers were down. The decision to locate my Department and another Department in County Mayo is welcome because it will boost the numbers in that parish. It will allow young people in that parish to get public service jobs in their county. That, in turn, will create more growth which will mean that the schools which are operating under capacity and looking for pupils, and the other institutions of rural parishes, will be maintained.It is a radical move. There are issues which must be dealt with, but I do not have any doubt that if we work together and on a voluntary basis we will complete the programme within the three years. As one of the Ministers involved, I will immediately set in train the steps to ensure it is implemented.I am pleased the Minister for Finance has agreed to make the finance available for the rural social scheme. Many people will argue this is community employment in another guise. However, people living in rural areas treated community employment as a different type of scheme. We all know the reality was different from people's perception. Community employment is and will continue to be a labour force intervention. Its purpose is to provide training and permanent jobs for people who are long-term unemployed. However, that was not the case for many small farmers. Although they were great participants in the community employment scheme, it was not designed for their requirements. They were not looking for training to get a full-time job because they already had a job, but for supplementary employment and income in their parishes so their farming enterprises could become viable. As a result of changes in world farming, many farms which were viable 30 or 40 years ago are not viable any longer. Farm assist is a help, but all means-tested payments come at a price. It is beneficial and important that people have an extra fixed income as well as the social interaction associated with employment, particularly with modern farming practices.As the CE scheme is a labour force intervention, there is a cap on the number of years a person can avail of it. As the rural social scheme is not a labour force intervention but a means of providing local farmers, who need income support, with work and incomes and of providing services in local communities, there will not be a cap on the total number of years a person can avail of it. If there are more applicants than places on the scheme, those longest on it will leave it for a duration and those seeking to avail of it will be accommodated. However, the following year those who were laid off the scheme will be able to reapply and since they will be the new entrants, they will be able to avail of it as the revolving system means that those longest on it must leave. If there is a big demand for the scheme and enough places are not available, there will be periodic lay-offs.I have experience in this area and I know this will be a major step forward on two grounds. First, one can continue to avail of the scheme during one's lifetime in farming. Second, the community groups organising the scheme will be able to maintain a motivated workforce which will provide essential services in their communities. The scheme is about service provision, such as meals on wheels, day care services for the elderly, the tidy town and village enhancement schemes and the maintenance required in community and sports facilities. It will have the added advantage of longer continuity in terms of the labour force than heretofore. The farmers who should not have been on the CE scheme, as it was not designed for them, will now move to the new scheme and that will free up places on the CE scheme at urban and rural level for those for whom it was designed, namely, people who are looking for training to get into the workforce.We will achieve an aim I set out in the detailed agricultural policy document, which I wrote on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the last election, in the party's manifesto and in the programme for Government. The programmes I outlined will be brought into force. I am pleased that such progress has been made for rural Ireland. I could say many more about the budget if I had more time.Molaim cáinaisnéis an lae inné. Thug sé aire faoi leith ó thaobh an chórais chánach d'fheirmeoirí agus do na daoine eile atá ar ioncam íseal.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget for 2004. There are a number of issues that I want to address, but first among them is the radical decision of the Government to decentralise Departments from Dublin to the regions. In my part of Cork North-West, Kanturk, it was received with joy and jubilation. The decision on decentralisation means the most to small places like Kanturk and other small, rural provincial towns. A lot of the major centres of population throughout Ireland, and the larger towns, have industry and are situated strategically. However, Kanturk had a difficulty in acquiring industry for many years. It was an old market town where the decline of traditional industries led to the decline of the town. In 2000, the town renewal scheme was established, which helped, but the announcement by the Minister for Finance that 100 jobs are coming to Kanturk is extremely important to the region.I am delighted this has come to pass, as before I contested the 1997 general election it was one of the main planks of my campaign that if I was elected I would do what I could to secure a Department, or part thereof, for the constituents of Cork North-West. That was contained in a press release issued on 17 February 1997. Many people said over the previous five to six years that it was a pipe dream and nonsense.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	445	In an article in last Thursday's edition of the local newspaper, The Corkman, Opposition Deputies stated there was no commitment from the Government on decentralisation for Kanturk, County Cork. They even added that after putting down a question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the prospect of decentralisation was far away. In my election literature in 2002, I said I would do everything possible to secure decentralisation for the area.I am delighted the Government has committed itself to decentralisation for Kanturk. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and many other Ministers have been bombarded occasionally on this issue by our people in Kanturk.When the announcement was made in December 1999, a group of us got together in February 2000, on behalf of Kanturk, to submit a proposal to the Department of Finance. We went through the various details and information the Department of Finance required to allow us to put the case for Kanturk in terms of educational facilities, etc.I have been interested in some of the comments from the other side of the House since the decentralisation programme was announced. Some Deputies said it would be impossible to run a decentralised Department and to have the heads of Departments outside the Dublin area. They said it would not be possible for them to function properly. This is a farce. We are a small country, not global, we can work as easily from Kanturk as we can from Kildare Street.Some of the issues have been addressed. Over the last six or seven years, I have interacted with the public service and Civil Service as a Member of Dáil Eireann, and I found a lot of people had come from the regions to Dublin as civil servants. They joined the Civil Service at a young age and settled in Dublin because of the State jobs that were provided. There are a lot of people, particularly from my region, not alone from Kanturk but my home village of Kiskeam, that left their area to move to Dublin for a job. The opportunity will now be given to those people to pursue a career in the public service or Civil Service in rural Ireland without the drawbacks of the mad rush which is part of life in the capital. It is great news that people will not have to go to the capital for State jobs.The decentralisation programmes which have taken place previously have worked well, including the moves to Ballina and moving the primary sector headquarters of the Department of Education and Science to Tullamore. I look forward to the new scheme.The Government announced in 1999 that decentralisation would take place. It has now been announced only to be treated with scepticism by Opposition Members. They question when it will happen and when the blocks will be laid. They want to know when the buildings are going to be opened. We could not lay the foundations or open the buildings until we made the decision to do it. The Government is to be commended for doing this and making the announcement in the first place. It was a tough political decision. Some people have called it a political gamble before the local elections and suggested we were afraid to do it prior to this. However, in the few minutes that remain to me, I welcome the decision by the Government and compliment and thank the Ministers who met us at the far end of the country when we were lobbying for the Kanturk and Duhallow area. It is fantastic news for Kanturk and was greeted with great emotion last night. I am delighted that my political pledge in 2002 and 1997 has been honoured.The new jobs initiative, especially the social economy jobs for small farmers, is excellent. For one reason or another they have fallen outside the CE scheme. This allows small farmers to get a legitimate job and supplement their income. There are great pressures on small farmers with agriculture in decline and the need for a critical mass of agriculture in the future. This is a new initiative which is innovative and will produce positive benefits for people on farm assistance and other social welfare payments.On the extension of the town renewal scheme, I am aware that the scheme was due to end on 31 January 2004. I welcome the Minister's decision to extend it until 31 July 2006. This will be welcomed in each of the 100 towns across Ireland that benefited from the town renewal scheme. In the early days of the town renewal scheme, especially in Kanturk and Charleville, very little advantage was taken of the scheme in the first year or two. From what we know at this stage, according to the county council which is issuing the primary certificate, there is substantial growth in the numbers taking advantage of the scheme.I am delighted to be given the opportunity to speak on the budget which has so many good things in it. This budget will be known as the decentralisation budget as it is innovative.

I commend the Government for this initiative.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I will be sharing my time with Deputies Shortall and Wall.I am glad Deputy Moynihan admits it was a decentralisation budget. It is good to hear someone being truthful, as it was certainly not a budget for poor people or those on the margins.Amid the euphoria over decentralisation, I made a speech yesterday in which I said there was no consideration of the thousands of social welfare recipients who were hammered by the savage 16 cuts. I would not expect the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to refer to them as he was the author of the "dirty dozen". There is a link between them.In 1999 I brought a motion to Westmeath County Council asking for a comprehensive and integrated submission on decentralisation from Mullingar Town Council, Westmeath County Council, the chamber of commerce, the local trades council, the county enterprise board and the local development groups. Mullingar is ideally suited to and strategically located for decentralisation and is the only midlands town that was never favoured before, despite its excellent infrastructural and recreational facilities, good opportunities, good educational establishments and many other positive points. I have no doubt people will enjoy their time in Mullingar and they will be very welcome. We will have places to which they can come and we hope it happens within the three year period.Unfortunately, yesterday evening the reality of life for 116 employees of Penn Racquet Sports Limited, which has manufactured tennis balls since 1974, took a downward turn. Facing into Christmas, they were told they were being made redundant. It has tempered the excitement in Mullingar, but that is how life goes on. We must bear these important issues in mind.While half the speech of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was devoted to decentralisation, there was not a single mention of the social welfare cuts. This was despite the outcry of more than a dozen voluntary and charitable organisations such as OPEN, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and the Simon Community, which condemned the cuts. The Minister could not even bring herself to respond to these concerns about yesterday's budget. I resent the Minister's remark that the Opposition sees those in need of social support as political playthings. I come from that background myself – I was the eldest of ten in a county council house with no water and an outdoor toilet. I remember when two or three pints of milk were given to families when children were born as an important addition to the family budget. I speak about these matters with passion because I have experience of them.Although some people have spent their lives in cocoons, I have never forgotten what it was like to see my parents struggling to scrape a living. I remember when my family depended on my father's wage of £3 a week. I am not here to make political capital out of anyone's misfortune and I deeply resent the Minister's remarks. I have never used people for political capital. I said in the House that I was prepared to pay the extra 1 cent in the euro if that was what it took to undo the €58 million in cuts. Socialism is about solidarity, fraternity and a sense of community. It is about remembering where one comes from in order to get somewhere, being prepared to give rather than take and promoting the idea of "us"rather than "me", which is the opposite of the policy practised by the Tories in the UK and which nearly brought the country to its knees.I am here to effect change, not as a personal crusade but as the Labour Party representative. I come from a proud party which was founded in 1912. We believe in this. If we must have a tax and spend policy, let us spend on the poor, the marginalised and the 5,000 or 6,000 people who are homeless across the country tonight. There is no shame in articulating their vision and their concerns in the Chamber. That is what I am here for and no snide comments will put me off that track.These criticisms of yesterday's budget did not come from me. The renowned writer Justine McCarthy said the 16 cutbacks, when viewed with earlier decisions such as the cutback in the job initiative and CE schemes, were ringing alarm bells about the Government's fiscal policy. When the Minister talks about capping rent supplements the issue of abuse of the system is always skirted around, yet when we ask questions no one can name any particular abuse. Would it not be more logical to cap the rent charged by landlords? If we want a proper social policy this is what we should do. Landlords already have great property rights. Why, for the common good, should we not ensure they charge reasonable rent? That is how we could achieve a change in social policy. If I had a place to rent I would not pass bitter remarks about this.Various organisations have made remarks about the cutbacks in the area of social welfare. OPEN, representing lone parent groups, said: "The Government clearly believes that it is now acceptable to further marginalise one-parent families despite their continuing poverty and a major housing crisis."  The Simon Community said the cuts were "a backward step" and that they "will lead to greater hardship for those trying to establish themselves in the private rented housing market."  Professor John Monaghan, the vice president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, said: "It makes a nonsense of any argument from the Government that they are serious about tackling child poverty."  Ray Dooley of the Children's Rights Alliance said the measures "will exacerbate the overwhelming vulnerability of children in [one] parent families to poverty."  Patrick Burke, director of Threshold, said: "Without this [rent] allowance people who leave home in a crisis situation may have no other choice than to become homeless."  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed says the cuts are "an attack on unemployed people."  Tony Walsh of SIPTU said: "The Government should rethink its proposals and avoid creating further poverty traps with all of the consequential social issues that flow from them," and Pat Bolger, vice-chairman of IMPACT's community welfare officers' group, said: "The Minister is pulling away the social safety net from thousands of social welfare recipients and their children."  I did not write these comments which were made by people who are in the know.Last week, as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I published, along with my colleagues of all parties, the report of the committee on the position of full-time carers. It contained a number of proposals such as the abolition of the means test and a move to home care subvention. I am not a fool, however. To prove that I do not take political advantage, I even admitted that some of our aims could not be achieved. I received 500% support from everybody, however, when I said that where persons who provide care are recipients of widow's pension or social welfare payments, 50% of the carer's allowance should be paid. We should cut through the nonsense and ensure that people who are receiving social welfare payments and caring for somebody, who may be an adult of 36 or a child with Down's syndrome, receive some portion of the allowance as recognition for saving the State many millions of euro. The top 400 earners in this country are receiving property capital development allowances worth €70 million, yet the Government took €58 million from the social welfare budget.

What about the tax exiles, the bed and breakfast people who arrive and leave without paying any tax? These are the shelters we should be considering. We should have equity and fairness in the system and I am prepared to pay more to achieve this. Those who are in a position to pay more should do so – they should ensure that the people at the bottom are protected. I am not making this up. If the Minister of State wants to rubbish the Community Platform, which consists of 26 organisations, that is his prerogative, but I will not do so. Those people are at the coalface. They know what is happening and they are talking about it.On the matter of restrictions on rent supplements, sending clients to local authorities for assessment will result in the local authority housing list being swamped. Clients other than single people are already referred to the local authority. Single people, particularly single males, do not receive any priority on the housing list.

The need for rent supplements has been independently established. In any event it is already the practice, backed up by legislation, not to pay supplement to those leaving local authority housing. Those issues are important. The crèche supplement about which the Minister spoke today is not being cut, it is being reformed. Dietary supplements are another area of concern. Thankfully, as anyone who looks at me can see I am healthy and can eat everything.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am not shy at the table. I saw the days when rabbit was part of the staple diet, and good food as well. I am not ashamed to admit that either. I only learned recently about the cost of food supplements for people on a gluten-free diet. There are two doctors in the House who know their business much better than I do. It costs around €4.90 a loaf. The ordinary loaf is about €1.35. This is important in that context. The sum involved is not large. Perhaps all these matters need reform and should be examined. However, a supplement should not be taken away until every option is examined. The problem about this is there is no joined-up government, to use the buzz phrase one hears across the water to which I do not pay much attention. The Minister says she is not a housing authority and one accepts that. However, it is important that the local authorities, the health boards, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government all come together and say where all those people fit in.The Minister stated that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as her own Department and the health boards are coming together as regards crèche supplements. Crèche payments are normally made on behalf of children aged two and a half to four years for pre-school for a few hours every morning. They are generally paid on the basis of social need or whatever. This is of incalculable benefit to the children and their parents. I see the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, in the House. I know he is dealing with the other end of the scale, but this issue could properly come within the remit of health or education. I am not here to bury my head in the sand. If there are practical solutions, let us find them. The saving from this measure is the penurious sum of €1.5 million.The committee recommended that where a person gives up a job to provide care, the 15 month restriction on the payment of carer's benefit should be waived while he or she continues to provide care. That would not cost a fortune. I know that €150 million to €200 million to abolish the means test is big money, so this should be done over a period of time. The report reflects a cross-party view on this issue. It might not be the best but it was written by the committee without the aid of consultants. There was a fair degree of consensus and recognition of the problems.It is great to see the respite care grant increased, but Deputy Callely should persuade the relevant Department to pay the €800 to the widow or widower who is look after someone for 52 weeks of the year. I know the Minister of State appreciates what is involved here. People in that situation should be able to buy a bit of respite care and have a break. This is absolutely essential and is the badge of a caring compassionate society. It has not happened yet although I hope the Government will make an announcement in this regard.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	465	On the exclusion of spouses from the supplementary welfare allowance, this will have a significant effect on families in the small number of cases where it is used. An example would be a family with three children renting a house where the husband is in low-paid employment, earning approximately €300 per week. If the wife applies for supplementary welfare they could receive rent supplement and the household would have €317 a week. If this is withdrawn, the husband has no option but to go back on the welfare. Such poverty traps are being created and it is important to ensure as changes are made that a trap is not left behind for somebody. Some 8% of all children live in households where the income is below 60% of the average industrial wage. The €6 increase in child benefit is welcome. I recall the time when a first child in a family was worth half the second child. However, there is no increase in the child dependant allowance, no medical cards for children and no mention of the Government's proposal to bring in 200,000 medical cards as a safety net for people on low incomes. I will have much more to say on this next week.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I want to respond to the comments made by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, this evening. He spent his time singing his own praises for having secured 2,500 places on the new rural community scheme. I give him credit for doing that and it is a welcome development. This new scheme will go some way towards making up for the loss of 10,000 community employment scheme jobs over the past couple of years. However, I would remind Deputy Ó Cuív of his responsibility for urban as well as rural communities. It is about time he honoured those responsibilities. To date, he has utterly failed those communities in urban Ireland that have been most ravaged by the drugs problem, the 13 drugs task force areas that are among the poorest in the country. He has done little or nothing for them since he became Minister.I would remind him in particular about his obligations to fund the drugs task force programmes, which he has failed to do. He has left the drugs task force hanging on, waiting for funding for its programmes. He has completely failed to come up with the promised second round of funding for youth facilities in those areas in which they are so badly needed. These are areas with a high incidence of drug abuse where large numbers drop out of school early and where little or nothing is provided in terms of facilities. The Minister has completely failed those people and promised funding has not materialised.He has also utterly failed in the RAPID programme. A previous Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, Deputy Eoin Ryan, promised €2 million in transfers to areas most in need. People's hopes were built up. The money was provided to draw up the plans and employ co-ordinators. These people were brought up the mountain and now their hopes have been dashed by being told that no money is available for the RAPID programme. It is all very well to boast about a small initiative in rural Ireland, but the Minister has completely and utterly failed the poorest communities in our cities. He must remember that he has responsibility in this area. He has been a disaster to date in that regard.I want to address one of the savage 16 cuts, referred to by Deputy Penrose. One of the most savage and cruellest initiatives was the cut in the crèche supplement. It affects three day nurseries in my constituency, two in Ballymun and one in Finglas south. Deputy Callely will be aware of these day nurseries that are part-funded by the health board, one of which is located in Kilbarrack in his own constituency. Those day nurseries provide pre-school services for the most disadvantaged children in this country. The two nurseries in Ballymun cater for children of single-parent families which are totally dependent on social welfare. They live in areas of serious disadvantage, with poor health status in the community. There are poor community supports. These children are referred to day nurseries by public health nurses or the Mater child guidance clinic. They are referred for educational, social and medical intervention at two to three years of age because of concerns for their future welfare.Some 70% of children in Ballymun have left the education system before taking the leaving certificate. It is a terrible indictment of the Government that this is happening in 2003. Last year, fewer than 1% of children in Ballymun took up third level education. If this does not make the case for serious pre-school intervention, nothing will. Through the great efforts of local people, including a number of religious, day nurseries were established to provide early education intervention for children who are most at risk. They are part-funded by the health board but their existence is entirely dependent on a small crèche supplement from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is a tiny payment which has enabled these children and their parents to avail of the service and enable it to continue.The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, who pretends to be such a caring Minister, could not give a damn about the effect of her cuts on these children who attend health board day nurseries. She has taken away that supplement and jeopardised these children's future and the future of the services. When she and Deputy Carey were put under pressure about this savage cut, they said they would approach the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see what could be done. No money is available from that Minister. He is too busy providing grant aid for crèches in areas where the money is not exactly needed to support industry.

Some €7 billion has been allocated for roads over the next five years. There is no point providing large sums of money for road projects unless serious steps are taken to ensure we get value for money. The ESRI mid-term review of spending on roads for the first half of the national development plan showed serious difficulties in project management. We built fewer roads for more money, which cannot be allowed to continue. There is a serious problem with project management and the type of contracts in use. Announcing funding is one thing but ensuring taxpayers get value for money is a different matter. There is an onus on the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to introduce a new type of fixed-cost contract which will ensure we get value for money.

Just one third of the amount spent on roads is spent on public transport. Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce said that traffic congestion in the Dublin area is costing the business community €3 billion. Unless we get this right and the Minister ensures there is a greater allocation of money for public transport, the city will come to a standstill.

Some of these people whom I see in my surgery are waiting to get on the official waiting list, which the Government said would be eliminated in 155 days. I will not hold my breath.The Minister increased the price of cigarettes by just 25 cent, which is a terrible indictment of the Government. International research indicates that, if the price of cigarettes is increased, people will cut down on smoking. The Government will take the shilling rather than take the health of the nation into consideration. This exposes its hypocrisy about the smoking ban, with which I agree. It is a bit of a smokescreen for the inequality that exists in the health service. We will soon be grading hospitals by trolley capacity rather than bed capacity. The Government believed that, if it increased the price of cigarettes, people would no longer buy them, which would have been a good thing from my point of view but apparently not so from the Government's point of view.Given that the Government did not increase the price of alcohol, it is no wonder we have an alcohol problem. The Tánaiste said she would not like the drinks industry to receive less revenue. I do not agree with this. It is unacceptable that the Government did not help the problem by increasing excise duty on alcohol.There are many reports on the health service. However, what is needed is proper funding, not reports. While 3,000 beds were promised, not even half the number promised in the first year were provided. Funding is not provided for this in the budget. The manager of Mayo General Hospital was on radio asking people not to go to the hospital because of overcrowding and the crisis there. What was once a winter crisis is now a year long crisis but the budget does nothing to solve the problem.There are fewer people than ever on medical cards. The figure of 37.5% in 1988 was reduced to 29.4% in 2002, which included the rich people over the age of 70. It is not acceptable that 200,000 people on the breadline should be without a medical card.There is no reference to community employment schemes or a special category for people who cannot get employment. These people, who took part in CE schemes because of their chronic disability, will not be helped by the budget.On housing, where is the defined revenue funding scheme to allow communities build more houses and support people in their own communities? There are local authority and Western Health Board schemes to repair housing. There is €15 million for Punchestown and much more for horseracing prizes and so on, but where is the funding for people?Today, the Select Committee on Health and Children dealt with the Supplementary Estimate. The Minister requested €10 million for legal expenses in respect of the Lindsay tribunal. It would have been much better had the Government given the money to the haemophiliacs who deserve it rather than giving senior counsel €2,500 and junior counsel €1,400 for a morning's work, which is scandalous and a terrible waste of money.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I wish to share my time with Deputies Brendan Smith, Devins and Callanan.Before proceeding to the main point of my speech I wish to concentrate on issues in the budget in terms of disability and other provisions. I cannot let go Deputy Shortall's comments on the crèche supplement. There is a gross distortion of the position of child care funding. Some years ago the Government took a clear decision to identify the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as the key Department for the allocation of funding for child care projects across the country. That was done in accordance with a national plan which involved county committees of child care and a logical progression and development of child care facilities in every parish and community. Hundreds of millions of euro have been spent since then on child care facilities.The charge Deputy Shortall made that there is nobody in charge of child care policy is false and demonstrably untrue. What has happened in this case, from what I can observe, is that a particular supplement which was introduced for the purpose of providing assistance to the parents of children in need of short-term emergency support, in certain areas, particularly those mentioned, became mainstreamed as permanent funding for crèches. That was never the intention of the child crèche supplement.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	479	No, it is inappropriate. People may develop local solutions but that is not the way to proceed. In terms of the provision of a comprehensive child care facility, particularly in areas of disadvantage, funding is available. In my constituency where people made submissions to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, they were assessed by the committee that analyses such submissions and funding was provided. When advising local communities on how crèches should be funded we need to get it right. If ad hoc solutions develop over time they are inadequate when a change is made to a particular scheme which was never meant as mainstream funding for personnel in child care projects. It is wrong to make political propaganda of the position, to distort the reality and go on a political rant about it.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is on record as saying she is in discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and health boards to ensure appropriate alternative measures are put in place. She said today that no crèche will close as a result of the change she has made to crèche supplements, and she should be taken at her word. If we could put the politics to one side and concentrate on alleviating the difficulties parents perceive with the provision of crèche facilities it would be better for everyone.The Abridged Estimates Volume published in November provides a gross total estimate of over €10 billion for the health service, an increase of 10% on the Revised Estimate for 2003. This significant level of funding has been further increased in the budget for 2004, which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced yesterday.I welcome the €26.6 million in additional current expenditure made available by the Minister for Finance in the budget for services for people with disabilities and the increase in health allowances in line with social welfare increases.An additional €18 million will be used to provide additional emergency placements and extra day services, especially for school leavers and to enhance the health related support service for children. I will allocate capital funding for these services from within my 2004 allocation following a review of priorities within the overall capital programme.Since 1997 there has been an unprecedented level of investment in the health-funded support services for people with disabilities. Additional funding amounting to €605 million has been invested in these services. This unprecedented level of additional funding has enabled substantial progress to be made with regard to the development of residential, respite, day, therapy and other support services for people with disabilities.Since 1996 there has been significant growth in the level of provision of full-time residential services, residential support services and day services reported on the national intellectual disability database reflecting, in particular, the significant investment programme in the intellectual disability sector between 2000 and 2002. Key developments noted in the 2002 report include a 37% growth in the number of people with intellectual disability living in full-time residential placements within local communities; a 165% increase in the provision of intensive placements designed to meet the needs of individuals with challenging behaviours; a 47% reduction in the number of people accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; a continued expansion in the availability of residential support services, in particular service-based respite services, which have grown by 255% since 1997, with an additional 443 people reported as being in receipt of these services between 2001 and 2002 alone; and increased provision in almost all areas of adult day services and in the level of other support services delivered as part of a package of day services to both children and adults.We have also funded alternative placements and an enhanced level of services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who were resident in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in May 2003 was 438. This is down from 571 in 2001 and from 970 in 1996. The new accommodation provided includes community-based homes and a number of residential and day complexes.In addition to providing funding for new service developments, we have also made a significant allocation to meet identified needs in existing services. These needs arise as a result of the changing profile of persons with an intellectual disability. An increasing number of older and medically fragile persons are cared for as a result of the provision of funding for residential services. There are also issues such as underfunding of base budgets, including the need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from sources such as fundraising. In the past my Department has sought to address these issues as resources have permitted.A sum of €3 million is being made available for services for those with physical or sensory disabilities to meet priority service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in consultation with other relevant agencies. These service pressures include respite, home supports, services for people with significant disabilities, support services for children with disabilities and the provision of aids and appliances. There are approximately 2,000 people with significant long-term disabilities who require constant nursing care and supports and who are inappropriately placed in nursing homes for older people and acute hospital beds. This funding will enable some of those to be transferred to appropriate settings.A sum of €3 million is being made available towards the alleviation of the under-resourcing of the voluntary sector service providers who are responsible for the provision of a wide range of services to those with physical and sensory disabilities.Historically, many of the existing services provided by voluntary agencies were developed in the absence of publicly funded services. The growth of these services has been demand-led, with finance being provided mainly through voluntary fundraising and section 65 grants from health boards. However, the latter grants have historically resulted in financial difficulties for a number of organisations as their services have grown and their fundraising income has declined, with many of the main service providers incurring ongoing, accumulating deficits.The intermittent financial support from health boards has also led to an uncertain provision of services. In an effort to prevent further core deficits from arising, it is intended that in future, health and personal social services being provided by voluntary sector service providers will be funded under section 26 of the Health Act 1970. In 2003, €8.453 million has been allocated to alleviate the problems of the larger service providers. The allocation of this additional €6 million is further evidence of the Government's commitment to these services and to supporting those with disabilities and their families.Health allowances are being increased in the budget in line with those received by social welfare recipients with effect from January 2004. A total of €4.7 million is being provided for this purpose in 2004, of which €3.1 million was provided in the Estimates published last November.The mental health needs of prisoners have been a particular cause of concern for some time and, on this occasion, €1 million additional revenue funding is being allocated to the Central Mental Hospital to enable it to increase its capacity to admit prisoners with a mental illness. I am pleased to announce that €1 million capital will be made available also to the hospital in 2004 to undertake the necessary refurbishment works to support this initiative.I was pleased to have had the opportunity to visit the Central Mental Hospital in February 2003 and to meet staff and patients there. I was impressed with the work undertaken at the hospital and by the dedication of the staff, who carry out their work in difficult physical conditions.The Central Mental Hospital provides a forensic service for the entire country. It admits patients directly from the courts and from the Prison Service and, to a lesser extent, local mental health services around the country. The physical conditions at the hospital are not satisfactory. Most of the old building is unsuited to its current purpose. Since 1999, €500,000 has been spent on refurbishment at the hospital but there is an acceptance by all parties that more substantial redevelopment is required.On the occasion of my visit to the Central Mental Hospital, I established a project team to examine the various options for the redevelopment of the hospital and I expect to receive its recommendations early next year. We have also drawn up a service level agreement for the admission of mentally ill prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital and the additional funding I am announcing today will enable the hospital to start that process.In response to Deputy Cowley and others, we have achieved much with our investment in the health services. I will circulate to him a copy of the evaluation report of the national cancer strategy which I launched today, which shows significant progress in the past five years in cancer services in the State. People in the House should acknowledge the progress that has been made.

People can criticise, I have no problem with that, but listening to what some say, it is as if nothing has been invested and nothing has happened. The bottom line is that, year on year, we are now at 98% of the average spending of the 14 EU countries. Our public health expenditure per capita in 2001 was $15 purchasing power parity. We have had year on year spending increases of 18.2% in 2002, 12.4% in 2003 and 10.7% for 2004. These increases will bring Ireland above the EU average for the current year. I thank Deputies for the freedom they allowed me to articulate my views.

Budget day is when the Minister for Finance sets out his vision for the coming year and puts in place the strategic direction for the country for the next few years. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has now presented seven budgets and in that time we have witnessed a remarkable change in terms of economic and social inclusion in Ireland. We have moved from the era of high taxation to having the lowest tax base in the European Union. Recently there was a severe downturn in the international economy. We have weathered this better than most of our neighbours and we are poised to reap the benefit of growth in international trade.At the same time, the less well off have had their benefits increased by much more than inflation. It is worth noting that the improvements in social welfare this year will cost €630 million, an increase of €100 million on 2002. I also welcome the decision to pay all social welfare increases from 1 January. This contrasts sharply with the situation some years ago when recipients of social welfare increases had to wait for up to five months before they got the increases ordained in the budget.Due to the changes implemented by the Minister, the old age pension now stands at €167 per week. Last year, Fianna Fáil promised to deliver an old age pension of €200 in the lifetime of the Government and that commitment will be met. The increase of €10 per week is well above inflation. Taken in conjunction with the other increases, it is a definitive example of the Government's commitment to the less well-off and more vulnerable in society.The fact that over 41,000 taxpayers will pay no tax next year as a result of the financial considerations in this budget is a further example of our commitment. This Minister and Government are determined that there will be social equality in Ireland and the contents of this year's budget prove this point.The Minister has made the important decision to implement the next phase of decentralisation. When the spatial strategy was first announced, people welcomed that, at long last, something was being done to counteract the sprawl of Dublin. Gateways were identified as the main focus of growth but it was also indicated that each gateway would have a number of hubs, smaller centres of growth, that would help the area around the gateway to thrive. Real fears were expressed by people in rural areas that each gateway would swamp the locality and mini-Dublins, with all the attendant problems, would be created. I have attended many meetings organised by rural communities where such fears were articulated. The decision by the Minister to implement the spatial strategy is welcome, but I congratulate him on his boldness in locating whole Departments away from Dublin.Eight Departments will be relocated in this way and it is to the hubs, not the gateways, that they are being moved. The only gateway that will house a relocated Department is Mullingar, which has special considerations of its own although it shares its gateway status with Athlone and Tullamore. The decision to locate Departments in the regions is timely, but the decision to locate them in smaller towns is particularly welcome.As a Deputy from the west, the relocation of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Knock is good news and gives the lie to those who have argued that this Government is ignoring the west. Recently, some Members have attempted to make political capital out of the fact that the west has not got its fair share but since the decentralisation moves were announced yesterday, the same Members are shouting that the gateways have been ignored.

I warmly welcome the news that my home town, Sligo, has had an extra 100 jobs relocated to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. There was a real fear some months ago that some of the jobs in the Department were to be transferred or lost but, not only has this not happened, an extra 100 jobs will be brought there, reinforcing the town's importance as a gateway.

In order to maintain our competitive edge, it is essential that we develop our research and development capacity. Multinational companies will go to where costs are cheapest. Our future is based on creating an environment where our well educated young people have the opportunity to get interesting and well paid jobs and, hence, it is important to attract overseas companies that are willing to locate their research and development divisions in Ireland and to encourage Irish companies to strengthen their research and development divisions. We have the workforce capable of research and development at the highest level. Allowing companies to offset 20% of their expenditure on research and development against corporation tax is a welcome development and will ensure our young, well educated workforce jobs in Ireland.This budget will ensure that the country continues its growth and development in the coming years while allowing social justice and dignity to the most vulnerable in society. I commend the budget to the House.

It is a progressive budget that is of particular importance to rural areas. The Minister made an innovative decision in deciding to decentralise Government Departments on a huge scale. I am bemused by people who talk about the need for rural development and lament the depopulation of rural Ireland, particularly the west, but who, when a positive decision is made to reverse that trend, immediately cast doubt on it. I am surprised that Deputy Cowley who has talked about rural development and the difficulties that the west faces would be sceptical of a decentralisation programme that has the potential to change the economic dynamics of the country. I am particularly glad that my home county of Cavan will have the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with 425 jobs in Cavan town.

Those of us who have been privileged to be Members of this House for some time have listened to people on all sides of the House, both party members and Independent Deputies, speak ad infinitum about the serious imbalance in economic development. We are all well aware of the need to redress this imbalance which tilts to the east coast with its greater population and economic development, and its congestion problems. We read in the newspapers and hear on the broadcast media self-appointed commentators talk about the difficulties facing people commuting from Wexford, Carlow, Westmeath, Longford, Laois, Cavan, Louth and so on. Those commentators were first out of the traps yesterday evening and this morning casting doubts on the wisdom of such a large-scale decentralisation programme. They are talking out of both sides of their mouths. Their attitude is so begrudging that when a Government makes a positive decision to go for a major change in economic policy they can respond only with negatives.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I recall working in the 1980s as a civil servant with the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, John Wilson, who initiated the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal, the first real cross-Border project since the late 19th century. When we started that project we received only criticism to the effect that it could not be done because it was in Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim, because of its cross-Border context, the engineering difficulties or that the funding would never be available. The then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the then Minister for Tourism and Transport said they were determined to bring that flagship project to fruition which they did within two years. A total of £30 million was invested in restoring a waterway then known as the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal, now known as the Erne-Shannon Waterway, which is one of the success stories of today's tourism product. The begrudgers outside and in this House will have egg on their faces again because the decentralisation programme will be successful.

The begrudgers should be positive for a change and look at the advantages that will come from that decentralisation programme. We have listened for far too long to different industrial promotion agencies and Departments tell us that it is not possible to bring anything out of the capital city. It is possible. Two major international firms have headquarters in my county, the Quinn Group in Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and Ballyconnell employs 3,000 people, and the Kingspan Group, an international company, is based in Kingscourt, County Cavan. These companies are big players in the international arena and their headquarters are in provincial Ireland. Running Departments from the provinces will be equally successful.

They show the Government's commitment to looking after those who are less well-off and rely on social welfare. I especially welcome the additional €25 million allocation to assist people with disabilities, reflecting the Government's commitment to people with disabilities. The additional €30 million for school buildings is very necessary because many schools need new buildings and extensions.

I also welcome the tax exemption increase on limits for leased farmland and a new rural social scheme for farmers with a herd number who are on farm assist or UA. I congratulate the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, on creating this new scheme which provides very valuable extra income for 2,500 low-paid farmers. We have heard a great deal about the cutbacks in numbers on CE schemes but this new rural social scheme will free up spaces on the CE schemes for other applicants. I compliment this Government and the Minister for Finance on announcing this major and very welcome programme of decentralisation covering over 10,000 jobs, in 53 centres in 25 counties, 160 of those jobs will go to east Galway.The decision to locate 19 National Roads Authority and 20 Railway Safety Commission jobs in Ballinasloe, and 40 road haulage and ten National Safety Council jobs in Loughrea, is a great vote of confidence in both towns. Those being relocated can be assured of a very warm welcome when they move. The provision of 160 new jobs will give a significant economic boost not only to Ballinasloe and Loughrea, but to regions generally and will maintain and create additional jobs in local enterprises. People questioned the Government's commitment to the national spatial strategy but they have got their answer today and now the private sector must follow suit and reduce its dependence on Dublin. Only then will we have real balanced regional development.The Government's continued commitment to investing in infrastructure will enhance the attraction of provincial towns for significant investment. Ballinasloe has been hit hard in recent years with the closure of AT Cross and Square D but it will be a lovely place to live because a new leisure centre opened there a few weeks ago and it has a new secondary school and marina. This is a first for Ballinasloe and it will attract more people and restore confidence to a town that is quite dead. We have been looking for this move for some time.There has been a worldwide recession in recent years but we have had a very good Government and Minister for Finance who has brought us through from bad times to good times with very little suffering. I congratulate him on this. He has returned us to a position where unemployment will be down, inflation is down by 2.5%, gross spending is just under 7.5% and Exchequer borrowing is €2.8 billion. This is a Government worthy of admiration.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Before addressing some of the specifics of this budget, I would like to echo what has been said by my party colleagues and others regarding the lack of real difference it will make to the tens of thousands of people who are finding it difficult to make ends meet. That situation will not be improved as a result of what we heard in the House yesterday. I acknowledge the marginal changes introduced, but they will not effect much improvement in the circumstances of the people currently struggling in my constituency.Regarding my own area of interest, agriculture and rural development, there were some positive developments. Sinn Féin welcomes the commitment to further decentralise Departments and believes this should be further extended. Others have claimed that the move will undermine the national spatial strategy but I know from my own region that the strategy promises to deliver very little in terms of real decentralisation of jobs or public services. It all looks very well on paper but delivery is not occurring. I only hope that the decentralisation measure announced in the budget will have real substance and will be implemented as quickly as possible.Sinn Féin has long advocated radical decentralisation, and a genuine commitment to this would help to address many of the problems that afflict rural Ireland. However, the manner in which this measure was announced and the way it is being used does not give great cause for hope. It is a disgrace that Tralee, for example, the capital town of Kerry, which was designated a hub town in the spatial strategy, is not included in the locations where the decentralised Department offices will be placed. More than 25,000 people live in Tralee. The town has a technology park and a technological institute, is located within seven miles of an airport and has had a massive improvement to its road infrastructure, yet it was excluded or overlooked.On farming, I welcome the increase in the tax relief on leases and the lowering of the qualifying age to 40. More needs to be done to encourage the entrance of trained young farmers to the industry. The recently published compendium on Irish agriculture proved that there has been almost no change in the age structure of Irish farming over the past decade. In 1993, just 35% of farmers were under the age of 45, and shamefully that remains the case.Nothing has been done to reverse the cuts in the budget available to Teagasc, and this situation will continue to have a detrimental effect on the levels of research and training available to farmers. Not only will it have local effects where centres like Ballinamore have been shut down, but it will also have massive implications for the ability of Irish agriculture to adapt to a radically changing European and world environment. This is particularly relevant to the current reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and to the changes to production that will follow on the introduction of decoupling.It is no use advising farmers that they can take advantage of the reform to move into different forms of production and land use if the expertise is not available to show the different systems that will be of most value to the relevant farmers. The great shame of cutting back on Teagasc is that it will lead to a brain drain from agriculture and many highly educated people will be lost to the future of the industry. As a result of the cut in the budget for Teagasc last year, Teagasc had to sell State assets in order to maintain its service. That situation has not been redressed this year and the result could be the abolition of Teagasc as an advisory body to the Irish farming community.If the reform is to work it will be necessary to establish the kind of programmes that will help farmers adapt to the changes. It is not good enough to hope this will be catered for under EU programmes like the farm advisory service that is part of the reform package. It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure this is done and that it takes account of specific Irish strengths and weaknesses.A new strategy is required that will allow farmers to take advantage of decoupling and prepare rural communities in general for the future. The rural social scheme announced in the budget and the funding made available for it will be inadequate to fulfil that task. It will not even replace the number of community employment schemes lost to rural communities and rural communities will suffer as much as everyone else from the consequences of the failure to maintain adequate public services.One accusation that is regularly thrown at anyone who advocates radical alternatives to current economic policies is that they do not present any other coherent means of financing a different approach. I do not accept that there are no alternatives, nor that the revenue to finance them could not be found. The Sinn Féin pre-budget submission details some of these. I will cite one particular example in an area that has once again come under some scrutiny in recent weeks, namely the control and taxation regime that governs our natural resources, or to be more specific, the lack of control and taxation over our oil and gas reserves. If the State exercised its proper role on behalf of the people in that sector, oil and gas revenue could play a major part in financing future progressive developments. We have heard the Minister for Finance explain why even minimal changes to the taxation regime such as broadening the 20% tax band to exclude more of the lower paid was not possible at present. Yet his party has proven itself in the past to be more than capable of introducing tax benefits for others, which have been far more radical and costly in terms of lost revenue.The terms governing the exploitation of our natural resources – exploitation is indeed how it should be described – are a good case in point. It has long been known that there is massive potential in the oil and gas that lies beneath Irish waters. When that first became a major issue in the mid-1970s, Sinn Féin was one of those groups which argued that the reserves ought to be taken under State control in the interests of the Irish people as a whole. I worked on an oil rig off the Irish coast and was present at a major oil discovery which was tapped and left for a future date. It was considered one of the major finds on the Porcupine Bank at the time and remains there to this day. Instead of the State proactively seeking to develop what was there, and investing the necessary finance and skills, it was content to auction the options off to multi national corporations. While initially there may have been some attempt to maintain the public interest, gradually over the years the terms and conditions have been further eroded to the extent that we now have almost no real stake in what lies off our shores.Major changes were introduced to the benefit of the corporations. In 1987, the then Minister for energy, Ray Burke, decided to do away with royalties. In 1992, the then Minister for Finance and current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, reduced the tax on oil finds to 25%, the lowest in the world. The companies can write even that off. Frontier licences were also introduced in 1992 which allow the oil companies to sit on areas of likely reserves for up to 20 years. If one considers the discoveries made in 1979, the oil companies can sit on them for another seven years. Ever since, when these terms have been challenged, successive Ministers have claimed they are necessary to encourage the development of the oil and gas sector. However, the opposite has happened as the number of exploratory drills declined after 1987.Right up to the present, when I have asked questions regarding these terms and the likely benefits to accrue from recent finds such as that at the Dooish Well off Donegal, I am told the same thing. Where is the proof that all these great benefits, such as those referred to in this House by the Taoiseach two weeks ago, will come on stream? Does the State even know what is there or what the exploration companies know lies in the sectors under their control? It has been admitted that the State has no means of independently verifying what Shell or the other multinational oil companies tell it.This is important, because when the Corrib field was discovered in 1996, Irish rig workers knew that the find was massive. This was confirmed by a report by Wood Mackenzie which claimed that the field could contain up to seven trillion cubic feet of gas. At current prices this is worth €21 billion. If we develop our resources and exploit them for the benefit of the people, we will go a long way towards helping those who are most in need in our community and who were ignored in this and previous budgets.

While Members on the Government side celebrated the budget last night, many on this side hope they were more circumspect in their support of it when they awoke in the cold light of dawn this morning. As Government Deputies were saying their prayers before they jumped into their nice warm beds last night, did they think of the beneficiaries of community employment schemes who, they hope, will have forgotten that they voted three times against extending the schemes? That is difficult to credit, considering what we heard last week.It is now 24 hours since the Minister for Finance made his Budget Statement. With the exception of decentralisation, the budget was a mere housekeeping exercise with little thought for taxpayers.The poor, as usual, fared worst. The social welfare increases leave them no better off. Even Members on the Government side will admit that. Once indirect taxes and other costs are factored into the equation, the poor are slightly worse off. As usual, middle Ireland will pay the bulk of the price of keeping the country on the straight and narrow. Tax relief was hardly affected and building can continue at the same profitable level. The budget was a straightforward housekeeping exercise which contributed nothing.The reason for our low tax and low spend economy is, we are told, that it is what the voters want. We have such diabolical levels of public services because we do not bring in the necessary revenue. Is there any hope of making improvements in the next few years? I believe there is. We must scrutinise more carefully how we spend the €35 billion which the Government plans to spend next year.Some €10 billion will be spent on the health services but where will that money go? We never seem to ask serious questions about health spending. The Minister for Health and Children listed the many improvements in the health service for which we are expected to give him credit. He referred to the number of patients being treated for cancer. This is fine if one simply looks at the number being treated, but do we ever compare our treatment levels with international norms? Only 20% of cancer patients receive radiotherapy and the number of Irish people who receive chemotherapy is far below the European average. Let us forget about comparing 1996 with 2003. Let us look at what one could expect if one lived in another EU country and compare that with Ireland. Why are we so far behind other countries? The Minister says we are spending the same amount of money as other EU countries. We are not. The Minister quotes selectively. Between €1.5 billion and €2 billion of the health budget is a social welfare budget, but this is rarely commented upon.The Hanly report has, thankfully, been conclusively discarded and thrown in the bin, but many influential people and people in Government hold on to the ideas and recommendations of the Hanly report.

We must address this issue.Benchmarking is not simply a public service pay rise but is related to productivity. The measure will cost €1 billion, not merely this year but every year. Moves have been made to paint benchmarking as some sort of pay rise and the Government seems to have little enthusiasm for the implementation of the productivity issues related to it. An extra €1 billion per year could have been well spent in increasing the number of medical cards. This is not a glamorous issue, but for someone trying to get a medical card, it is a serious one. If one factors out the over-70s deal, which was not means-tested, was a vote buying exercise and contravenes medical ethics, approximately one person in four has a medical card. A medical card is considerably more useful than a social welfare increase of €5 or €6 per week. Every Deputy should face up to this important issue. At the height of the Celtic tiger era, 35% of people had medical cards and the figure has declined to just more than 25%.The money could equally have been spent on hospitals or schools. It is nice to learn that an extra €30 million will be spent on schools and on disability issues. However, benchmarking will cost €1 billion, so we should insist that it is made to work.Contrary to what might be happening in the north-west, the rest of the country does not have a world class health service. We will never have one if the situation continues as it is. The best we can hope for is to get the basics right.Regardless of the fine talk about what we can expect in future, our health policy formulators would learn more from Havana than from Boston because we will never spend the money on our health service. It is not just infrastructure that needs a coherent, strategic and cost-effective approach to spending. This approach should be adopted in every Department because money is being wasted in all public services.The only interesting aspect of the budget was the Minister's announcement of decentralisation measures. Many speakers have said they are looking forward to seeing 50, 100 or 150 civil servants in their constituencies. Even some who made negative comments on the measure claimed to have been calling for it for many years. We must be realistic about the proposal. How many people believe that 10,000 civil servants will pack their bags and move out of Dublin within three years? Are they to be marched onto the parade yard of Dublin Castle and asked, "Hands up for Wexford" or "Hands up for Killarney"?

Many people resent the proposal and have no interest in leaving Dublin. Many officials at middle and higher grades have established themselves in Dublin, their families go to school in Dublin, they have integrated into their neighbourhoods and have no interest in decentralisation. We must be realistic and honest about this plan. I would be surprised to see it implemented in three years, although I would love to see that happen.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I wish to give the House a brief traffic report. I travelled to my home and back to the House this evening. The traffic is gridlocked. There is late night shopping on Thursday nights in Dublin and everyone is going into town because it is nearly Christmas. The traffic is back to back and no one is going anywhere.I wish to concentrate on the transport and traffic issue in my contribution. I believe that on foot of this budget nothing will be done to solve that problem and to make our city liveable for its citizens and for the economy.It is incredible to examine the five year capital programme which has been much trumpeted by the Government. Our solution to the traffic problem is to spend four times the amount on roads that is being spent on public transport. Most people will suggest investment in public transport as a solution to the problem of gridlock. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce expressed that view to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and IBEC and the AA are of the same view. Even the Government will admit it. The stark figures over five years of four to one in favour of roads rather than public transport mean that this Government will not fund the metro, which is a vital facility for the constituency I share with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. The roads bring traffic to Dublin very quickly but the problem begins when the traffic leaves the motorway and hits the villages of Templeogue, Terenure, Windy Arbour or Stillorgan. Gridlock is guaranteed and the budget does nothing about that problem.The national spatial strategy was trumpeted by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but it will not work if there is no proper connection between the hubs and gateways he mentioned. The western rail line will not be funded through this capital programme. Cork desperately needs suburban rail services to make it work as an alternative city to Dublin where investment can be directed.I wonder if I am on a different planet from the Government. Perhaps I am completely mistaken about what is happening. It could be that the UN reports I have been reading for the past 15 years, which state that a massive environmental problem is facing us, are all wrong. Perhaps the scientists who run the climate change programme are all wrong. It could be that the Government and President George Bush are correct and it will be no problem to burn oil forever and a day. I do not think we are wrong. This is the biggest issue facing us in the 21st century. Until we stop talking about it and start addressing it through budgets, we will never achieve change. We will be the laggards of Europe. Maybe the German and British Governments' policies for the reduction of CO2 emissions by 60% are wrong and we do not have a care in the world because our CO2 emissions have increased by 30% beyond what they should be. Is the Government aware of this issue? If its climate change strategy has any meaning, how can it present a budget which gives four times the amount of money to new roads than it does to public transport? It is incredible.The Minister of State may suggest that financing for the metro may be arranged through private financing under a public private partnership. We will pay a high cost in the process, but why should we choose that method? The city of Paris has a public transport system that works. The State expects one third of the revenue from the metro to cover one third of the costs while the State provides the rest in conjunction with local authorities and with business. This Government has an ideological problem with investing in public transport. The budget demonstrates this in the figures for the next five years and it is a disgrace. This city will be gridlocked and our constituency will be gridlocked with traffic unless the problem is addressed. The Luas extensions, the metro and the other capital projects are not provided for in this five year plan. This is a Government with no vision; it is merely treading water. It thinks everything is going fine and that this is a great little country. The people who are sitting in the traffic gridlock tonight probably do not agree.

I have no doubt that when the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, first became Minister for Finance he probably had ambitions to be a reforming Minister. He may have been extremely right-wing but he was someone who saw himself as a person who would stand up to vested interests and for what he believed in. I recall on the occasions of his first and second budgets that he spoke about the introduction of eco-taxes and the taxation of benefit-in-kind. He added humorously that his civil servants did not share his enthusiasm for the taxation of benefit-in-kind and that raised a laugh at the time.Years later we are still waiting for attacks on benefit-in-kind. The free city centre parking places for civil servants and politicians are still in use. The taxation of benefit-in-kind never happened and is unlikely to happen during the lifetime of the Government. Perhaps now that all these civil servants are moving down the country—
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	531	They are moving up the country to the Deputy's homeland.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Many of them are moving down the country, enough to free up many of the parking spaces. It might mean that the pressure would be less on the Minister and he could perhaps introduce a tax on benefit-in-kind. However, I have a feeling that this will remain an unfulfilled promise.It is like the promise to reinstate Leinster Lawn. The carpark was supposed to be temporary. An engineer told me that the foundations did not seem too temporary, in his view. I have been proven right in my doubts. The Leinster Lawn carpark is an example of the cowardice and deep cynicism of the Government. It is a metaphor for this budget. This is not a decentralisation budget, as it has been portrayed in the media and spun wonderfully by the party opposite, but what I term a carpark budget. Far from taxing carparking, the Government has incentivised carparks. As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, our cities are choking with cars, pollution is increasing, the rail service is on its knees and the Government builds and wants to build more carparks. That is a vision.It is a carpark budget because, like a carpark, it is cold, unimaginative and soulless. As Joni Mitchell once sang many years ago, "They paved paradise and put up a parking lot". This is a short-sighted Government which paradoxically has its eyes firmly on electoral success. It has decided that if it creates the right conditions for their paymasters, it can continue to buy elections. This is why, in its own calculated way, it widens the gap between rich and poor. The money squandered in other areas demonstrates its lack of vision, as Deputy Eamon Ryan said.This morning in the House the Minister for Social and Family Affairs treated the Opposition to the same sort of contempt she reserves for ordinary people who have suffered so much as a result of her Department's cutbacks. Whether one uses the calculation of GDP or GNP, Ireland has the lowest social expenditure in Europe. It also has the lowest tax take in Europe. If the tax take was slightly higher, poverty could be eliminated, we could have proper public transport and proper education.The Taoiseach said yesterday that he was embarrassed to speak about the tribunals to a high flyer in business circles. He said Ireland was only in the ha'penny place when it came to corruption. We are only in the ha'penny place when it comes to public services. I suggest the Government gets its act together. It cannot buy its way out of this situation. The electorate will see what it is doing. The Government can be cute enough up to the election, but eventually things will catch up with it. I hope the electorate will see through the Government because the Green Party certainly has done so.

I am disappointed by the personal attacks that have been made on some Ministers in the course of the debate. It is a sad day when fellow politicians go beyond political point scoring to indulge in such attacks. That should be taken into account because we all have feelings and try to do our jobs to the best of our ability. It is acceptable to criticise people from a political point of view but not to go beyond that.Having sat on the Opposition benches, I know how much fun it can be to tackle the Government on all the matters that were not covered in a budget. I could talk for three days about what I would like to see happen as a result of the budget, but I only have ten minutes. It is a question of balancing reality with aspiration but Opposition Deputies want all the problems in the health service to be solved, including those of the hospitals, in addition to providing medical cards and non-means tested care for everybody. They also want the problems of the education system solved, with all the primary and secondary schools rebuilt or refurbished, and all the third level institutions advanced to provide the best education ever. I could add roads to that list with many other things. While we all agree with these ideas, we must strike a balance between aspiration and reality. This also arises with regard to car parks which are very handy for shopping. Perhaps we should not have as many cars, but we need somewhere to park them.Much play was made by the Opposition in yesterday's debate about the 20 cent a day increase in child benefit. However, I have been in the House long enough to have seen the 25p per week or £1 per month budget increase in child benefit. We all agree that the world should be a better place but we must deal with the money that is available and examine how best it can be dispersed.Some people say that decentralisation is not a budgetary matter and should not have been included. I do not know why it came as a surprise, however, because we have been discussing it for years. The Minister said he could not move too fast because he had to consult all those involved but as soon as it was discussed, 10,000 civil servants appeared to be interested in the idea. I received phone calls in my constituency from people in Dublin who wanted to move home to Donegal. They wanted to know when decentralisation would happen. I am hopeful that the 120 decentralised jobs in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which have been earmarked for Buncrana, will be among the first to be filled. That is a boost the constituency requires.We have had a terrible time with job losses in the textile sector. Children left school early to work in the industry which later collapsed. It does not really matter whether the 120 new jobs in Buncrana will be filled by people living locally or by those coming back to live in the county; the reality is that within a generation people on the Inishowen peninsula and in the wider county of Donegal will be able to tell their sons or daughters that they have good job prospects for the future.The Minister has examined the idea of clustering, including Buncrana, Letterkenny, Donegal town and Gweedore. There will also be promotional opportunities arising from these jobs. If we were isolated from everywhere else people would not come to the county, but they will travel there now. People described on the radio today how they had moved out of Dublin to various locations. Decentralisation has been a success story and people confirm that it can and does work. People on the 6 o'clock news tonight said they would be delighted to see people coming into their areas as a result of decentralisation, and it will be a success. I thank the Minister for organising the decentralisation process because we are talking about tackling poverty, while trying to improve everybody's lifestyle. It might not happen next year but this plan will ensure that my area will benefit with other parts of the country. A rising tide will lift all boats and decentralisation will be an important catalyst in this regard.People have been arguing about the changes in the CE scheme. I welcome the new scheme introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, which recognises small farmers who are in receipt of social assistance. The scheme is designed to help people who are solely employed in farming and keep them in their localities. Such people might otherwise have tried unsuccessfully to join CE schemes. I remember the days when people were begging to get off CE schemes and later they were begging to get on them. This year the plan is much more practical because there is no fixed time limit, it provides direct services for the community and is for anyone with a herd number who is in receipt of farm assistance, unemployment assistance, disability assistance or unemployment benefit. They will automatically be offered a place, which will free up community employment schemes for those who are supposed to be using them to become more employable.Multi-annual budgets are very important. As politicians we often hear announcements about so much money being made available towards the end of the year that must be spent in the next fortnight. As a result, not all the money is used as constructively as it could be. The 10% roll-over is important because it means money for emergencies that remains unspent at this time of year should not be wasted. While it is not all wasted now, it is not used as constructively as possible. The majority of that money should be given out at the start of the year.People have asked me whether tax relief for films will be of any use to Donegal and I believe it can be because Ireland is now among the top six locations for film making in the world. As Chairperson of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I realise that we needed this tax break to keep going. Film Screen Ireland made a presentation to my committee and stated that the loss to the Revenue of the tax break was compensated for threefold by the extra employment and expenditure generated where filming was taking place. Now that the tax relief for films has been extended, I hope that Donegal and other areas will get a chance to attract such cinematographic projects. The statistics relating to income generated by film making in local areas are staggering.Donegal County Council will welcome the €30 million that has been made available for the local government fund. It will provide much needed assistance. In addition, the €30 million for the school building programme must also be welcomed because issues have arisen, particularly within the primary school sector. There are a number of schools in my area that require such action and in this context I have spoken to the Minister about the money that is available. I am aware that issues still have to be dealt with concerning secondary schools.The respite care grant recognises the importance of a sector that was first taken account of by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. It has increased constantly in a realistic fashion, by €100 at a time or more.People have complained that there is nothing in the budget for the less well off but The Irish Times accepted that the budget has helped the lowest earners. They are not trotting out the usual phrase that we are only interested in the well off people. The fact that the national minimum wage is rising to €7 proves that there is a commitment on the Government's part to ensuring that those in lower wage categories are better looked after than they have been in the past.I welcome the support for business research and development with the business expansion scheme, which is having an impact in County Donegal. We do not have enough businesses in the county and we want to see more locating there. Over the years, my constituency has suffered from isolation as well as a lack of infrastructure to which I have often referred. Others have criticised the budget for not solving such problems with a magic wand, but we must be realistic.I was glad to hear people referring to the budget as "McCreevy's book". The first year he introduced a budget, the Minister announced it was the first of five chapters of the first volume of a book. People laughed at that idea but they laughed less and less as the years went on. This budget is the second chapter of his second book. Some people say it is a nice, straightforward housekeeping budget, and there is a lot to be said for that. Let us solve matters as we get the resources to do so. I commend the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on bringing our economy back on line. I hope that those who might not have gained as much as they wanted this year will gain under the next chapter of volume 2.

In every economy the Government can pump money into the three main areas of health, education and social welfare – I understand it is €10 billion in each – but we need to examine the outturns in that regard. Every week the Committee of Public Accounts hears about some fault or other in the way money is spent. I would like the Minister to take some action in this area to ensure that each Department has some form of monitoring group which examines the way money is spent so that we get value for money and a good deal for the taxpayer. I often think taxes are collected by the hard-core and spent by the soft-centred. That is what we have to consider. We have to ensure a hard edge to our spend, take the example of what is happening each week in the Committee of Public Accounts and factor it into the way money is spent in each Department.We should also apply the same hard core attitude to spending the money as we do to collecting it. We should show the same diligence in that regard and ensure the taxpayer gets the best possible deal in terms of the roads infrastructure, the roll-out of broadband or any other area in the remit of the Departments. There are too many examples of overspends on the various roads programmes and technology projects being undertaken. The smallest road in my own constituency was to cost €15 million but it ended up costing €30 million.

The 116 redundancies announced yesterday by Penn Racquet Sports Company (Ireland) in Mullingar is part of a deeply worrying trend for the midlands. We must spur the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment into action to tackle the issue of employment in the BMW region. Yesterday evening, we heard a positive announcement on decentralisation, which has been advocated and for which we have agitated for many years. The joy and euphoria surrounding the announcement was tempered by the loss of 116 jobs at a company which has provided employment for many families over the past 30 years.I will not engage in platitudes but I express my heartfelt sympathy to the 116 workers of the Penn company and their extended families who will also be affected. Some of the workers have given virtually a lifetime of service to the factory and they took great pride in the excellent skills required. They exhibited tremendous and deep loyalty to the company over the years and did everything possible to ensure its survival. As Deputy Paul McGrath will vouch, they adopted new work practices and technology and the workforce was reduced by approximately 25% while maintaining the same level of production.The tennis balls manufactured in the company were produced to world-class standards. Those of us who have watched Wimbledon, the US Open in New York and other major tournaments will have seen them. The company's tennis balls represented something important in Mullingar and we were proud of them as a tremendous advertisement for the town. Coming at any time of the year, the announcement would be devastating news, but it is particularly devastating as we approach Christmas.Securing alternative employment for these workers must be a major priority and efforts in this regard must begin immediately. Retraining and reskilling will be required and FÁS and all the agencies must quickly get their act together. County Westmeath has suffered a series of redundancies. Yesterday's announcement comes in the wake of recent lay-offs at MSL, Powerscreen, Elan and Eriksson and is a body blow. The direct loss to the economy will be approximately €3.5 million and could reach €4 million. A significant number of workers will be affected, including many from outside Mullingar in towns such as Rochfortbridge Ballinacarrigy, Delvin and Kilbeggan. The company stated it would relocate to the Far East where labour costs are cheaper.We must offer opportunities to those affected. A strategic task force must be established to bring together business, trade unions and political representatives to devise a strategy to reverse the employment trend in the area. I call on the Tánaiste to come to the midlands and arrange for the establishment of a task force to address this issue and ensure the workers in question are given an opportunity to find employment. This must be done as a matter of urgency, particularly in view of the impact the job losses will have on workers and their wider families, who must pay mortgages. It will be particularly devastating for several married couples employed in the factory.The closure could also lead to the loss of an indirect job for every direct job lost, which means the full impact of the closure could be as many as 250 redundancies, which would be a serious blow for Westmeath. We may be about to gain 300 new jobs, but we could also lose 250 others. I ask the Tánaiste to do everything possible to help those affected.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter. The announcement that Penn Racquet Sports Company (Ireland) is to close and cease production in three or four weeks with the loss of 116 jobs is a sad day for a significant number of families in the Mullingar area. I sympathise with all the families involved. Many of the workforce now losing their jobs have been with the company from its first day in 1974 and have given it a lifetime of service. Unfortunately, they are receiving bad news today which will have a considerable impact on the economy. As Deputy Penrose pointed out, the closure will result in the loss of almost €4 million in direct payments annually in wages. In addition, a further 150 to 200 jobs in spin-off work could be lost in the wider community. The company was long established, did its business locally and made a significant input to the community. We were all proud of it, and its closure is a major loss to the town.In 2001, the Penn Racquet Sports Company in Mullingar exported 23 million tennis balls throughout the world. These were of top standard and were proof of the quality work done in the midlands area. I am particularly disappointed with the closure, given that the company and its workforce worked in the past ten years to try to remain competitive.Deputies tend not to realise the difficulties facing business. For example, the Penn company has not received an increase in the price of its tennis ball in the past eight years, yet it has had to absorb additional costs, such as insurance, electricity, wage increases and so forth, to try to remain competitive. The workforce was up to this challenge, improved its output and co-operated with the bosses on improving skills, productivity and the cost base. This extended to reducing the lighting in the factory to keep down costs. Unfortunately, the point has been reached where the company can no longer carry on. This is due to a shrinking market and over-capacity caused by competition in the Far East where tennis balls can be produced at a low standard.With all due respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, I am particularly disappointed that the Tánaiste is not present. She met a deputation from the tennis ball sector six or eight months ago when, in the presence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, proposals were put to her on how the Department could help keep the sector afloat. The sector recognised at that stage that it faced difficulties and asked the Tánaiste to intervene. Realising now that she was aware of the problems and could have made an input at that time, it is disappointing she has not turned up to address the issue this evening. Members of the workforce and management will also be disappointed when they realise that having done their best and indicated in advance the difficulties facing the company, the Tánaiste has failed to respond. Perhaps she or the Minister of State will make up for this by announcing this evening that a task force will be established in the Mullingar area.Deputy Penrose outlined the job losses we have experienced in recent times, which is a new phenomenon in Mullingar. Until recently, the town had not lost jobs, it had a good record of maintaining employment. The news is, therefore, disappointing. I hope the Tánaiste will move quickly to set up a task force to attract alternative industry to the factory, which is a fine and valuable plant in a prestigious location. Such a task force must bring together the various relevant sectors to try to ensure that alternative employment is found for those affected. As we approach Christmas, it is a sad time for them.

I join forces with all sides of the House in highlighting the difficulties being experienced by the staff who have been loyal and dedicated to this factory. Both workers and management have been a great example to everyone involved in industry in Ireland. I am sure IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS know that these people in Mullingar are losing their jobs because of low cost wages in the Far East. I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, the Tánaiste and everyone concerned to get together to do something for this tried and trusted workforce which has made many sacrifices. These people are loyal, dedicated and committed and can be trusted with whatever work they are given in future.Yesterday was a great day in terms of decentralisation. Members from the county on all sides of both Houses made the case for that for many years. The news about this factory was heartbreaking. I support everything that was said. The darkest day may be close. Mullingar is a great location, as was stated by Deputies Paul McGrath and Penrose. These people are our priority, especially coming up to Christmas.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I thank Deputies Paul McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter on the Adjournment and Deputy Cassidy for his contribution.It was with great disappointment that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment learned of the decision by Penn Racquet Sports Company Ireland to close its plant in Mullingar with the loss of 116 staff. She is conscious of the effect the closure of the plant will have on Mullingar, especially on the workers and their families.The company manufactures tennis balls mainly for the European market and competes with companies which have moved production to low cost locations such as the Philippines and Indonesia. Major European tennis ball manufacturing facilities have closed and moved to the Far East to source product. A depressed and extremely competitive marketplace, coupled with the growing strength of the euro against the dollar, were major factors behind the decision to close the Mullingar plant. In addition, the parent company has two under-utilised manufacturing plants and decided to close Mullingar and move worldwide tennis ball production to Phoenix in Arizona. The latter plant has the capacity to produce Penn's global tennis ball requirements at a cost substantially lower than in Mullingar and without substantial incremental investments. Unfortunately, it is expected that all staff will be made redundant at the plant by the end of March 2004.IDA Ireland has been aware of the difficult market conditions being encountered by the company in recent years and has worked with the company on improving processes designed to cut production costs and research and development of new market specific products. FÁS will make immediate contact with the Mullingar company and offer its full range of services, including training, job placement and other services, with a view to facilitating the workers in finding alternative employment.The Government's commitment to regional development is stronger than ever and it is determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction, such as Mullingar. For its successful development, each region needs to have clear, competitive reasons why companies would wish to locate there rather than elsewhere. The State agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Westmeath County Development Board and County Council, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. This existing cooperative framework can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job losses and job creation in the area. These agencies have been efficient in my area which has lost a number of jobs in recent months.

The CABAS school for children with autism in Drogheda was set up in March 2003 as part of a pilot project with funding until August 2004. There has been much correspondence with the Department of Education and Science about this matter. There are seven similar schools throughout the country, of which three are CABAS schools.There are 18 children attending the school and it has a staff of 21. There is a waiting list of almost 50 children for places at the school. Two of the children are partially mainstreamed and they have the support of their teachers at the Drogheda school. All the other children are making tremendous progress. Their lives and those of their parents and families have been transformed. The staff come from a variety of backgrounds, although their qualifications are principally degree based. Three of the staff are attending a master's programme in applied behavioural analysis at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, which is the first of its kind in the country. All the staff participate in intensive detailed work on house training.The Drogheda school is operating in a three bedroom house in a housing estate. The community hopes to rent a more suitable property soon. However, it can only sign a lease until the end of August 2004 and that is causing extreme difficulty. The school has tried repeatedly to get a decision from the Department as quickly as possible, but it has been unsuccessful up to now. However, the Department has been supportive in allowing this project to proceed as far as it has. As a result of its success, the commitment shown by the people and the progress made, a decision must be made to allow the staff to continue to teach.In a recent ministerial letter, the Minister stated that a review of the pilot programme is being carried out and that a decision would be made during the current school year. However, that will end in June and the school's funding runs out in August. It is not acceptable to have such a short period of notice. The parents want this decision expedited. If the Minister could give a commitment on when the decision will be made, they could plan ahead. It is a successful experimental programme. I and other Deputies in the constituency and in County Meath have received weekly letters on this issue. It is exceptionally difficult for anyone who has a child with autism, and anything which helps them to make progress is worthy of support. I hope the Minister of State has good news for us.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I thank Deputy O'Dowd for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am pleased to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to clarify the position on the matter referred to by him.ABHAILE, which is the CABAS school in Drogheda, was established in February 2003 with a current enrolment of 18 pupils. CABAS is a registered trademark of a model for education called a comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling. The model was established in 1981 by Dr. R. Douglas Greer, a professor of education and psychology at the Teachers College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Columbia University in New York.The ABA method is one of a range of models of approach to the education of children with autism. The ABA approach is based on understanding a set of behaviours, breaking down the components of the tasks involved in learning and the application of consequences either to reduce or weaken or increase or strengthen a specific behaviour or set of behaviours. The ABA approach involves intensive intervention requiring a minimum of one to one and at times two to one staffing support. It operates for up to 48 weeks per year.The role of ABA was considered in detail by the task force on autism. The task force concluded that ABA, in common with a range of other models, has a valuable contribution to make within an eclectic approach to education provision for children with autism. Prior to October 1998, the Department of Education and Science did not recognise the distinct educational needs of children with autism. Provision for such children was made through placement in special schools or classes which cater for children with emotional disturbance or mild general learning disability.There are now seven facilities in the State operating on a pilot project basis and using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum. Three of the seven are CABAS facilities, including ABHAILE, whose teaching method involves a comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling approach.A decision regarding the retention of these establishments will be made in light of an evaluation of provision for children with an autistic spectrum disorder, which is currently being carried out by the Department of Education and Science's inspectorate. It is envisaged that the outcome of the evaluation will be determined and a decision taken on the future of the facilities during the course of the current school year. However, I will raise the point about reaching an early decision with the Minister.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing a debate such as this that will be of keen interest to many people around the country, not just for environmental reasons, in the vital role wind power will play in the reduction of our CO2 emissions, but also in the development of an industry that should have enormous potential for Ireland, which we are totally failing to develop.Some people in the industry lay a lot of the blame at the door of the ESB which, they say, has been reluctant and even restrictive in the development of wind energy over the years. I found this hard to believe given that the ESB is a forward-thinking company. Yet, one has to believe that the conservative approach it has taken, especially the network company, in the development of wind energy bears out those criticisms. Some people have even described Eirgrid as comparable to the supermodels of the renewable energy industry in that they would not get out of bed for less than €10,000 if one wanted a grid connection. Now we see that they do not want to issue another grid connection, as they fear that the grid will not be able to take it.The question we must ask them, and hope the Minister for Communications Marine and Natural Resources will ask them, is why they differ so much from the contents of the Garrad Hassan report which clearly states that while there may be a need for curtailment of wind farms as they increase generation, that only becomes a significant issue approaching the level of 2,000 MW of power being supplied. Also, on the ability of renewable wind energy to meet the grid code requirements the ESB would naturally want to set for any operators selling into their grid, the report's executive summary states quite clearly that these can be met by renewable speed turbine technology without any significant cost. The real question that should be put to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is why that grid code, which seems to be the key issue, was not agreed years ago. At the very last minute, operators who have gone to enormous expense to obtain planning permission to establish the projects are told out of the blue that there are no further grid connections. The ESB, in its letter to the regulator on the issue, makes the remarkable statement that it thought everything was going wonderfully when Irish wind production was increasing by a nice 20 MW a year. That is an incredible statement when other countries, like Germany and others, have something like 15,000 MW of power and none of the wind power potential we have.Why has the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources not compiled a co-ordinated energy policy on this issue? It was remarkable that at the same time the regulator was issuing his press release stating there could be no further wind contracts, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources issued a press release trumpeting the budget contents that would allow for further tax breaks on more projects, adding that he hoped to obtain an additional 140 MW from the European Commission. It demonstrates a remarkable lack of co-ordination, on the Minister's part, that he apparently did not know what the regulator was going to say on the matter or what the ESB felt, let alone what is happening in the industry.The most important question for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, further to the question I tabled, is why, like so many other Ministers, he has failed to implement a European directive on renewable energy sources, that this country was obliged to enforce by 27 October? The directive specifically sets out the requirement on the Government, the industry, the regulator and the network operator to guarantee that we will develop the maximum potential renewable energy that we can.We have enormous potential in this country for renewable energy. I was at a conference organised by the European Investment Bank in Dublin, attended by all the leading people in the industry throughout Europe. One speaker after another said how remarkable it was that this country, with the greatest wind potential in Europe, was the slowest and worst at developing its wind industry. This was embarrassing and frightening in the context of the environmental and future economic consequence consequences of our failure. I, industry representatives and other Opposition spokespersons will be increasingly asking the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources what he is doing, why he sat back and did nothing on this issue and why the Government has allowed us to be seen as the laughing stock of Europe in the field of developing renewable energy.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to clarify for the House the factual impacts of the commission's decision. The commission's decision, exercising its functions under section 34 of the Act, was to permit the network operators to withhold formal connection offers for wind farms until the end of the year for reasons set out in the published decision. There is nothing in the decision to suggest wind capacity connected to the network will be limited to 500 MW. On the contrary, the supporting documentation, also posted on the commission's website, indicates that existing wind powered renewable energy plant, and current binding offers for wind farms, amount to 775 MW.The commission's decision is valid only until the year's end, approximately three weeks from now. There is nothing in the decision to suggest a deferral until 2005. On both these important points, the Deputy is incorrect.The network operator expressed concerns which are also supported by an independent report prepared for the commission and Ofreg by international consultants. The report, by Garrad Hassan, concluded that the amount of wind generation capacity, which could be accepted on to the network by 2005, is anywhere between 790 MW and 2840 MW. However, if developers continue to self-dispatch, the lower figure applies.The factual position based on documents published by the Commission for Energy Regulation is that ESB National Grid, ESBNG, wrote to the Commission for Energy Regulation setting out its serious concerns caused by increasing market interest in securing connections for wind farms of the order of 1295 MW. ESBNG stated in its submission that the amount of wind generation, either currently connected to the system or holding binding offers, had reached approximately 775 MW and asked that no further binding wind generation connection offers be made until technical issues are resolved.The commission in its letter dated yesterday, 3/12/2003, stated that on an exceptional basis it would approve the proposal to cease issuing offers for wind connections until the end of the year. The letter also contains several qualifications and conditions which in my opinion, without commenting on the independence of the commission, is indicative of positive concerns to pursue national and EU policies on promoting renewable energy technologies in the electricity market. The commission decision does not restrict the level of access of wind power at the national level below 500 MW as the Deputy stated. On the contrary, the decision commences a public debate on the issues facing the wind energy market. In this regard, the commission has invited written submissions to be received by 19 December. It has also asked ESB National Grid to host a public meeting with the market players to explain its position and to examine remedies.The target to increase consumption of renewable energy-based electricity in Ireland to 13.2% by 2010, is an EU obligation under Directive (2001/77/EC) on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. The Minister's minimum target is to have sufficient renewable energy-based generating capacity in place to generate this volume by 2010. Nothing in the commission's decision will frustrate this objective. The current national target for all renewable technologies is to add a minimum 500 MW of generating capacity to the grid by 2005. In order to ensure this minimum target can be delivered under reasonable assumptions, it is proposed to offer contracts for up to 720 MW in total, under the national support programme, subject to EU state aids clearance. This capacity, together with generating capacity from existing renewable energy plant, as defined in the directive, could increase the percentage of green electricity to more than 12% by 2006 if all projects selected in AER 5 and AER 6 are built. Nothing in the commission's decision frustrates these targets.On climate change, Ireland has committed to limiting the increase in greenhouse gas emissions to no more than 13% above 1990 levels by 2008-2012. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Martin Cullen, has primary responsibility to drive the climate change agenda. In this regard he published the national climate change strategy in October 2000. This document provides a framework for the actions needed to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target. The strategy is currently under review with updates expected on emission projections and measures needed. The target set for the renewable energy-based electricity market equates to an additional 31 MW per annum for ten years. The current national support programme is capable of delivering that target irrespective of the commission's decision.The five year network upgrading programme, costing approximately €3 billion, is well under way. As the network upgrade progresses it will deliver major improvements in the network system, thereby facilitating enhanced capacity and quality of service capability for all users including green electricity producers.Without prejudice to the actual content or conclusions within the consultation process, already commenced by the Commission for Energy Regulation, I believe the immediate issues facing wind farms are more immediate. They will, I believe, concentrate in the first instance on the technical parameters of turbines connecting to the networks and the interacting operational arrangements with the networks.The grid upgrade development programme is essential to the future development of the renewable energy sector, but it is not key to the solutions required in the short term to address the immediate concern raised by the network operator on the grounds of system stability. The decision made by the commission is a decision of an independent office. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on it one way or another.This document provides a framework for the actions needed to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 43 together.I welcome the opportunity to report to the House on the discussions which took place at the recent EU defence ministerial meeting on the margins of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, which was held in Brussels on 17 November last.Key issues discussed were current and possible future EU-led peace support operations including the proposed EU takeover of the UN mandated NATO-led stabilisation operation, SFOR, in Bosnia Herzegovina, capabilities shortfalls and capabilities development post-2003, EU-NATO relations, common training, the protection of civilian populations against the treat of terrorism and the Mediterranean dimension of European security and defence policy.Following the European Council at Thessaloniki in June 2003, it was decided by heads of state to task the appropriate bodies of the Council to undertake the necessary actions towards creating, in the course of 2004, an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments. At the meeting of 17 November as part of the discussion on capabilities and capabilities development it was decided to bring forward this work.This agency, which will be subject to the Council's authority and open to participation by all member states, will aim at developing defence capabilities in the field of crisis management, promoting and enhancing European armaments co-operation, strengthening the European defence industrial and technological base and creating a competitive European defence equipment market, as well as promoting, in liaison with the Community's research activities where appropriate, research aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, thereby strengthening Europe's industrial potential in this domain.In this context, the meeting endorsed the report presented on the proposed agency as the basis for carrying this work forward and adopted a decision to create an agency establishment team. The Council invited the Secretary General-High Representative to implement that decision as soon as possible, with a view to the team starting work in January 2004.The agency establishment team will submit proposals to the council, with a view to launching the agency in the course of 2004.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 30 and 48 together.The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps in July 2002, was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced. The programme was a significant one, including as it did, the proposed purchase of three medium range helicopters for search and rescue with the option for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport.The decision to cancel the tender competition was an extremely difficult one for me. The subsequent lease of a S61 helicopter, however, ensured that the Air Corps could retain its role in providing SAR services in the north west upon the withdrawal of the Dauphin helicopter from that service.When the decision to cancel the tender competition was made, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopters services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position.An interdepartmental working group was established to examine and consider alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships, with a view to providing medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance was also involved in assisting the working group in identifying and assessing possible solutions.

This scenario led to the consideration of options for a possible EU Petersberg Tasks crisis management operation under Article 17.2 of the Treaty on European Union. As the exercise concentrated on the pre-decisional phase of the crisis management scenario, it was purely a desktop exercise. The exercise also actively tested civilian aspects in the context of civilian operational planning.CME/CMX 03 was conducted in Brussels and in national capitals. On the EU side, it involved all member states, the Secretary General-High Representative, the Commission and the EU Satellite Centre.This exercise allowed both the EU and NATO to complement the lessons learned from their actual co-operation on the EU-led Operation Concordia in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a view to further enhancing their concerted contribution to international peace and stability.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	616	Personal injury claims against the Minister for Defence encompass a wide variety of situations. The Defence Forces and civilian employees are engaged in a variety of workshops and barracks. There is a large fleet of vehicles on the road almost 365 days a year. In addition, the Army, Navy and Air Corps are engaged in training exercises and operational and overseas commitments. The €25 million was paid out over a five year period in respect of a wide-ranging number of claims covering incidents relating to all of the above.I am concerned to ensure that such claims are kept to a minimum and that when they do arise they are dealt with expeditiously and efficiently. It was for this purpose that the Government established the State Claims Agency which formally took charge of its new responsibilities on 3 December 2001, with the resources necessary to dispose of claims against Departments as cost-effectively as possible. To date, I have referred 344 cases for the attention of the agency, 74 of which have been settled. Some 507 cases remain to be disposed by my Department including claims predating the State Claims Agency and in certain categories not encompassed in the agency's brief.The agency also has a role in the overseeing of risk management. A working committee comprising military personnel, representatives from the State Claims Agency and Department officials, has been established to examine incidents giving rise to claims and trends emerging in order to identify and obviate, if possible, the underlying causes of injury to civilian and Defence Forces personnel.

The barracks in question are located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.The sale of approximately 91 acres comprising Lot 1, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, to O'Flynn Construction for €41 million has been completed. In addition, the sale of Lot 2 to the sitting tenant for €1.05 million – my Department's reversionary interest in approximately 6.2 acres of the barrack lands – has also been completed. A further area comprising more than 27 acres at Murphy Barracks will be handed over to Cork County Council for community use.Some 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, were sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for €973,889 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney Military Post, Monaghan, comprising approximately ten acres, was sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for €761,843. A total of seven acres at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for €8,888,167. The balance of barracks lands, one acre, was sold to Kildare County Council for €380,921.Magee Barracks, Kildare, comprises an area of 65 acres. Currently, approximately 15 acres of the property are being used by the reception and integration agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and a further site comprising approximately one acre is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site for 20 persons.The Government on 1 July 2003 decided to release this property to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for inclusion in a new affordable housing initiative agreed under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.My Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising 13.65 acres approximately.

I am advised by the military authorities that state-of-the-art communications facilities are provided for all Defence Forces missions overseas. In their operational role, the Defence Forces are equipped with modern digital tactical radios for short range and long range communications. These allow the headquarters maintain contact with personnel on the ground.

In addition, for patrolling in areas of doubtful normal radio communications, two types of satellite links are provided viz. Iridium handheld phones which provide voice facilities and which have been proven by Defence Forces personnel worldwide on other missions and Inmarsat satellite C, fitted to a vehicle and which provides data capabilities worldwide.Voice and data facilities, Defence Forces internal e-mail, are available for operational use at any time. These facilities allow communications between the headquarters in the mission area and Defence Forces headquarters. In addition, telephone access is provided, at less than local Irish tariff rates, to personnel to contact their families and friends.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	649	My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.I recognise the importance of early intervention as a means of preventing future educational disadvantage and at pre-school level my Department continues to support a number of early intervention programmes, including the early start project and the Rutland St. pre-school project, which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage.At primary school level, my Department has a number of programmes in place to counter educational disadvantage such as the early start pre-school programme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home school liaison scheme, Breaking the Cycle and the giving children an even break, GCEB, programme and a specific pilot project aimed at tackling disruptive behaviour, namely, the support teacher project which has 41 support teachers in 47 selected primary schools since 1995. The support teacher has a specific role in supporting the development of school policy on children's behaviours and formulating management strategies for the support of children experiencing behavioural difficulties.All second level schools which have been designated as disadvantaged receive concessionary teacher post allocations. Such schools are also allocated additional resources to facilitate their participation in the home school community liaison scheme. Over 200 schools are involved in the scheme at present.The school completion programme provides a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. My Department also allocates resource teacher support and special needs assistant support to primary, second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for students with special educational needs, including students suffering from emotional or behavioural disturbance. The National Educational Psychological Service is also available as a support service to schools for individual students who encounter difficulties.

The grants for the 2001-02 school year have been paid to schools. Payments under the agreed scheme for substitution and supervision for the 2001-02 school year have been finalised.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	651	In 2002, my Department introduced the school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and significantly expanded programme to deal with early school leaving, incorporating the learning, experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives, namely the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and stay in school retention initiative at second level, SSRI.Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. This is the approach my Department is now taking to address the problem of early school leaving, which replaces the previous process of funding individual second level schools under the stay in school retention initiative. A total of 82 projects are currently supported and the remaining 53 SSRI schools not originally selected for the project strand are supported on a phasing out basis under the school completion programme.My Department is currently considering the inclusion of further schools in the project strand of the school completion programme. Some of the remaining 53 SSRI schools could qualify for inclusion in the project strand and they will be notified of the outcome as soon as the process has been completed.

The need for the level of support sanctioned should be reviewed periodically in the context of a pupil's emerging needs.In September 2003, my Department issued circular 24/03 to all primary schools. This circular contained advice to schools as to how applications for special educational needs, SEN, support such as that described by the Deputy might be dealt with. The circular also clarified the flexibility that schools could employ in the most effective deployment of SEN resources. Should the Deputy have a specific case in mind and wishes my Department to examine it, he might provide details to the special education section of my Department.

This year, I provided further funding sufficient to provide for the advancement of the planning of the proposal as requested by Louth County Council. The council has engaged the services of consulting engineers to undertake the necessary preparatory work, including the carrying out of the required environmental impact assessment and completing documentation to secure a foreshore lease and planning permission.I indicated that funding for the advancement of the project would be the subject of further consideration next year and that, while I could not guarantee funding for the new pier development, I am anxious for the council to be prepared so it could act immediately should funding be available. In addition, I recently made funds available for the provision of a crane and handrails at the pier.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I am informed by the director general of the Prison Service that the Prison Service has a general rule that prisoners should be handcuffed when being removed from the court precincts. This rule obtains because of the high number of incidents involving prisoners, including injuries to staff and escape, when there was a lower usage of handcuffs in the past. Governors and prison staff, where this is considered appropriate, are allowed some discretion particularly in regard to women and aged or infirm prisoners who pose a low flight risk. The nature of the crime for which a prisoner is sentenced is not a factor in their treatment by prison staff.The exercise of discretion can vary in the light of the different settings in which prisoners are tried, for example, the Four Courts complex is a difficult setting where hundreds of persons can be committed to custody on a particular day. For this reason, the Cloverhill escort party who service the Four Courts invariably handcuff all prisoners and there is a governor's order from the institution directing staff to take that approach. On the other hand a wider discretion is exercised by other prisons servicing smaller court venues where the number of prisoners and prevailing risk factors are considerably lower.The director general of the Prison Service has advised me that prison staff are required to respect the dignity of all prisoners in their charge at all times. Moreover, prison rules explicitly require the authorities to avoid prisoners being photographed. The Prison Service does not endorse or encourage the "parading" of prisoners in a way which impinges on their personal dignity – regardless of their crimes or alleged crimes. Prisoners are brought to court early when possible to avoid exposure and underground exits and closed yards are used where they exist. However, despite the best efforts of staff, there are real and practical difficulties in removing prisoners from most of the older court precincts where there is no screened exit away from public view or photographers. There can be some distance to be travelled in terms of public access between the courtroom and the nearest parking space for the prison van which can be out on the public road.The facilitation of less high visibility entrances and exits by prisoners before the courts will be considered by the Court Service in the design of any new court complexes.I want to assure the Deputy that it is in no way part of the delivery of justice to seek to humiliate people who are or have been before the courts however serious their crimes or whatever vicarious satisfaction some people may derive from seeing them in handcuffs.

The common recruitment pool system is specifically addressed by Sustaining Progress which provides that the parties will conduct a cross-sectoral review of recruitment issues pertinent to the relevant grades, including greater accessibility and the introduction of a graduate entry level. This review is under way.

However, I understand that Drogheda Borough Council, in association with Louth County Council and Meath County Council, is in the process of commissioning a planning strategy for Drogheda, east Meath and south Louth. Further details may be obtained from the borough council.

The timescale for the approval of particular stages of water services projects by my Department is dictated by competing demands on the Department's technical staff and on the scheduling of individual schemes within the overall water services investment programme.Significant elements of the scheme as proposed are intended to service future development requirements. In accordance with the Government's water services pricing policy framework, the marginal capital costs relating to these elements will have to be recovered by Donegal County Council from the non-domestic sector. An updated water pricing report has been requested by my Department from the county council, and is awaited, to allow the economic viability of these elements of the scheme to be determined in accordance with current water services pricing policy.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-04 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The Government's strategy on housing has the central aim of enabling every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The general strategy for realising the overall policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves, with the aid of the fiscal incentives available, and that those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing. Existing legislation and funding programmes support this strategy.Consequently, the Government believes that it would be inappropriate to legislate for a specific right to housing, as suggested by the campaign, on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions on the allocation of financial resources is a matter for the democratically accountable Government.Within the current legislative framework, the Government has been able to place a strong focus on assisting homeless households in recent years. According to the assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities in March 2002, there were a total of 3,773 homeless households in the country at the time of assessment compared to 3,743 households in 1999. The vast majority of these were in homeless accommodation ranging from emergency to long-term supported housing rather than on the streets.As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities, together with health boards and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. A wide range of additional accommodation has been provided, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless offenders have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans.

This sum provided for monthly payments in respect of an average of 1,028,000 children.The indications now, as we near the end of the year, are that the original Estimate is likely to be inadequate. The precise amount of the shortfall will not be known until after the close of the year. The figure is estimated at €42.5 million and this is the sum included in the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.

The scheme is not intended to be a long-term solution in any individual case.My Department has overall responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which provides assistance to people experiencing indebtedness. There are 52 independent companies nation wide operating the service.The key feature of the MABS programme is the provision of money advice, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling.In 2003 I have provided €9.9 million for the operation of the MABS service. The latest information available from the companies providing the service shows that some 12,000 people are availing of the service.

PRSI contributions are collected through the PAYE system and there is a timelag between the end of any income tax year and the information on PRSI contributions becoming available.The change in the income tax year from January 2002 has increased the effective timelag between payment of contributions and eligibility for benefit.I have asked my Department to review the arrangements to see whether changes in the eligibility criteria for determining entitlement to benefit are possible or desirable at this point in the light of the new tax year arrangements.
