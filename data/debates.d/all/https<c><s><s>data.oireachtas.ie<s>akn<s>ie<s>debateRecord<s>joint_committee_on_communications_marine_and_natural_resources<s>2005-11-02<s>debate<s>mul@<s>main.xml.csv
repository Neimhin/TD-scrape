#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The joint committee resumes its energy modules with a review of energy today. While it was indicated on the agenda that we would receive a presentation from Professor Mark O'Malley of UCD, a member of the renewable strategy group, the professor cannot attend due to other commitments. Today's agenda is still a full one, however. The committee will hear from Dr. Brian Ó Gallachóir of UCC on energy policy development with reference to wave energy, wind forecasting, energy in buildings, biofuels, transport and photovoltaics. We will also hear from Mr. Martin Howley of Sustainable Energy Ireland and author of Energy in Ireland and, in the afternoon, from IBEC whose representatives will make a presentation on energy issues for Irish industry. The IBEC presentation will be followed by one from the ESB.In early September, a delegation from the joint committee visited UCC to see at first hand the very valuable work taking place at the institution. The presentation to the delegation on wave energy was especially informative, interesting and educational for those of us who attended. I am delighted Dr. Brian Ó Gallachóir will make a presentation to the joint committee. What we will hear will be of vital importance in compiling a report on energy which we hope to publish in the next few months. We will hear a short presentation approximately ten minutes long which will be followed by a question and answer session. I draw everybody's attention to the fact that while members of the committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not extend to witnesses appearing before the committee which cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it. Furthermore, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	During the course of the presentation I will provide an overview of the research being carried out in UCC on sustainable energy. We have been active in this field since the late 1970s and have over 25 years of research under our belt. Initially, we researched areas such as wave energy, hydropower and photovoltiacs and, more recently, geothermal energy in buildings, energy performance of buildings, wind power and energy policy research. We are working collaboratively with Cork Institute of Technology on biofuels for transport.The research is informed by our current situation. Essentially, Ireland has a 58% dependence on imported oil; 2% of our energy comes from renewables. Overall, we have a high level of import dependency and a strong dependence on fossil fuels. Where UCC sees its strength, in terms of research, is in the breadth and depth of its focus. Research is focused on energy supply, wind, the oceans and photovoltaics and the end use of energy, 40% of which occurs in the area of transport. Another 40% is used in buildings. We concentrate our research on these two key end use sectors. We also carry out energy trends analysis and policy research.Wind energy can be produced in Ireland cheaper than the best new entrant into the electricity market, as calculated for the energy regulator. However, there are two main challenges associated with increasing the amount of wind energy on the system. It is not accurately predictable when wind energy will be available and, equally important, when it will not be. Even if it were predictable, wind energy is still variable. This creates a challenge in trying to integrate increasing amounts of wind energy on the system. The challenge is particularly apparent in Ireland because of our weak level of interconnection in comparison with that in countries such as Denmark where there is a much higher level of penetration but it has a strong interconnection with the Nordpoolelectricity grid. We are working with ESB National Grid in a project supported by SEI on developing a wind energy forecasting system for Ireland.The graph shows how the work developed in UCC is in the process of being implemented in Denmark. The error in wind energy prediction is mostly in the numerical weather prediction model, that is, predicting the weather. Our focus has been on trying to improve the accuracy of weather prediction models in a way that makes them suitable for wind energy forecasting. Quantifyng the uncertainty is as important as improving the accuracy. The graph on the slide shows that at certain times the band of forecasts is very narrow, which indicates a high level of certainty in the forecast. At other times, depending on the weather system coming in, it is very difficult to predict what the amount of wind energy will be. It is important to be able to quantify this for system operators in order that they can accommodate increased amounts of wind energy.The second aspect of wind energy relates to variability. Addressing this can be done in a number of ways and depends on the level of interconnection and the flexibility of other plant on the system. The work on which we are focusing is energy storage. We have been involved in an EU project looking at wind hydrogen systems in which one uses wind energy to produce hydrogen. Essentially, one stores the energy in the wind as hydrogen in order that it can be used later either to produce electricity or as a transport fuel.Turning to page 4 of the presentation, another of the key supply areas is wave energy. In a sense, wave energy can be viewed as a concentrated form of wind energy. Ireland has a significant resource. Wave energy capacity is shown in comparison with what is currently available on the Irish system. In theory, the whole coastline could provide 48 Terawatt-hours of energy. Taking the theoretical available amount of wave energy it is necessary to see what would be constrained by physical infrastructure, as well as the grid infrastructure. Members should see on the slide the reference to a quantified amount of 2.5 Terawatt-hours in the medium term.Page 5 indicates that the work on wave energy is carried out in the hydraulics and maritime research centre within UCC. Based on some recent work, it suggests a target for Ireland of up to 80 MW to be installed by 2012 and after 2012, installation of 20 MW per year. The focus in wave energy is twofold; meeting our own targets in renewable energy and also our commitments on climate change under the Kyoto Protocol. It can also be viewed as a starting point for an industry in technical development that can be exported. The world market is estimated to be worth in excess of €50 billion according to the DTI in the United Kindgdom. Therefore, it is a potentially significant market that Ireland can have a role in supplying.The third aspect of energy supply is covered on page 6. This is an area in which our president in UCC has a long standing interest and involvement and is carried out in the  Tyndall Institute in Cork. Work is being done on thermophotovoltaic solar cells and also minitiaturised solar cells for ambient light harvesting. A number of key areas are concentrated on within photovoltaics. An example is given on page 7 of one of the thermophotovoltaic projects under way in UCC.Moving on to energy use in buildings, much of this relates to the EU buildings directive on how to actually assess the energy performance of buildings. A sample energy certificate or label is shown at the bottom of the slide which we are used to seeing on appliances. Essentially, what the directive will bring is a labelling system for buildings. The next page of the presentation shows that what we are focusing on in UCC is measuring the energy performance of buildings.We are very fortunate to have some interesting case studies. The group has access to the energy, temperature and air circulation data for theMardyke sports arena in Cork. It can use this information to test its performance simulation models to ascertain how they can be validated and improved. Page 8 of the presentation contains a photograph of the Glucksman art gallery, an example of a building with a different function and purpose. An important part of the group's work is its assessment of the energy performance of a number of building types.Page 9 of the presentation relates to energy and transport and contains a sketch from the Toyota hybrid system. UCC's department of electronic engineering is doing some work on power systems conversion. Details of a different type of fuel system for cars, based on biogas and compressed natural gas, are outlined at the bottom of the page. The research group is trying to bring its strengths in the areas of electrical engineering and system analysis to the energy problems and challenges faced by Ireland.An explanation of how biogas can come from waste and be used as a fuel in transport is cited on page 10 of the presentation. The group is developing a biofuels project in collaboration with Cork Institute of Technology, the Economic and Social Research Institute and Teagasc. It is drawing up a road map of Ireland's progress in this area between 2010 and 2020. It is determining whether there is potential for indigenous biofuels production and examining how such biofuels compare with imported biofuels.Page 11 of the presentation relates to energy policy, the final area of the group's research. The group provides external support for Sustainable Energy Ireland by analysing energy trends. It investigates the technological and policy barriers to sustainable energy. It examines the conflicts between the various pillars of energy policy — cost competitiveness, environmental responsibility and security of supply. The project examines how a mechanism in place in Spain to support wind energy might be applied in the Irish context. It has considered the revenues which could be received for wind farms which are supported in Ireland with an adapted version of the Spanish mechanism.The research group's work with Garrad Hassan on behalf of the regulators on both sides of the Border is outlined on page 12 of the presentation. The work involved an examination of the future of wind energy production and its limits as a system. We tried to determine the point at which wind energy would need to be curtailed and the impact of such a curtailment. The research group has been monitoring the progress made in the achievement of wind energy targets. Members can note the various rates of success in this regard on the bottom of page 12. The AER I programme had a 153% success rate, whereas the most recent competition, AER VI, had a success rate of 10% at the end of 2004. The book has not yet been closed on AER VI projects. This country has not yet managed to deliver on the targets as they have become more ambitious. While it has delivered least-cost energy, it has not delivered on the targets set down.Page 13 of the presentation relates to some work the research group did with the energy economics group in Vienna University of Technology. I have examined the targets set for 2010 and 2020. The presentation provides a glimpse of the circumstances which would obtain if we were to put in place a target of 20% of electricity originating from renewable sources by 2020. For example, it examines the cost of meeting such a target when compared to the cheapest alternative or the market price for electricity. It also outlines how the short-term 2010 target of 13.2%, our obligation under the directive, compares with a more ambitious 2010 target of 15%. The output of the analysis showed that setting a higher short-term target reduced the costs of meeting a longer-term target. This is to do with learning curves and the stage at which new technologies are introduced.The final slide on page 13 shows another area we have been examining with Bord Gáis, the security of gas supply. Security of energy supply has a different meaning for people. There are different ways of measuring and examining it in price and risk in terms of what may happen. Are we talking about disruption of supply or a significant increase in price, as we saw recently with oil prices? Our work focused on disruption of gas supply to discover where the weak points were on the network. It pointed to the 50 kilometre single line stretch on the Scottish mainland from which the supply to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland emanates. This is in addition to our indigenous supply from the Kinsale and Corrib gas fields.In its research UCC has always been anxious to engage in the policy development process. Committee members can see on page 14 a list of the review groups and panels on which we are represented in the effort to move forward on renewable and sustainable energy sources during the past ten years, both in national fora and the European Union context.The last slide shows a poster from our recently launched Master's programme. We are conscious that, as well as carrying out research, we should try to train engineers to deliver and respond positively in the workplace to the challenges facing us. We have a one-year taught Master's programme to equip engineers with some of the information techniques and skills associated with sustainable energy. I hope this brief presentation has provided a glimpse of the areas we cover and the breadth of what is involved.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank Mr. Ó Gallachóir.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I compliment Mr. ÓGallachóir on his presentation and the research work he and his colleagues have been doing. This area needs that level of dedication and more. Changing energy requirements here mean much more time and money will have to be spent on research and development in respect of alternative energy sources. I am glad this is being done in a few places. I congratulate UCC for the work it is doing.The slide on page 9 suggests the use of alternative or combined fuels in motor cars. I am concerned about the safety factor, something about which many questions have been asked. I am concerned about the use of compressed gas under the floor of a car. How safe is this?Another question I have concerns wind energy grid dependability, to which Mr. Ó Gallachóir referred. The ESB, for example, has a particular view on this, which is understandable as it is responsible for delivering power to the community. The extent of the grid's dependence on wind generated electricity has to be conditioned by the degree to which the wind is blowing. What are the possibilities for research into storage or the obvious alternative of a second interconnector in order that energy supplies can be sold when the wind is blowing strongly and bought back when it is blowing elsewhere? Has there been sufficient investigation into the possibility of providing a second interconnector to achieve a situation where we could reasonably expect to have continuity of supply, even with the present increased industrial and domestic requirements? We must keep in mind at all times that industrial and domestic requirements will continue to grow. Against this background, I want to ask the degree to which we compare with the leading producers, of wind energy in particular, in other European countries.My last point relates to wave or current energy. The work Dr. Ó Gallachóir is doing with his colleagues in Cork is very interesting. This area will require special attention from now on, given the huge resource implicit in it and that, generally, it would be environmentally friendly in terms of visual impact and potentially offers a great return.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On the issue of safety, this is of key concern, not only with CNG but also with hydrogen. Essentially, as with any technical development, it has to be and should be a key concern. If safety is at risk, it is unsustainable. A lot of work is being carried out.On the dependability of the grid within the context of increasing wind energy penetration, storage is an issue very close to our hearts in UCC. We have done a desk review, looking at all the storage technologies available and narrowing them down to the ones which might be the most applicable to wind energy and to dealing with the specific issue of addressing intermittency in wind energy, and then looking further within the context of what would be suitable in Ireland. We are developing proposals to look at two possible storage technologies. A number of options are available, some of which are at different stages of development.I mentioned hydrogen technology which we have looked at in terms of a desk modelling exercise. Within this area there is a lot of research being done on fuel cells and electrolysis for producing hydrogen. We believe it is more suitable to start with technologies that essentially can be taken off the shelf to test how they would work in addressing wind energy intermittency to reduce the level of technical risk. Our focus is on looking at small-scale pumped hydro systems and battery storage. A particular battery is being used in Japan for dealing with day-night variations to provide an uninterrupted power supply. We are discussing with the ESB the possibility of testing this in the Irish context to see how it might complement wind energy sources.As regards the interconnector, there is a benefit to be gained in addressing wind energy intermittency associated with interconnection. That is why countries such as Denmark can achieve such high rates of penetration without having to face some of the issues we face. However, the interconnector does not offer the total solution. One of the issues associated with it is which way the electricity will flow. The price of electricity in Britain is lower than here. Therefore, one could have a situation where electricity produced in Britain could be offered at cheaper prices to Irish consumers.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There are a number of reasons, including the size of the market, the type of plants and the system.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There are a number of key factors. There is also over-capacity which increases the level of competition. We are in a different position in terms of the capacity available.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Is Dr. Ó Gallachóir saying the interconnector in an all-island market means we should have cheaper electricity prices?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Does the Deputy mean the interconnector with Britain or with Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland has higher electricity prices than the Republic?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	11	What about the two islands?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	12	If there was an all-island UK and Ireland electricity market, there would be cheaper electricity prices in Ireland. There is also the issue of the purpose for which the interconnector is used and how it may be utilised to deal with wind energy intermittency.Wave energy offers significant potential in the Irish context. Because commercial devices have not yet been developed, it is still at that stage where there are opportunities which we do not have with wind energy such as developing technologies which are exportable. As regards wind energy, much of the technical development has taken place, but there are still issues associated with grid integration which will face Ireland sooner than other countries because of the island nature of the electricity network. We are learning things and this knowledge is exportable. I gave the example of forecasting. The findings of work we are doing in UCC are now being implemented in Denmark. As regards wave energy, because commercial devices are not yet available, there is a range of other opportunities associated with the market as it grows.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I apologise for being late. My energy levels were at a low ebb this morning.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	We will not ask the Senator to explain.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I appreciate that.Perhaps I am being parochial, but one of the first slides shows Errigal mountain with the name "Ó Gallachóir" beside it. Perhaps Dr. ÓGallachóir has a link with County Donegal, although his accent does not suggest this.As regards the technology required for wave energy, I do not know how it operates. There have been difficulties in County Donegal in getting planning permission for wind turbines. There has been trouble, although there have been positive developments in terms of the use of wind turbines.Would an issue arise in terms of the technology used to produce wave energy? Dr. Ó Gallachóir has outlined the economic benefits of wave energy. However, would it have an environmental impact on our beaches? Is it necessary for wave energy devices to be located on beaches? I ask Dr. Ó Gallachóir to outline the practicalities and the technological requirements in respect of wave energy. I notice from the submission that we are in a K4 region. Are there differences among various areas of the country? Would the Donegal coast, for example, have better potential than other parts of the country?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	16	No, these are indications of where we have a measurement of wave energy potential. It can be seen that two areas, K2 and Pembroke are circled. The graph shows that they follow the same trace but that they do so with a time delay. If the measurements are taken from the outer buoys, such as K2, K3 and K4, by the time that wave energy comes ashore we have a good idea what it is. So it is a more predictable form of energy than that generated by wind. That was the point of the slide.In response to the question on technology vis-à-vis planning issues, currently the devices being developed are suitable for onshore or near-shore use. This is due to the challenge of moving into the far offshore environment, which is a similar challenge to the one faced by wind energy. They are classified as first, second and third generation devices. They typically move further offshore as the research and technology improves. In terms of environmental impact, if the wave energy device does its job, it will take as much of the energy out of the waves as possible. However, as a stretch far offshore would typically be involved, the effect it would have on the inshore coastline would be minimal. If anything, it could, in a simplistic way, be beneficial in that it would reduce coastal erosion. However, the impact would not be significant.If we move offshore, the challenge would be to get the electricity onshore. The research group has found that some of the areas that are best for wave energy along the coast also coincide with areas weakly served by the electricity network. This is one of the major challenges associated with wave energy. We have the same issue with wind energy. As the Senator mentioned, Donegal is a very good site from a wind energy perspective. However, the strength of the electricity network in some parts makes it difficult to harness that energy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I apologise for missing the earlier part of the presentation. The kind of industry, fabrication, etc., as well as research and development required to achieve a serious target in wave energy, involved are outlined on page 5 of the submission. Are there costs in terms of the energy consumed etc.? Dr. Ó Gallachóir has said that Ireland is in a unique position vis-à-vis many other EU countries. What kinds of supports would be required to get up to 80 MW by 2012? What would it entail, who would accomplish it and how would the necessary conditions be created? How does it compare to wind power which, despite the problems we have had with the AER process, is at least up and running?The British Government today announced a major programme for microgeneration. I note the reference in Dr. Ó Gallachóir's document to the Mardyke sports arena at UCC and the Glucksman art gallery, though I missed that part of his presentation. Did he refer to microgeneration projects in the context of those buildings and does he see much scope for the different elements of a microgeneration approach through which companies and householders could be encouraged to begin to provide for their energy needs using certain technologies? I thank Dr. Ó Gallachóir for his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	18	A significant investment is required in wave energy to achieve our goals. It is a question of taking a decision — whether that decision is appropriate — to make a significant investment based on the size of the market and the potential to benefit from it. The bullet points on the first slide on page 5 of my submission indicate what other countries are beginning to do. Portugal is offering 23 cent per kilowatt hour, which is a significant sum per unit of electricity.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	19	There has yet to be a successful project though.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	20	While that is correct, the purpose of the concession is to send a strong signal that there is a market for projects which can come in. Part of the solution is to establish a market mechanism and framework which facilitates wave energy in the initial stages. By contrast, the UK offers 15 cent plus a capital grant, which is a mix of market supports. The capital grant is an up-front provision that is supported subsequently through a generous payment per unit of electricity delivered. What is initially required in the Irish context is a form of market mechanism that combines a generous tariff coupled with capital grant aid to support the construction phase. In addition, appropriate support should be provided at each stage of the development. This is part of what we hope to see emerge from a co-ordinated research strategy. Applied research, demonstration and market support are required. In the context of the Portuguese payment (23 cent per kilowatt hour for wave energy), it should be noted that Irish wind farms can be built where there is a provision of five cent to 5.5 cent per kilowatt hour. The difference is quite stark.The buildings are being wired to extract data from them to allow us to assess energy performance rather than to facilitate microgeneration specifically. While neither of the buildings at UCC have microgeneration, they have heat pumps which supply geothermal heat energy. One of the ideas we are exploring in the context of a new building, which is due to be opened soon to house the environmental research institute, is a hybrid renewable energy supply using wind and hydro power to provide electricity. Geothermal heat pumps and solar energy would provide the heat. The goal is to model the project in a way which assesses the building's energy performance and optimises supply to determine how the various renewable technologies can complement each other.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I must apologise as I was drawn away at the beginning of Dr. ÓGallachóir's presentation.I am particularly interested in wave energy. The fact that the whole coastline could provide 48 Terawatt-hours of energy is significantly encouraging, given that the alternative supply for the country is at the end of a gas pipeline running all the way from Siberia. If Dr. Ó Gallachóir does not mind, will he discuss some of the details? When he states the potential in the medium term is 5 Terawatt-hours, what is meant by the medium term? Why does he further say the potential in the technical medium-term is only 2.5 Terawatt-hours? What is limiting us in tapping some of this potential? When Dr. O Gallachóir states the whole coastline has the potential to provide 48 Terawatt-hours, I presume this is feasible in the long term and would not mean the energy from every single wave would have to be harvested? Surfers would be upset if we were to use every single wave. In ballpark terms what level of supply in Terawatt-hours could we expect in 2050, if we were to give an absolute commitment, with assisted capital grants, grid development and so on?I have seen an Airtricity presentation on grid connections for offshore wind farms where it is looking at the possibility of long-term development projects where a series of offshore wind farms would be connected together, in a herringbone type grid, which in a sense would have the potential to power Europe. If it were to run from the North Sea downwards, it would get us over the problem of inconsistency because in a grid of a certain length there would always be wind to power it. Would it be possible to connect wave power sources with such an offshore wind farm grid in the sense that it would have to have proper connections to national and the European grids? Would it offer potential for joining two renewable energy supply sources together in a large-scale long-term project to get over the problem of grid access and provide a complementary renewable energy system? Wave energy is slightly more reliable than wind energy. I imagine there is a delay from the time the wind blows as a cold front passes to creating energy. Wave energy is probably further delayed as it takes time for the energy to build. I would be interested in hearing Dr. Ó Gallachóir's views on this as a potential major long-term project.Has Dr. Ó Gallachoir information on what is happening in Scotland? I believe there is a research facility north of Edinburgh where significant research work is being done. Is there a danger that the Scots will be ahead of us in the technology field? If we were to say to SEI and the Department that large capital grants would be required for wave energy research, who would take them up? Do we know from experience that even where we have provided capital grants or research project funding that we lack the enterprise infrastructure for companies which would take them up? Would Dr. Ó Gallachóir have an indication as to who might introduce this technology? Are there engineering companies or is there an Irish skills base that would help to develop this technology, or would we be better off bringing in international companies and working on a partnership basis?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I will deal with the question of connection and grid infrastructure. Wave energy sources could certainly connect with infrastructure put in place to deliver wind energy supplies. There is very good complementarity between offshore wind energy and wave energy sources.In terms of quantifying the resource — that is, essentially, looking at how much wave energy would be available — it would not be feasible, particularly when one considers surfers, shipping lanes and various other matters, to connect the entire coastline. The purpose of the estimate was to give a sense of scale and an idea of the quantity, which is, roughly speaking, approximately twice what we currently use in electricity.The medium-term potential development is looking at a timeframe of 2020. The difference between the unconstrained and constrained is essentially the grid infrastructure at the coast. We end up with a technical medium-term potential of 2.5 terawatts which is, broadly speaking, approximately 10% of our current electricity requirements.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	23	On that basis, 2020 going forward would be the equivalent of 1990 going back. I clearly remember 1990. At present, we are investing significantly in our grid development. ESB National Grid has invested €4 billion in developing the grid. Based on what Dr. ÓGallachóir said, would it not make sense, in terms of existing constraints, to develop the grid from the coast back rather than from large gas power plants out, which appears to be the way the ESB is doing it? Given that wind and wave energy may be reliable future sources of power and that we are now estimating 15 years for a grid, surely that is a short-term approach? Are we investing the money wisely at present to harvest such power?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The current approach is based on anticipating where customers will be and then investing in the grid accordingly. In terms of investing in anticipation of supply being there, that is not currently a part of the framework or the decision-making around grid investment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Does Dr. Ó Gallachóir think we should switch to that form of thinking?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	There are signs that this is happening, in the sense that the approach now being taken is to connect the amount of wind that is currently queuing up to connect to the system. Roughly speaking, there is approximately 2,500 MW of wind in the queue waiting for grid connection. What ESB National Grid has done is taken a tranche of that and then grouped the potential projects in clusters. The ESB essentially feeds a spur into an area to support a cluster. That is a first-step approach to that kind of longer-term situation where one might see a strategic investment for the purposes of harvesting wave or wind energy into an area where the grid is weak.The other question Deputy Eamon Ryan asked was if the Scots are ahead of the game. In essence, the UK Government has provided a number of incentives, some of which are coming to fruition, in terms of demonstration projects around the Scottish coast. Companies here are actively pursuing the take-up of capital grants or support mechanisms. They are eagerly awaiting some form of support to deliver projects. I do not think that would be an issue. I imagine the way in which it would evolve would be as a competition. In that way, competitors from Ireland would compete with their international counterparts in terms of delivery.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	27	What percentage of UCC's energy comes from renewable sources?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It is very small at present. UCC's combined heat and power plant produces a form of energy that is sustainable in the sense that it is more efficient. However, it is based on gas rather than on a renewable source. When new buildings are being constructed at UCC, the university authorities are conscious of ensuring that they have state-of-the-art energy performance. The university is also integrating geothermal heat pumps into its buildings, where the necessary resource is available. As I mentioned earlier, some solar panels have been installed in the building that houses UCC's environmental research institute. While the percentage of the university's energy that comes from renewable sources is low, it is growing.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I presume Dr. Ó Gallachóir is aware that Dundalk Institute of Technology is producing a significant amount of energy from its own wind turbine.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Does UCC intend to take steps in that direction?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	32	As I said, the research group is engaged in a project aimed at developing a wind turbine and a hydro power plant to complement the thermal energy being provided. The proposed hybrid system will provide valuable research information and help to reduce UCC's emissions footprint.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is Dr. Ó Gallachóir aware that Cork City Council meets between 70% and 75% of its energy requirements from hydro turbines and methane gas from the city landfill?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Should State support for energy research and development concentrate on certain successful areas, such as wind energy and bioenergy? Should it focus on developing a small number of centres of excellence, rather than having them all over the country?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We need to decide on the priority research areas and the mechanisms that will be used to encourage, develop and enhance research. It is important to build on our existing strengths, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel in different places. We need to determine how this country's current strengths can be nurtured. However, I would not like potentially good research in certain locations to be stopped because our focus in this regard is too narrow.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Is State support for energy research and development adequate at present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	No. There is a low level of support for energy research and development at present, although it is planned to increase the level of support significantly and to ensure that it is more strategically co-ordinated. The UCC sustainable energy research group is looking forward to examining the detail of the proposals
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Have the proposals been made by the Department?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Does Dr. Ó Gallachóir believe Irish researchers are maximising the benefits of participation in EU programmes? Is the UCC group drawing down funding from various EU programmes?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Yes, it is availing of the benefits of a number of programmes. Improvements could be made in this area. It is difficult to develop a critical mass in the absence of an ambitious national programme. The level of uptake of EU funds will increase when a critical mass has been developed. One of the difficulties faced by Irish interests in the past, when they were focused on accessing EU funds, was that they had to seek international partners. That made it difficult for them to integrate and work more co-operatively with other institutions in Ireland. Irish bodies that are seeking funding are required to link up with EU partners, rather than with interests within this country.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I would like to ask about the research group's forecasting project in UCC. Have the Danish authorities purchased the project from the committee or are they running a similar project?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	44	No. Some of the people who were involved in the research, which was initiated and is continuing in UCC, have established a consultancy operation. They are selling the project to an interested party in Denmark.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	45	We saw how UCC carries out its forecasting. Is the project part-funded by the ESB?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Yes, the ESB is involved in the project.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Like anyone else, the ESB can read wind projections and then bid into the market. Would it have the benefit of UCC's research to do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	48	No. We work with ESB National Grid, the transmission system operator, which is currently responsible for ensuring that the lights remain on. If the wind is not available, it must also ensure that action is taken and that the other plant on the system is made available. The purpose of the collaboration is, essentially, to allow ESB National Grid to see the potential and then, in turn, to allow maximum penetration of wind energy on to the system.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	49	What about other operators? They would not have that benefit and would not know for what they could sell their energy into the market.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	50	We work with ESB National Grid, not ESB PowerGen. The latter would not, therefore, have any more information than other competitors in the market.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Is Dr. Ó Gallachóir saying he is of the view that it would not have more information?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I think it would not have it.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	In Dr. Ó Gallachóir's opinion, which is the better form of Government support, the AER process we use here or the ROCs process used in Northern Ireland? How can we create an all-Ireland energy policy with two such different support mechanisms from two different Governments?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In Ireland, the current short-term plan — involving feed in tariff — is very different from the ROC system. We have been looking at the Spanish support mechanism for wind. It provides two options, namely, a feed in tariff that would be equivalent to what is planned for the next AER or a market price for the electricity plus a fixed premium, which veers towards the ROC system but is not quite as risky. It is a type of bridge mechanism and we think there may be potential in it.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	55	If he had to choose, which option would Dr. Ó Gallachóir favour?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	56	At present, because of the level of competition within the electricity market, I am not sure a ROC system would work in the Irish context.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I thank Dr. Ó Gallachóir for his attendance. We have gone over time because of his interesting presentation. I thank him and his colleagues for making so much time and expertise available to the committee on its important fact-finding trip around the country. His staff put themselves out to accommodate us and we learned a lot about renewable and sustainable energies in UCC.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank the Chairman.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	59	From Sustainable Energy Ireland I welcome Mr. Martin Howley, author of Energy in Ireland, and Mr. Morgan Bazilian. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that, while members of the joint committee have absolute privilege, this privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee. The committee cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it. Furthermore, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.Before Mr. Howley begins, let me state that we exceeded the allocated time on the previous presentation because we found it extremely interesting. That is not to suggest that Mr.Howley's presentation will not be interesting. However, I would appreciate if the presentation were confined to ten minutes and then we will take questions because the members have other meetings they must attend before they return at 2.30 p.m. to hear presentations from IBEC and the ESB. Some of the other members have had to leave for other meetings.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I have provided two presentations. I will use the shorter one to keep the slide numbers synchronised. I head the energy policy statistical support unit of Sustainable Energy Ireland. We are based in Cork and we have a staff of three. Our purpose is to collect and publish energy statistics. We gather energy statistics from the main energy suppliers and we conduct small surveys of renewables and CHP. From these we produce the national energy balance and satisfy Ireland's reporting obligations in regard to energy to IEA, EUROSTAT, UNFCCC and EPA for the calculation of the inventory. We conduct analyses on the data and produce a range of reports which some of the members have, including Energy in Ireland and sectoral reports. We try to develop energy statistics and work closely with the CSO. We sit on the EUROSTAT energy committee, the IEA committee and the Odyssey network, which tries to develop energy indicators.When I show the third slide on economic growth, CO2 and emissions growth at international fora, there is usually a gasp when they see the growth of GDP. What I want to draw attention to is that since 2001 there has been a step-change. In the following three years GDP increased by 15% but primary energy increased by only 1.8% and CO2 emissions fell by 4.4%. The main reasons for this are the developments in the electricity generating system and I will deal with those in more detail later.The next slide deals with the total primary energy requirement. This refers to the development of primary energy consumption in Ireland since 1990. Growth in energy consumption was 59% over that period whereas growth in GDP was 145%. We are producing far more for the amount of energy we are using. This graph shows that in 2004, 56% of our primary energy requirement came from oil.The following slide shows the energy flow in 2004. Normally, when we see an energy balance it appears as a table of figures and it is very hard to decipher so this is an attempt to put that into a meaningful format. The left-hand side shows energy inputs into Ireland and the right-hand side shows where that energy is used. Again we see the dominance of oil as an input. There are hydro and other renewables, which are the sum total of the renewables' input into the primary energy system in Ireland. One can see the scale of the problem in displacing the other fossil fuels. As regards output, 21% of energy is lost in the transformation process. The largest final consuming sector is transport, which has increased considerably over the period.The next slide concentrates on electricity generation. The inputs are on the left and the outputs are on the right. The inputs are dominated by natural gas. Some 47% of the energy inputs in 2004 came from natural gas. The slide also shows electricity imports and hydro, wind and landfill gas as the renewable inputs. Members can also see the vast amount of energy which is lost to the atmosphere. In 2004, this constituted 59% or almost two thirds of the energy lost. It is less than in previous years because there have been improvements in the efficiency of the system. That would have been put to good use in other countries that have district heating and CHP systems. As regards the consuming sectors, services is now the largest electricity consuming sector.The next slide shows the CO2 intensity of the electricity generated in Ireland. Members can see how it progressed since 1990 and how it has been decreasing. There has been an acceleration of that decrease in CO2 intensity since 2001. That happened in 2001 and 2002 with the coming on stream of new combined gas generating stations. That led to the increased efficiency of those stations and to the fuel mix changing to a higher share of gas, which is a lower CO2 fuel. However, the decrease in 2004 was due to a reduction in peat consumption in electricity generation with the closure of the old peat plants.Why are we concentrating on the carbon intensity of electricity? The next slide gives an example of industry. The different fuels used in industry are shown from the bottom up. Emissions from the fuels consumed by industry have remained relatively stable since 1990. That is despite the fact that industrial output has increased by approximately 230%. Industry is doing more for the same amount of energy. That is not necessarily energy efficiency. It has been brought about by structural changes in industry. We are moving away from low value added, high energy consuming industries to high value added, low energy consuming industries. Many structural changes are taking place and there is some energy efficiency. The blue part of the slide shows the upstream emissions caused by the demand for electricity in industry. It is almost the same amount of emissions again compared to all the other fuels.The next slide shows the emissions from transport, which have grown by 132% since 1990. GDP grew by approximately 140% and transport emissions grew by 132%. There is one for one growth in energy related transport emissions compared with economic growth. There is a direct coupling between the two. As regards the rate of change between petrol and diesel, petrol emissions grew by 84%, while those relating to diesel grew by 220%. Although cars contribute a great deal to the increase, the economy and transporting freight throughout the country, contrary to popular belief, contribute more. The business as usual projection for energy emissions from transport for 2010 is 180% above 1990 levels. We were already at 134% in 2004.The next two slides complete the sectoral view of energy. Services energy consumption is the second fastest growing sector in terms of energy. It grew by 75% over the period and, as can be seen, it is the highest electricity-consuming sector.The next slide shows residential energy consumption. The interesting point about this slide is the change in fuel mix from 1990 to 2004. A considerable amount of coal and peat, which have been replaced primarily by oil, to a greater extent, and gas was consumed in the early days. The number of households in that period increased by 43%, whereas energy consumption only increased by 33%. That was achieved because of an increase in the efficiency of uses of energy by moving away from open fires and back-boilers to higher efficiency oil and gas boilers.The next slide shows how high our import dependency is compared with the EU average. There is a slight dip in 2004, which is an anomaly created by changes in stock levels of peat. We are probably still at around the 89% or 90% level.The next slide deals with how change in energy costs affects industry. This analysis was carried out in conjunction with the CSO. We obtained access to the anonymised micro-data of the 2001 census of industrial production of approximately 4,800 enterprises. For each enterprise we calculated the ratio of total energy costs to their total costs. We rank ordered them, as members will see from the slide. The green trace rank orders them from the smallest ratio to the highest. We drew a line at 5%. So enterprises that spent less than 5% of their costs on energy are below——
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	What is it called?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	It is called "energy expenditure over direct cost" and is built up over three sections. Just under 96% of enterprises spend less than 5% of their costs on energy. We then considered where those enterprises were in the context of the entire industry. We also summed up the level of gross added value, the output they generate, which, in effect, is the value they create for the economy. Those 96% of enterprises generate 97.2% of all industry gross added value.The next slide considers what proportion of energy-related CO2 those enterprises accounted for. This came in at 61%. So the corollary is that 4% of enterprises generate 39% of all industrial related CO2 emissions. Some 211 enterprises, or 4%, have costs in excess of 5%. Just ten enterprises have an energy bill of greater than 20% of costs. These are the really heavily energy-intensive industries and they generate 18% of industry's energy-related emissions. They contribute 0.5% of gross added value and 0.5% of employment to put them in the context of the economy. The following slide gives a summary of those data in figures.The next slide deals with the renewable energy contribution to primary energy. Two figures are usually quoted for renewable energy. One relates to primary energy and the other to their contribution to electricity supply. This slide shows the contribution to primary energy, which reached 2.2% in 2004. It has been hovering around 2% since 1990. It is like hitting a moving target; as the amount of renewable energy increases so does the amount of primary energy being consumed in the country. Contrary to popular belief, the largest contributor to renewable energy is biomass. Much of the waste bark and other wood burnt in the board manufacturing industry represent the largest part of the renewable energy contribution to Ireland's energy supply.We have reached the second last slide, which relates to renewable energy's contribution to gross electricity consumption. The target figure in 2010 is 13.2%. In 2004 we reached 5.1%. The bulk of it up to now has been from hydro but one can see a small amount of landfill gas and wind has taken off in the last two years. The amount of electricity generated by wind in 2004 increased by 44% on the previous year, so there is a ramping up of wind generation. The last slide is a summary of what I have said.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I do not have a view. I do not have the current forecasts. Perhaps Mr. Bazilian could answer that question.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Is Mr. Howley finished his presentation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Can Mr. Bazilian answer that question? It is a reasonable question to ask somebody in the industry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I think the 13.2% target will be met by 2010. I believe we are on track to meet that target based on the work undertaken by the renewable energy development group in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which looked at the implementation programme from now until 2010.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Is Mr. Bazilian optimistic?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I am.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	We should get away from this target because it is limiting us in our thinking. We should be aiming for 20%. We already heard from Dr. Ó Gallachóir that we have some of the best wave conditions in the world.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	They have had enough heart attacks in the Department already.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	We should lead the world in this area. One of the problems is that the targets we set limit our ambitions. The work Mr. Howley is doing is some of the clearest, best presented, most useful and significant work I have seen in this field. The report from 2003 was remarkably good. It could feed into everything the committee and Department are doing. Mr. Howley and Mr. Bazilian are to be congratulated. The original report was based on 2003 figures but all the graphs have now been updated to 2004. I am full of admiration that they can present us with such up-to-date figures so soon after the end of that year. The report is to be commended in that regard. The work is of immense significance and importance.How is it possible to present such updated figures? The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, does not appear to be able to give me CO2 figures year on year. Its latest figures relate to 2003. How did Mr. Howley and Mr. Bazilian get the CO2 emissions from industry and so on when the EPA does not appear to be able to keep up to date? Is this information being shared? The reason I ask is that it could be useful in terms of setting national targets for a reduction in our CO2 emissions. For example, under a new post-Kyoto Agreement to 2020, if we have to set an annual reduction in our CO2 emissions, would it be possible to indicate last year's emissions in terms of meeting our target so that the Government could accordingly modify its policy on CO2 targets for the following year?It was stated that the reduction in energy use was primarily due to the switch to gas and combined cycle gas plants rather than oil or coal in electricity generation. Was it not also due to the closure of the two IFI plants and Irish Steel, which were three big energy users?My third question relates to a similar matter. Sustainable Energy Ireland has said that ten companies account for almost 20% of Ireland's carbon dioxide emissions. Can Mr. Howley indicate the sectors of industry in which the companies in question are involved?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	No.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	It is because the data was anonymised. Sustainable Energy Ireland does not have details of the companies in question.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Mr. Howley can share the questions with his colleague, Mr. Bazilian, if he likes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Deputy Ryan asked how Sustainable Energy Ireland can gather information so quickly. It gathers its primary data on a top-down basis. It does not gather it from individual industries or sectors of industry. It gathers it from the main energy suppliers, such as the electricity generators and the oil, gas and peat suppliers. It normally takes until about October for a fairly final set of figures to be received. That is why I can give the committee some figures. The figure I cited in respect of carbon dioxide is SEI's calculation of the level of carbon dioxide emanating from energy-related activities. The figure did not emerge from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has to gather a great deal of information from agricultural and forestry processes, etc. It takes a little more time for the EPA figure to become known. SEI shares its energy data with the EPA throughout the year, as it is being updated.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I would like to ask about Sustainable Energy Ireland's figure and to consider primary energy supply. This country's energy use accounts for some 66% of its overall emissions. That is very accurate. If one measures an oil tanker coming into Whiddy Harbour near Bantry, one will know exactly how much carbon dioxide is on board and will eventually be burnt over the following six months. The figures are very accurate because of the nature of the primary supply. Large volumes of energy supplies are distributed by a small number of suppliers. The level of accuracy is fairly reliable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The figures are quite close to the EPA's figures. There may be slight differences as a result of the significant places which we use in our emission factors, etc. The figures are the same, by and large. Deputy Ryan also asked about the reduction in energy use between 2001 and 2004. I accept that the closure of IFI and Irish Steel led to some reductions in energy consumption, but most of the overall reduction can be attributed to increases in energy efficiency. The overall reduction in energy consumption has been much broader than the reductions caused by the closure of the two companies in question.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Have the increases in energy efficiency referred to by Mr. Howley resulted from the operations of the combined cycle gas plants?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Yes. The increases can also be attributed to the increase in renewables. The increase in imports also helped to reduce the carbon dioxide figure for electricity.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	86	On the statistical analysis, Sustainable Energy Ireland has cited a figure for carbon dioxide reductions from carbon sequestration within forestry, etc. Having spoken to various scientists about this matter, it seems to me that they are looking at molecules and various grubby pieces of earth to see how the energy transfer takes place. No scientist has presented to me a clear analysis of the level or extent of sequestration that really occurs. How does Sustainable Energy Ireland compile its estimate of the level of sequestration? Do the figures come from the EPA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Yes, they come from the EPA. I think the analysis is done on the basis of modelling. I accept that it would be very difficult to measure it directly. It is possible to make assumptions about the volume of carbon dioxide that is sequestered on the basis of a measurement of the volume of wood produced. I would like to make a final point about the ten companies with the highest cost ratios. Strict confidentiality constraints were imposed on Sustainable Energy Ireland when it worked with the Central Statistics Office. It is likely that I would face legal problems if I were to reveal any details of the companies.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I will not push that. Can Mr. Howley give the committee details of the sectors of industry in which the companies operate?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I have a copy of a report produced by Sustainable Energy Ireland that contained some sectoral analysis. I think a copy of the report may have been circulated to the committee.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	We shall get that later.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	We only picked three sectors because it was quite detailed on account of the amount of analysis involved. We picked the sectors we thought were the highest energy consumers.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Would the energy policy, statistic and support unit be the equivalent of the Central Statistics Office in respect of energy? Does it just compile statistical data?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	93	No, we do a little more, including analysis on it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I started on the European international project called Odyssey, a project to develop energy indicators that would explain the development of energy consumption over time. We try to strip out the different effects, for example, structural and fuel mix effects, and try to discover the real energy efficiency. There was some frustration in getting proper statistics, so Dr. Brian Ó Gallachóir and I were tasked in the late 1990s to find someone to correct the energy statistics. We could not find anybody with the expertise to do it so we bit the bullet and took it on ourselves. We both gather statistics and produce analysis, through the report we produce, to support policy. We do not have the same status as the CSO in that when we look for information from energy suppliers, we do not have a legal basis for acquiring that information. They can refuse to give us the information.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Do they?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	They have refused on occasions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	99	It is quite co-operative, but since liberalisation the quantity of information we have received has reduced.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	101	It is because much of the information is classed as commercially sensitive.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Is it due to competition?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Yes.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	104	If that is the case, the statistical data Mr. Howley has presented is not the full indication of what is happening in the market.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	105	By and large, it is. Where we have difficulty is with some of the smaller suppliers, but we make estimations in their regard.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I have taken an interest in the area of wind energy and have serious questions with regard to the industry regulator, in particular with regard to delays on wind energy projects around the country. Nobody seems to have an overall view with regard to wind energy nor has there been any report on the 13.2% target. People know what is in Gate 1 and know what has been approved. Local authorities around the country have designated specific locations for wind energy projects and farmers seeking alternative income sources have been encouraged to invest in wind energy. However, one of my main criticisms is that people must submit applications at considerable expense to local authorities, but most of them will never be accommodated, even by 2010, because if we stick to the 13.2% target, it will be achieved with what is already in the system.Nobody has said stop the lights or that we have enough applications. Many people are being put to considerable expense and much lip service is paid to the notion of wind energy. However, the people who want to become involved and gain access to the national grid must face all sorts of impediments that work against them in the system. Quite often there is a financial inducement to a rural community of funding for it over a period of ten years——
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	107	That may be a question for policy makers. Mr. Howley gathers information and statistics.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Mr. Howley is a gatherer of information, but his colleague, Mr. Bazilian, put forward the point that he was optimistic the 13.2% target would be reached by 2010. I would love to share his optimism. As to incentivising it and expediting it, all I can see is procrastination on the issue. Given what we have seen to date, I do not share Mr. Bazilian's optimism.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Does Mr. Bazilian want to answer Deputy Finucane's question?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I do not want to answer for anyone else. There has been reasonable co-operation between the Government, the regulator, the ESB and the various stakeholders in committing to meeting the 2010 target. I agree there is an issue of optics at local level regarding planning authorities and local planning permission and what the targets and the national grid connections are to be, but I do not have a solution for that.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I agree with what Deputy Ryan said earlier about setting a target of13.2%. If we are serious about tackling emissions, a target of 13.2% should not have been struck. Why not aspire to what Denmark and other countries are achieving. The ESB keeps making excuses regarding the intermittent aspect of electricity. If other countries can overcome that, why can we not? Perhaps Mr. Bazilian does not want to comment on that either. I would not expect him to.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The only comment I would make is that there was a consultation on a 20:20 vision for renewable electricity. It outlined three different target levels — 15%, 20%, and 30% in 2020. It was delivered as a consultation document. That is an ongoing discussion. It outlined different targets and also resources and a work programme to consider that. It is a live topic in the longer term.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Is that consultation document available?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	114	It is. It is on the Department's website
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It seems evident from Sustainable Energy Ireland's data that Ireland has become critically dependent on imported energy. Will Corrib gas improve the situation or is renewable energy the only option for us in the long term?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Both would improve the situation. They would both be indigenous sources of energy.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Is our dependency on imported hydrocarbons still as high as approximately 90%?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Mr. Howley spoke about the Ukraine pipeline a moment ago. What will happen if that is turned off and we cannot get imported fuel? What is the alternative? What should the country do, given the data Sustainable Energy Ireland has collected?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The dependence of the electricity system on gas is obvious. That would be very vulnerable. Many of those gas plants can run on oil. The difficulty would be in getting the oil to them on a continuous basis if what the Chairman suggested happens.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	121	There is so much here that would be affected. Let us return to the point I made regarding annual reductions we might need to make. There is a new European energy efficiency directive seeking a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020. On an annual basis that must be compounded at slightly less than 0.8% per annum. Can we simply measure what our primary energy requirement was and whether it is up or down by looking at the total primary energy requirement and the total primary energy supply? Would that be an effective way to measure energy efficiency or is that too simple an analysis?The figures are very interesting when one gets into the detail. The 2004 figures show that in the electricity fuel mix our use of fuel oil increased. Also in our total primary energy requirement our use of oil as a fuel supply again increased. It was approximately 56% in 2003. From how this is colour-coded, I presume it is slightly up on that. Can Mr. Howley explain that, given the price of oil is starting to rise so significantly? Has a facility such as Pigeon House switched to fuel oil for contractual reasons?I find it remarkable that in 2010 our energy use in transport will increase to 180% of what it was in 1990. That is equivalent to an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon a year — the emissions pumped out by two or three peat power stations — at a time when it is becoming increasingly expensive. How can the delegation predict that? Did it get those figures from the Department of Transport?As the delegation highlighted in the energy flow for 2004, the transformation loss in electricity generation equals the amount of energy we use in our homes. The delegation said that residential loss is 2,900 kilotonnes of oil equivalent and transmission loss is 2,960 kilotonnes. More wasted energy is going up the Pigeon House and Moneypoint chimneys into the atmosphere than we use in all our homes. That seems remarkable. Is that a fair summary?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	122	That is correct. We differ in Ireland in that almost all our electricity is generated by fossil fuels. We do not have district heating or nuclear energy and we have little CHP and hydro. Norway has 99% hydro, while Austria has approximately 60% hydro. All the Nordic countries have significant district heating plants where they generate electricity. They pipe the heat going up into the atmosphere around buildings to heat them. They have removed the need to use fossil fuels in those buildings.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Ringsend could be heated by the waste heat from the nearby chimney or Shannon could be heated by the heat from the chimney at Moneypoint.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Yes, but I suspect there would be many complaints about digging up the roads to do that. As regards the 2010 transport figure, that comes from the projections in the national climate change strategy.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Was that figure updated recently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I do not think so. It appears that more oil was consumed in electricity generation. I am not sure if that is related to the relative price of natural gas. If oil is used, it will generally be heavy fuel oil which has not gone up in price as quickly as distillate oils. Transport consumption has also increased, contributing to the increasing primary energy consumption of oil.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	If we want to achieve the EU energy efficiency target, should we examine the total primary energy supplied? One must take into account economic growth as a percentage of it. However, it seems to provide a fairly simple analysis of the energy used relative to economic output. Is that an easy measure or is it too simple?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I cannot remember whether I included a slide on the energy intensity of the economy in the presentation. That shows a continuous reduction in energy intensity and the energy consumed per unit of gross value added. That is not energy efficiency, but economic efficiency. It is brought about by the increasing value of goods, a change in the structure of the economy and a change in emphasis between the different sectors.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	129	What is energy efficiency?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Energy efficiency is reducing the amount of energy required to produce a certain product.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The EU directive has not been approved by the Council of Ministers but the process is under way. When it talks about a 20% increase or reduction in energy efficiency, what should we measure? Are we talking about a reduction in primary energy supply or a hypothetical use of energy to produce a certain level of economic activity?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Primary energy is affected by two factors: the amount of activity and the efficiency at which the energy is used to produce that activity. The Odyssey network tried to strip out the different effects, such as the structural and quantity effects, because if one produces things in more quantity, one will get economies of scale and reductions. One needs to strip out quantity, structural and fuel mix effects because different fuels will have different effects on how things are produced, leaving a residual, which is a pseudo efficiency. It is difficult at an economic level because one needs a lot of data to do it. We have the techniques but we have not got the level of detail in the data to give effect to those.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Will it be possible to do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	It probably will be possible in industry. However, it may be difficult in some other sectors.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	How does the European Union propose to measure it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	136	As it is an EU project, it may use that. The European Union has spoken to each sector about it but I do not know what the end result will be.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	137	That must be worked out before the directive comes into force.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Yes. However, there are other ways to do it, including from the bottom up. Companies in the large industry energy network, which Sustainable Energy Ireland supports, report increases in energy efficiency on a yearly basis. It may be possible to add it up on a bottom up basis.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	What happens if every household is using its kettle?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	One could probably look at the penetration of building regulations, energy consumption per household and climate correctives.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Did Mr. Howley say that heavy fuel oil prices have not increased significantly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I do not have the exact figures, but that is the case. It is a residual fuel and as one tries to get more diesel and petrol out of crude oil, it will be almost like waste. Its price has not gone up as it is not in demand as much as the other fuels.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Is that heavy fuel oil used to generate electricity?

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	If that is the case and if heavy crude oil, which is cheaper, is used to generate electricity, why have there been so many electricity price increases?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The ESB is constrained in the type of fuels it can use because of commitments on emissions.

If the price of that oil is cheaper than the price of an ordinary barrel of oil, does that mean that electricity charges should not be increased?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I cannot answer that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I said heavy fuel oil, not crude oil.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Are there any statistics? If the delegation does not have them today, perhaps it could send them to me.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I will send them to the committee.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	157	We might then be able to examine the differences.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	158	It may be a 5% or 10% increase in heavy fuel oil consumption. It will not be a huge change in share.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	159	It will be interesting for the committee to have that information.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	As regards conservation, given that the single biggest impact that can be made on imported fuel use comes from conservation and household insulation, has Sustainable Energy Ireland identified the extent of the savings? Some refer to savings of up to 22% or 23% and others refer to savings of 18%. I suppose it depends on the degree of efficiency that can be achieved. Has Sustainable Energy Ireland determined, in monetary terms, the benefit to the Exchequer from a 23% household energy saving? In an ordinary house with an open fire, for example, some 80% of the heat goes up the chimney. If this is converted to a boiler or a stove — depending on the model installed — 80% of the heat would come into the room with 20% going up the chimney. This represents one part. In addition, household insulation must have a huge impact through the elimination of draughts and keeping the cold out. I am looking for a money value in terms of oil, electricity, etc., saved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	161	This week I was trying to calculate the spend in the residential sector and came up with three different figures.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I thought I was going to get easy information.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	163	We believe it is approximately €2 billion per year split between electricity and other fuels. The Deputy referred to switching from an open fire to a boiler. It is not quite as simple as he outlined. A household which converts from an open fire to a central heating system may have a higher efficiency but it will also heat more of the house and provide a comfort effect. While there is a gain, it is not quite as much as might be expected.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	164	It is much easier to heat a house than to heat the whole neighbourhood.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I agree. However, it would normally take more than is used in the fire to heat the entire house in any event.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I thank Mr. Howley and Mr.Bazilian from Sustainable Energy Ireland for attending today. We will resume at 2.30 p.m. when we will hear first from IBEC and then from the ESB.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the representatives from IBEC, Mr. Brendan Butler, Mr. Donal Buckley and Mr. David Manning. I understand that they are accompanied by Mr. Dick Budden from Wellman, Mr. Bert-Ove Johansson from Boliden Tara Mines, Mr. Alan Buckley from Lisheen Mine, Mr. Colin Mills from BOC Gases and Mr. Patrick Dunne and Ms Karina Howley from Intel. We will hear from them about energy use issues for Irish industry. I do not doubt that the cost of electricity will be a feature in the next session with the ESB, for which the witnessed are welcome to stay.Before I ask Mr. Butler to begin, I advise everyone that there will be a short presentation which will be followed by a question and answer session. I draw attention to the fact that members of the committee have absolute privilege but that this same privilege does not extend to witnesses appearing before the committee. The committee cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it. Furthermore, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.As Mr. Butler may be aware, the work of the joint committee on the energy module has been interrupted to deal with more pressing matters in the Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resource. We have a very large brief and have been obliged to deal with salmon fishing and fishing in general, as well as issues of communications. We hope to complete the energy module and issue a report on our findings before the end of this year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	168	On behalf of IBEC, I welcome the opportunity to make a presentation to the joint committee. One or two of the company representatives accompanying us would like to provide personal perspectives on how energy costs are impacting on their businesses.There is a range of issues around the energy agenda. It cannot be denied that there has been a very significant increase in international commodity prices, particularly in the past 12 to 18 months. With regard to the problems besetting the energy sector, we operate in an environment where we have had 25 years of under-investment in energy infrastructure. While there is now a very significant spend of €3.5 billion on such infrastructure, we are very much in a catch-up phase. Also, unlike many sectors of Irish industry, although it is a critical part of the Irish industrial base, there is no energy policy.The other issues driving development are market liberalisation and deregulation of the energy market. As to where we stand on energy prices, Ireland has the highest electricity prices for industrial users not only in Europe but throughout many other developed economies with which we compete on a daily basis. The charts we have presented graphically demonstrate that Ireland is the leader in that regard. According to EUROSTAT, Ireland is 31% ahead of the EU average for energy costs. In 2000 and 2001 we were almost level with the EU average, but in the past four years we have moved to a position where we are 31% above the EU average.

Does this analysis take in small to medium users which might be on different tariffs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	172	It takes in medium to large users.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Does it take into consideration those which are on different tariffs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	174	They are not all on the same tariff. This reflects the heavy energy users.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Those figures are produced in January.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	These are the latest EUROSTAT figures available. We took them from the annual report of the National Competitiveness Council which was published last month.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We read the EUROSTAT website in the House and, as far as I am aware, there is at least a six-monthly quadrant. I am not sure, therefore, how these figures could be accurate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	182	They are the latest available figures that we have.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	183	To what month do they refer?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	January 2005.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Mr. Butler may proceed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	186	There have been increases in gas prices internationally. There is also a very significant investment in infrastructure. The tariff structure for gas is very complex and inflexible. This is causing problems, for the heavy energy users in particular. At a minimum, gas users are facing an increase of 25% from 1 January 2006. Gas prices do not compare with electricity prices when benchmarked. Gas prices are more towards the average, but we have moved from a position three or four years ago where we had the lowest prices in Europe. We are now in the middle. This does not include the 25% increase due in January.There is one other point I want to make regarding the impact these price increases are having on business. We conducted a survey some months back with Amárach Consulting. We asked companies what the situation was in terms of energy and energy prices. Of the companies which replied, 75% stated Ireland and their business, in particular, were at a competitive disadvantage because of energy costs. Companies are not able to pass on the increase in energy costs. Only 3% of the companies which replied stated they were in a position to pass on the costs; 97% had to absorb all of the increase or part of it. The situation now is that increases in energy costs are coming off the bottom line and impacting on business. A frightening statistic is that almost one quarter of the companies which responded stated that because of energy prices and other price factors they were considering relocating their business out of Ireland.Manufacturing is a sector of the economy which is suffering very badly. It is also the sector which uses the highest amount of energy. We have lost 30,000 jobs in the past three years. We have moved from a position where there were 320,000 people employed in manufacturing industry five years ago to one where there are now 290,000. We are losing at least 500 jobs a month. The energy component of a manufacturing company's cost base is very considerable.IBEC is trying to present the committee with the fact that a very difficult and stark reality is being faced by Irish business. However, in making the presentation we also felt we should try to propose some solutions to the issue of energy prices. There were particular decisions that could have been taken by the regulator that could have greatly reduced the impact of the most recent price increases. There is an ESB revenue stream of €89 million that has been deferred for a number of years. This year the regulator decided to grant that €89 million to it. Of itself that had an impact on the cost base.The Government continues to take a dividend from the ESB. In the past three years it has taken €184 million from it. If that money had been reinvested in the network, it could have reduced the price increases. The regulator could also have offered much greater flexibility in how companies purchase and deal in gas. We have met and discussed the situation with the regulator who says every €20 million is the equivalent of a 1% increase in electricity prices. This year alone the Government took €77 million from the ESB. If this money had not been taken but reinvested in the system, the increase by the Commission for Energy Regulation could have been reduced by almost 4%. That would have almost wiped out the increase for domestic consumers and greatly reduced the increase for the business community.Looking ahead at what needs to be done, there is a new national development programme being prepared. In the existing National Development Plan 2000-2006 the energy sector is almost totally ignored in terms of infrastructure. This is a sector that needs massive investment in infrastructure, yet in the first national development plan it received €140 million while education received €2 billion; health, €2.5 billion; public transport, €2.8 billion; the environment, almost €4 billion; local infrastructure, €4 billion; and national roads, €6 billion. The new plan is now being prepared. We strongly argue that energy infrastructure needs to be supported.There is no policy on energy, although we understand it is in preparation. We are saying to the Government that in developing its policy it needs to look at how we develop the energy market, the role of incumbents, the fuel mix, the potential to support renewable energy, meeting the issue of security of supply and also funding network development. There is also considerable potential in the medium to long term to develop an all-island energy market. We also need to look east-west.We need to ask whether the regulator is applying the right level of increases and whether we need stricter scrutiny of the role of the regulator, given the increases being announced. The business community is dissatisfied at the level of increase being awarded by the regulator. In many cases, the increases are excessive.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Is that on the basis of the Hunt report?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	188	There have been a number of analyses. I will show the committee later a figure which demonstrates that the figure the regulator brings forward for business fails to reflect actual costs. While the regulator bases his prices on the ESB client base, the company admits it does not have heavy industrial users among its customers. I will set out exactly the level businesses have paid for electricity in the past two years.We must be sure organisations such as the ESB and Bord Gáis operate at the highest levels of efficiency. While we hear they are working hard to improve their efficiency levels, they must adopt the practices adopted in the private sector. A question remains as to guaranteed security of supply. We remain in a catch-up phase in the provision of energy infrastructure. While generating plants will open next year at Aughinish in Limerick and Tynagh in Galway, there are no further proposals to open new generating facilities. We require the equivalent of one major new generating plant to open every two years. Given the difficulty of providing new infrastructure, the absence of plans beyond the provision of two plants next year means our prospects beyond that date do not look sound. In the context of security of supply, we argue very strongly on the need to support renewable energy options. We are much more heavily dependent on fossil fuels in Ireland than any other country in Europe. This has left us exposed, especially in the context of the recent coal and gas price increases.Rapid changes in energy prices have had significant negative impacts on business. Industry has responded. The businesses represented here today have done what they can to make energy consumption as efficient as possible through the introduction of many innovative measures. We need a competitive environment which meets the needs of all stakeholders in the energy market, whether providers or users. Ireland has the worst of all worlds in the absence of both security of supply and competitive prices. They are the fundamental challenges we face and the issues the regulator is supposed to address. We have failed on both fronts.I will come back to Deputy Broughan's point about actual energy increases. We have provided the committee with a table which demonstrates the increases sanctioned by the regulator for heavy energy users. The increase for 2004-05 was 12.5%. In 2006 it will be 8%. We have surveyed businesses across a range of sectors to determine the actual increases they face. While the regulator said the average increase this year was 12.5%, the actual increase in mining, for example, was 21%. The increase in the plastics sector was 13%, 20% in the chemical sector and 18% in the building materials sector. From January next the regulator intends to increase prices by 8%, but the businesses represented here today will face increases of between 12% and 19.5% which are a long way from the published tariff figure. These figures represent a significant crisis for Irish-based businesses. Energy prices are impacting on our competitiveness and leading to job losses in the manufacturing sector. The real shame is that decisions taken by the regulator could have avoided some of the increases which have been applied.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Before Mr. Butler introduces the other delegations, I am anxious to hear from Intel, one of the largest consumers of energy in the economy, and some of the other larger consumers. Before I do so, I put it to Mr. Butler that the Sustainable Energy Ireland report suggests 96% of industrial gross value added — €34 billion in 2001 — was produced by enterprises spending less than 4% of direct costs on energy. These account for 61% of energy releases, CO2, and 96% of industrial employment. The report also indicates 211 enterprises, or 4%, have energy costs in excess of 5% of direct costs and that there are ten enterprises with energy bills greater than 20% of direct costs. While this is set out as part of SEI's emissions submission, is Mr. Butler suggesting energy costs have increased significantly since 2001 from a figure of 4% of business costs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The best way to answer is to follow the Chairman's own suggestion by asking Intel to outline how its energy costs have changed over the period. It would be very helpful in clarifying matters.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	191	We will do that. Is Mr. Butler suggesting there should be an outside audit of the efficiency of energy-producing, semi-State bodies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	192	We need to be absolutely certain that any body providing energy is following the practices which apply in a competitive industry.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Is Mr. Butler including private operators with private plants?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Our understanding is that because private plants operate in a different environment, they may not need the same scrutiny. We need to be satisfied that the main energy providers are operating to a high standard.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	195	We should be clear that Mr. Butler is referring to State operators.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	196	That is our primary concern.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Mr. Butler will be aware that the committee is extremely concerned at the lack of an energy policy and the direction we are taking. It is for this reason that meetings have been taking place in the past 12 months, although they have had to be interrupted to deal with other business. Mr. Butler will also be aware that the committee has produced a report on broadband with 12 recommendations which we have recently reviewed with a view to its forthcoming publication. While that is a different element of our work, it will illustrate for Mr. Butler how interested and concerned the committee is in respect of his prediction that the lights might go out if there is a failure to produce sufficient energy and a lack of companies to contribute to production.How have energy costs changed since 2001?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	198	When we benchmarked our power costs five years ago against those in our other manufacturing sites across the world, we were in the lowest or best quartile in terms of the average price for power. Intel Ireland has seen an overall increase in its electrical power costs of approximately 60% since. When we benchmark current costs against those in other manufacturing sites, we are in the highest quartile. While we have been supplied in the period by independent power producers in the marketplace, the spiralling cost of power has meant our energy cost base has begun to reach unacceptable levels. Ireland is being positioned as an unattractive, uncompetitive place to do business, especially when we look at future growth at our site here.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Did Mr. Dunne say 60%?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The increase was 60% over the five year period.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Right across the board.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The increase to which I refer was in electrical power costs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	206	It represents the best rate we could negotiate in the period.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The ESB has not been Intel's provider.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Our power was sourced in the period from independent power producers.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I would like to speak about Ireland as a competitive place in which to do business. Intel Ireland is constantly trying to attract new investment to the Leixlip site. It is obvious that every organisation in the world, including those considering setting up businesses on greenfield sites, is looking at infrastructural costs in the various possible locations. It is obvious that costs have reached unacceptable levels in recent years, as Mr. Dunne said. That Ireland has moved from being one of the lowest cost locations to being one of the highest cost does not help it when it tries to present itself as a competitive place in which to do business. I am aware that Intel's Irish management team is very concerned about this issue.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I would like to ask about Intel Ireland's total costs. Mr. Dunne referred to absolute costs, but I am interested in the total cost changes since 2000. What percentage of Intel Ireland's total costs was then represented by electricity costs? What is the relevant percentage now?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I am not sure of that figure.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I cannot give a certain figure. I imagine that the relevant percentage was in the low single digits five years ago, but has increased to between 5% and 7% now.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I suggest Mr. Bert-Ove Johansson from Boliden Tara Mines should speak about this matter. The key question being considered by the committee is the extent of energy costs, as a proportion of total costs.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	218	That is what we really need to know.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I am interested in knowing whether electricity is being supplied to industry by a private operator or a semi-State body. Is it all governed by the regulator?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	220	We need to be clear on this matter. Companies which use large amounts of energy do not get their electricity from the ESB.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Not any more.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The ESB cannot match the prices of the independent suppliers. The fact that it does not supply such companies is significant because one can be quite sure that the companies have checked out the ESB's rates only to find they can get a slightly better deal by using independent suppliers.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Does Mr. Butler refer to a private company which is supplying power into the national grid?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I presume that the company in question is efficient.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	It does not need an audit which was mentioned.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Is it not possible that one of the private companies in question is what is known to members of this committee as "an incumbent"? Is it not the case that the company which was the incumbent in Northern Ireland is still in a hugely dominant position in that market?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The increase in the cost of power does not just affect one particular sector of the economy. Its impact is felt right across the board. Costs in this country are high. We have high wages, a high cost of living and high standards of living. Ireland is not a low-cost country like Spain or Portugal where levels of income are different. We have to compare like with like.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I must interrupt at this point. We used to be warned about the dangers of a high wage policy. We were told in the 1980s that we were pricing ourselves out of the market and that we could not export because we were uncompetitive. There has been a change in thinking, but I do not know from whence it came. Economists will always advise one to err on the side of conservatism. Whether we like it, we are pricing ourselves out of the market as a consequence of a combination of factors. Nobody wants to address the fact that energy prices and wages are very high. People prefer to think they are much happier because wages are much higher, but nothing could be further from the truth. We lost our markets — manufacturing companies moved to other locations — in the 1980s because Ireland was uncompetitive. There are signs to indicate that companies in the service sector will move elsewhere. If service sector companies move after manufacturing sector firms, it will pose very serious problems. I do not know what the solution is, but we may have some of the answers. We need to examine as a matter of extreme urgency the many reasons a number of jobs have relocated to lower wage economies in recent times. If we do not engage in such an examination, we will have a much more serious problem on our hands in three or four years' time, particularly if interest rates are increased, which is likely to happen. I could not let the Chairman's comments on high costs in this country go unnoticed.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I was just asking for the views of the delegates on the matter.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I am interested in them too.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I understand the Deputy's political perspective on the matter. I have to ask certain questions, as he knows. I invite Mr. Bert-Ove Johansson to address the committee.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I represent Boliden Tara Mines, a mining operation based outside Navan, some 60 km north west of Dublin. The operation which is Europe's largest zinc producer and has been in operation since 1976 produces concentrates, rather than the actual metal zinc. It is one of the largest such operations in the entire world. It has been calculated that the mine's lifespan will continue until 2014 when the operation will have to come to an end. Additional moneys will be invested in exploration until then in the hope of finding new mineralisation which can be turned to ore.The company has had to deal with substantial cost increases, for example, in respect of electricity. In 2001 electricity costs accounted for approximately 9% of the company's operating costs. The relevant percentage is approximately 13% at present and will increase to approximately 15% next year. The increases in the cost of electricity in the past two years have meant that the Tara Mines operation has had to meet additional costs of approximately €4.3 million. In other words, prices have increased by €4.3 million in two years. Boliden Tara Mines is not an operation that will move abroad because the natural resource on which its business is based is found in the Irish ground. However, it needs to find ways of cutting other costs in order that it can meet its increased energy costs. The company could recoup the additional €4.3 million it has had to spend in the past two years by cutting 100 jobs. It will not take such a course of action today, but it has to look forward. If it is unable to meet the cost increases, it cannot consider transferring them to its customers. Its products are priced on the international market.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The company's energy costs have increased from 9% of its total costs in 2001 to 13% this year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Yes. Energy costs will account for 15% of the company's total costs next year. When I spoke about 2014, it was based on the previous years' calculations, the cost figures and the ore research. If the increases I have mentioned continue, the company will be unable to cope. The portion of the mineral resource in the form of ore that is mined will be much less. If we assume that we are unable to add more resources, the closure of the operation will happen two or three years earlier if the cost increases continue. The company employs 670 people in the Navan area where it is the biggest private company. It has retained a steady number of employees since 1976. It is a very steady operation.I would like to make just one more point. Ireland is the world's fifth biggest producer of zinc. The geology of Ireland is extremely suitable for mining for zinc and lead. What is most interesting is that we can talk about an ongoing operation. One of the things which will hit hard in the long term is that the money being spent by companies on exploring for more mineral resources will probably be spent in other areas. That is unfortunate because many parts of Ireland are highly suitable for mining projects of the same size as Lisheen, although perhaps it would be a dream to find somewhere like the current Tara Mines site. Nobody will expect cost increases of the kind I have mentioned. Given that Boliden Tara Mines uses approximately 170 million kw hours of energy, one can imagine the ultimate cost of even a small increase in electricity prices.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I would like to ask a number of questions. Perhaps I will ask them at the end of this meeting, after I have been to the Chamber for the Order of Business.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Deputy should ask his questions now.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I congratulate the members of the delegation for the manner in which they have made their case. A number of serious issues arise from what we have heard. I do not know whether it is necessary for members of the committee to ask questions at this stage, given that we have been asked whether we can bring influence to bear on the powers that be to address these issues.The first matter that arises is the efficacy, or lack of it, of the regulator. I have said on many occasions that there are more regulators in this country than there were in the aftermath of the American Civil War. I think they were called reconstructionists at the time. I agree with those who have queried the efficacy of the regulator — there is no contest in that regard.In regard to wind energy, some time ago the regulator suggested no further funding should be provided because of the danger to security of supply. There are other ways of dealing with the issue of security of supply and we all know what they are, for example, the provision of an interconnector needs to be thought about as a matter of extreme urgency. The delegation presents to the joint committee the fact that heavy industry draws heavily on energy and the major consequences in the event of a failure in supply. That is the first issue. Rather than ask the delegation what it thinks we should do, we have to ask ourselves what we need to do about this. All parties are developing an energy policy as a consequence of rising international fuel prices. I do not accept the notion that we should automatically keep pace with international fuel prices because we have several disadvantages. If we have an opportunity to compete with lower fuel prices, we should not automatically jump ahead with price increases as that would have a double negative effect.I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions in recent years on the failure to compete with others offering services at a lower rate. What is most shocking is the energy chart which shows the cost of electricity, in respect of which Ireland is top of the list in the European Union. What we need to look at — the delegation may be able to help us — are the input costs that have caused us to have the highest costs. Is it lack of competition, a failure to incorporate the use of alternative fuels, a failure to have more people in the workplace, the cost of the infrastructure's network, the cost of gaining access to the grid or the level of bureaucracy? In his report Mr. Paul Hunt refers to the inflated valuation of the infrastructure, resulting in higher input costs for those who wish to access the grid. We have a serious problem. This is appalling. We are not even in the middle of the group; we have the highest costs.Today I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister asking him to identify the causes for the lack of competition and the consequent relocation of industry. The whole concept of a regulator needs to be looked at again as it does not appear to be working, not only in the energy sector but in several others also. The regulator only appears to be a go-between in looking over the shoulder of the Government at the populace who are the beneficiaries or the victims of its decisions.What is shocking is that because of an inability to compete 30,000 jobs have been relocated to economies which have lower wage costs and lower energy prices. We only have to look at the chart for confirmation of this. Economists told us in the 1980s that we were living beyond our means and had become accustomed to high wages. This was fine for a short time, but eventually it caught up with us and we priced ourselves out of the business. It took us a long time to change our tune. It took ten difficult years to return to a competitive position. Ten years ago Ireland was very competitive, but suddenly we have slipped. The delegation has asked us a number of questions which we have to address as a matter of urgency.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Did the Deputy ask any question in his deliberations?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I did. I was worried the Chairman would not ask me any question. I had to interrupt, despite the fact that I had intimated at an early stage that I wished to deal with other issues.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I did not wish to interrupt the Deputy's flow.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I agree with much of what Deputy Durkan said. I wish to ask approximately six brief questions which Mr. Butler or some of his colleagues might answer. Are there not many companies which are members of IBEC which are in the energy or construction business which relentlessly pass on additional energy costs to business and household consumers? Is that not part of the problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	244	If the Deputy is asking if all of the energy providers are members of IBEC, the answer is yes.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Is that not an issue for the delegation to address internally because there are parts of the economy where costs are passed on relentlessly to small business and households. I do not see what the delegation is doing to tackle this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The energy survey showed that only 3% of companies were in a position to pass on costs.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Some 250,000 of the workforce at least as well as many ancillary workers work in construction and there is a relentless passing on of costs. Is that not a fact?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The other statistic of which we must be conscious is that 30,000 jobs have been lost in the companies which have closed down. The cost base was a factor.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Yes, but part of the problem, as the economist Jim O'Leary said recently, is the dominance of construction in all its forms, including land speculation, that it is skewing the economy. We are ending up with a high cost economy which is largely driven by the construction industry. This puts us in difficulty with valuable companies such as the two which have testified before us, which we treasure and do not want to lose because of their massive workforces. There are fundamental issues to be addressed by IBEC.In regard to Mr. Butler's presentation, it is an indictment of the Government which has been in office for the past nine years — bitter years from an Opposition spokesperson's point of view——
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I hope Mr. Butler does not agree.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	251	——that we have no energy policy. There was something in place in the mid-1990s. Year after year the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, talks about having such a policy. Unfortunately, we are heading around the last bend towards the general election. It is a shocking indictment that one can come before this committee and say there is no energy policy.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Perhaps Mr. Butler can take the two questions together.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Does the Deputy have other questions?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Mr. Butler has not adequately addressed the point my colleague and I put to him about the Hunt report. From what he or one of his colleagues sent us, there appears to be an element of gold plating of infrastructure, especially with Bord Gáis but also with the ESB. We have made some demands of the ESB about making the network accessible to renewables and so forth. Even allowing for this — it seems to be what Mr. Hunt was saying — there is an element of gold plating, for which the Intels, Tara Mines and little companies are paying. The regulator has failed in his central duty as we told him when he came before the joint committee a few months ago.My fourth point concerns the incumbent in the Republic whose representatives we will meet shortly, including the chief executive and members of senior management. It will state that in the all-island market it will be down to 45%. We read in the newspapers this morning that it is a successful international company and that it is looking for opportunities abroad. It is a high value company. Efficiencies were mentioned. What should the ESB do? We have heard that there are elements of its marginal costs which need to be addressed, but which are not being addressed. That might present a problem.We are more interested in green issues, although we are not all members of the Green Party. We have been converted by Deputy Eamon Ryan and his party. We all come from a rural background. It is a tribute to the Green Party and all the groups that we feel more in touch with green issues today. We have all signed the pledge by Friends of the Earth on climate change. One of the negatives of the renewable route is that there are additional costs. We must have proper pricing support mechanisms for renewables. How does that tie in with the general point made today? Is the delegation prepared to work with this? Security of supply was mentioned. In the discussion we had this morning with the distinguished academic from UCC it was suggested this country was set to become a huge exporter of energy supplies. We are lucky in that we have everything, including wave and wind power and biofuels. We have a tremendous future.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Mr. Butler can share the questions, if he so wishes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I will answer the questions as best I can. There is a significant role for renewable energy. In the next few weeks IBEC will bring out a major policy statement on the importance of renewable energy and what should be done. We are prepared to work to ensure we meet the target set out by the Government, namely, to move towards a figure of 13% in the next few years.As regards the ESB, its cost base and efficiencies, that is the point we made. From our perspective, because the ESB has such a significant role to play, it is vital that the users of energy are satisfied that it is operating to the highest level of efficiency. We have made it clear in our discussions with it that we want it to operate with the same competitive practices which would be applied by a private sector company. That is what IBEC and the people sitting around the table today who are paying these costs are looking for.The Hunt report is a detailed one which suggests there are issues in terms of how infrastructure is being valued and how it is working through the system. Ultimately, IBEC cannot change this. That position was put to the regulator but, as I understand it, the regulator did not accept the findings of the Hunt report. Who determines energy prices? It is not the ESB, IBEC or this committee, but the regulator. We understand the regulator did not accept the position put forward in the Hunt report.Energy policy has been the Cinderella of industrial policy for the past 20 or 30 years, not the past nine. There is a national development plan.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	258	IBEC went into social partnership talks year after year. Did it ever state to the Government that it wanted an energy policy the following year or under the plan?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Our understanding is that as a result of our lobbying and other efforts by this committee, we will have an energy policy in the next few months. We want it, have fought for it and will have it. However, it is decades too late.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	272	With the committee's indulgence, I would like Mr. Dick Budden from Wellman to give us a short insight. We have been talking a lot today about the electricity sector. However, it is not just about electricity. We are talking about the energy sector which also includes gas.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	273	We will allow Mr. Budden to speak. Deputy Eamon Ryan can then ask his questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the Oireachtas committee about the issues affecting my company. Wellman has been operating in County Cavan for more than 30 years. It is a manufacturing business with a turnover of just over €100 million. We employ more than 300 people. In addition to the operations in Ireland, we also have small subsidiaries in France and the Netherlands. We consume more than 42 million kilowatt hours of electricity in Ireland annually, which puts us in the top 35 users. In addition, we use approximately 52 million kilowatt hours of gas, which puts us in the top 30 gas users. Gas is more important to us than electricity. Taken together, on aggregate, we are one of the top 25 consumers.The current round of energy price increases threatens the viability of our company. The committee has already spoken about the loss of manufacturing jobs. Energy represents the third largest cost at our Irish plant after raw materials and the cost of employing people. Our energy bill this year will amount to more than €4 million. Our business is low margin. We are operating in tough trading conditions and have strong competition from the Asians and European producers in the accession states of the European Union. Our energy bill this year will be approximately twice our profits after tax. Between 2000 and 2004 the cost of energy increased by approximately 4%, 5% or 6% a year. This year it has increased by more than 20%. Next year we forecast it will rise by a further €1 million a quarter. By next year our energy bill will have risen cumulatively by more than 80% since 2000. These increases in energy costs have significantly eroded our profitability.We can contrast our experience in Ireland with that of our subsidiaries in the Netherlands and France, which are smaller. Depending on whether one compares electricity or gas, our Irish plant consumes between six and 15 times the amount of energy they use. We have been able to take advantage of the opportunities deregulation has brought there by playing one user off against another and achieving multi-year contracts in both cases. As regards electricity, our costs on the Continent next year will be approximately 10% above the costs in 2000. By contrast, in Ireland costs will be more than 55% higher than in 2000 and 25% higher than at those smaller operations on the Continent. Similarly, we have been able to negotiate multi-year contracts for gas on the Continent. The cost of gas has risen faster than the cost of electricity. The cost of gas in the continental operations next year will be twice what it was in 2000. However, if one takes a one year contract from today for the price of gas in Ireland, it will be three times what it was in 2000. The price of gas next year for us in Ireland will be 30% higher than for our tiny French subsidiary and more than 40% higher than for our Dutch subsidiary.The committee has heard what IBEC proposes in the case of electricity. However, of greater concern to my company is the fact that trading conditions in the market for gas need to be liberalised. In the absence of multiple supply options, greater emphasis must be placed on strengthening users' flexibility and bargaining power. In setting up tariff controls to govern how Bord Gáis may sell, the regulator has removed the flexibility we previously enjoyed. We are a significant gas consumer in our own right. As electricity is largely generated from gas, it is the principal cost of the electricity we buy. If we were able to combine our requirements for gas, we would be higher up the purchasing scale and would be able to strike a much keener deal with Bord Gáis or any other provider.We have no wish to become a trader in gas, but we seek the freedom to access the benefits offered by the wholesale market — through our supplier — either Bord Gáis or another company of our choice. Bord Gáis would purchase gas on our instruction and refloat if we choose, either using that gas for our own consumption or having others convert it to electricity on our behalf. Having access to the wholesale market in this way, we would be able to focus our negotiations with electricity suppliers on the costs and price of conversion, introducing a significant quantum of freedom compared with the present restrictive tariff arrangements. To achieve this, the regulator would need to remove restrictions in the regulated tariff formula, RTF, that deny us the freedom to purchase gas, monthly or daily, or refloat it and that tie us to three-month contracts. This restriction above all constrains our ability to obtain real value from the international market. If long-standing and substantial users such as us are not to be disadvantaged, perhaps fatally, the regulator should focus on reforming and liberalising demand side structures to give large customers greater clout.Without wishing to appear flippant, but to introduce a slightly lighter note, may I draw the attention of the committee to an advertisement from a large energy producer which is currently appearing in some of the trade magazines and which illustrates a tiny boy swamped by the clothes in which he is dressed and wearing huge boots that would fit even me. The headline reads "How big do you have to be before energy suppliers start taking you seriously?" This absolutely hits the point.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I apologise that I had to leave for part of the presentation; I was obliged to be in the Dáil for Question Time. The witnesses will be glad to hear that I got to ask a good question in support of Irish businesses in Europe.I take Deputy Broughan's point that we will have to work together towards a new energy future in this country and a co-operative partnership will be required. I look forward to working with IBEC and other parties on that basis. In terms of energy, the future will be radically different from what happened in our lifetimes. It behoves all of us to address the challenges we face.I will address my remarks to IBEC rather than the individual companies because it is more difficult, when dealing with such companies, to look at particular circumstances. My questions on general policy agreements are directed to Mr. Butler and possibly Mr. Donal Buckley.Would IBEC agree that the first important principle in looking at energy policy is that we should take a long-term view, particularly as current investment, whether in a grid, pipeline or plant, will have implications in 20, 30 or even 40 years' time? I also contend that we must take cognisance of long-term trends in terms of the supply of energy and begin to act in respect of these. The committee has agreed, on a policy basis, to consider the position in 2050 and work back from there as to the likely future scenarios. It is difficult to look so far forward but it is important to do so in terms of energy policy.I would be interested to hear the views of IBEC on two issues that, in my opinion, dominate the future of energy policy. The first of these is the inevitable peak in global oil production and, almost certainly by 2050, a correspondent peak in gas production. The heads of Chevron, Exxon and a number of other companies have indicated that once the peak occurs — I believe it is years rather than decades away — we are looking at an inevitable annual reduction of anything between 2%, 4% or 5% in availability of oil and a corresponding dramatic change in future costs of energy. Do the representatives from IBEC agree that has been of significant consequence and that we need to begin taking action now rather than waiting until it occurs?In regard to climate change, the Government has signed a commitment to reduce emissions by anything from between 15% to 30% from 1990 levels by 2020. Countries, such as France, England, Germany and Holland have all agreed to a reduction of between 60% to 80% by 2050. Given that our emissions will, by 2012, be something of the order of 30% above 1990 levels, we will be obliged to reduce them by 40% to 50% in the eight years to 2020. Do our guests accept that this is the scenario with which we are faced in terms of long-term energy policy and that it will have dramatic implications for everything we do on a policy, if not on an individual company, basis? Does IBEC accept that these two crucial scenarios will dominate not just energy policy but also economic policy in the medium to long term? Perhaps we can flesh out the detail of this question later.The perception is that IBEC's policy has been set by a small number of very large companies. I raise the issue of Cement Roadstone Holdings in this regard, although it might be slightly glib to do so. If, for example, we consider the issue of carbon tax, which might have affected companies such as CRH, the perception is that IBEC's involvement was to effectively move us away from the use of such a tax. The information supplied earlier by Sustainable Energy Ireland provides a remarkable picture of where the genuine interests of Irish businesses lie. SEI indicated that 95% of companies spend less than 5% — a remarkably small amount — of their cost-ratio on energy. Sustainable Energy Ireland stated that ten companies — individual company details are confidential — account for 20% of national emissions. Are we not concentrating too much on smaller companies and failing to recognise the reality for the vast majority of companies or the significant potential that exists in terms of developing new businesses, particularly in the area of renewables?Mr. Buckley mentioned that the tax take from the ESB accounts for approximately 4% of the price increase, which brings us above the European average. In a presentation made to the committee in the summer — at a meeting at which Mr. Buckley was present — it was stated that excess emissions from the electricity generating sector are 2.5 million tonnes above that sector's quota allocation under the European trading scheme. In that context and in light of the current market rate for carbon of approximately €25 per tonne, this represents an annual cost of €60 million in respect of electricity generation. Some months ago, that figure was €70 million. Mr. Buckley may correct me if I am wrong but the level of our emission of excess carbon is currently 2.5 million tonnes per year. At a cost of €25 per tonne on the European trading market, that is equal to a national bill of approximately €70 million. However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ignores that reality and only counts what he must pay. This additional cost has the potential of a 4% price hike on our electricity bills because we must buy it under the European trading system. Does it not make more sense, as Professor John Fitzgerald suggested, that we should try to reduce our carbon emissions through measures such as a carbon tax, rather than send the money out of the country through the emissions trading system?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	We will take the answers to those questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I am in complete agreement with Deputy Eamon Ryan in respect of the long-term view. The decisions we take now have implications for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ahead and that is our perspective. There are different views as to when supply problems will arise in the case of oil and gas. Our presentation pointed out that currently we are too heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The problem is staring us in the face because we have the highest dependency on fossil fuels of practically any modern economy. We strongly support the development of renewable energy.Climate change is another issue. We have set ourselves a challenging target and are moving in the right direction. What is important is how Ireland approaches the issue of climate change. We should not approach it in a manner that puts us at a significant competitive disadvantage to other economies and how they deal with it. Large parts of the developed world have not signed up to the Kyoto Protocol. Europe has taken the lead on this issue but the jury is still out in terms of whether the approach taken by Europe is appropriate in terms of the European policy on the Lisbon strategy. Mr. Donal Buckley may wish to comment on that point.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The jury is far from out in terms of the science of climate change. Mr. Butler said we have set ourselves a challenging target. Is IBEC, therefore, at one with the Government — in terms of the position at European Heads of Government level — that a 15% to 30% reduction by 2020 from 1990 levels is the target?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Our current target covers the years up to 2012.

Is it not the level to which IBEC would also adhere?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It is clear that significant reductions, in the order of those mentioned by Deputy Eamon Ryan, are under discussion. As the science improves, we will know the exact level we need. If we take the Deputy's comment that we are going to run out of fossil fuels, the point is made that we need a significant culture change away from fossil fuels towards renewable sources.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Unfortunately, climate change will not be solved by us running out of fossil fuels. We have plenty of coal and gas left to actually tilt the planet's climate system into runaway change. While the two issues are connected, one is not a solution to the other.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I never said they were a solution but they are connected. We require a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The Kyoto Agreement decided levels up to 2012 and the Montreal agreement will decide what we do in the following phase. IBEC is fully aware that we need a significant reduction. I am not sure what will be the exact level.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	297	In terms of energy policy, will IBEC, like the committee, consider the issue on a 2050 basis?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Absolutely.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	299	On emissions, does the €70 million cost per annum resulting from excess electricity carbon emissions equal a 4% increase in cost?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I apologise, I do not understand the question.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Under the European emissions trading system, we have allocated to the electricity generation sector the ability to emit 14 million tonnes of carbon. The sector currently emits 16.5 million tonnes of carbon. We must, therefore, buy 2.5 million tonnes on the European market at whatever the cost, be it €20 to €30 per tonne. A few months ago, the price of carbon was €30 and we calculated that 2.5 million tonnes meant a total bill of between €50 and €70 million. That is a similar cost to the dividend, to which Mr. Butler referred, that is paid by the ESB to the Government each year. Would it not make more sense to reduce our electricity costs in the long term by reducing carbon through measures such as introducing a carbon tax? We would keep that revenue in the country and it could be placed in a fund to assist businesses to reduce energy use.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The options are not just to buy. Fuel switching and abatement are other options. It is not essential that we buy. That is the issue with trading. People buy if they wish to buy but they can also fuel switch or use the option of abatement. Emissions trading is not just about purchasing.

If my questions have been answered, our guests should refer me to what was said earlier. I was interested in and shocked by what Mr. Budden had to say. If his experience of where we are going in terms of energy price increases is typical, we must be alarmed. One of the slides shows that the sharp rise in prices coincided with the introduction of the regulator. What is the IBEC attitude towards the regulator and regulation in general? What, in simple terms, is IBEC's attitude to the Corrib gas field? Where are we heading in this regard and has IBEC a view on the big picture?Another slide shows a question mark about the medium-term long-term liberalisation model. This infers that IBEC may feel the liberalisation model has not been successful for Ireland. With regard to the future of the ESB in particular, does IBEC have an opinion on ESB dominance and how it might be structured in the future in terms of liberalisation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	What IBEC wants from any regulator is a system that is fair to both sides. The role of the regulator is to guarantee security of supply and to have competitive prices. At present, however, we have neither. On the Corrib gas field, we have just had a detailed discussion on our propensity to import fossil fuels from abroad. The Corrib gas field could meet 70% of our gas requirements for the next 16 years, which, I think, answers IBEC's view on it.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Will Mr. Butler outline that view? Is IBEC keen to see the Corrib gas field developed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Absolutely. From a business perspective, it is critical.On the liberalisation model, it is not a question of whether the ESB is the right organisation. Liberalisation is supposed to operate in a way that brings competitors into the marketplace and brings prices down. There has been some success in some of the liberalisation and deregulation processes. I refer, for example, to what happened in respect of airlines and telecommunications. Prices have come down, there are competitors in the marketplace and consumers benefit. In terms of the energy market, the liberalisation model has not yielded the same results. We have some of the highest prices in Europe and we have only a small number of people participating in the market. The question we must ask, therefore, is whether there is a particular reason the liberalisation market has not worked as well in the energy area as it has in other areas. We suggest that the scale of the market in Ireland is incredibly small, while there are significant establishment costs in terms of energy and the development of infrastructure. We mentioned earlier that we have had 20 or 30 years of under-investment in infrastructure, which meant it had to be developed when the liberalisation model was introduced. This led to the double whammy that has contributed to the lack of success of the liberalisation process in the energy market.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I would like to have heard the IBEC presentation but I was detained in the Seanad. I am from County Limerick and am well aware of the concerns of a significant consumer of electricity and gas in the county with regard to increases in costs. We should not underestimate the implications for industry of continued increases. While we may be buoyed up by the Celtic tiger and high employment rates, heavy users in industry have issues with increased costs. I listened with interest to Mr. Budden. We have had the regulator before the committee from time to time and I have often clashed with him. Is he debarring large potential energy users from squaring up and making good deals for themselves by allowing suppliers to hide behind the regulator? Perhaps he is saying to Bord Gáis and others that they must abide by the rules and regulations as laid down. Would it be less damaging for large users if the regulator did not exist?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Rather than have IBEC answer, it might be better to have one of the company representatives respond.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	From my company's perspective, the energy regulator's focus has principally been on supply and methods to increase the number of providers. The means of achieving this end have focused, to too large an extent, on structuring pricing and tariffs to encourage new providers to enter the market. We contend that the regulator must also focus ways to empower us as a significant consumer to increase the flexibility with which we can negotiate for our own advantage on our own behalf and not merely on ways to incentivise suppliers.

Is this also on the industrial user's bill?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Yes.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Responding to my question as to whether it is anti-competitive to include the public service obligation in such bills, the regulator admitted that it was. I requested that he do something about it. Even the domestic consumer has complained in recent times about the increases in charges. Industry has more serious problems.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Is it true that there is a public service obligation charge even if one's supplier is a body other than the ESB?

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Would it be possible to provide the committee with a five-year analysis of energy charges from Mr. Budden's company, Tara Mines and Intel and a comparison with international locations? We would have to compare like with like by using examples from Europe or, if necessary, the USA. As the structure may be different in the USA, we would have to be careful. I would like to see how gas and other energy costs have increased in the five-year period by comparison with sister or parent companies in other states.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	We could all give its name.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I thank Mr. Butler for his presentation, which the committee found extremely helpful. In our broadband report, we recommended a partnership focus from telecommunications companies, box makers, software vendors and Internet service providers to agree a strategy. Intel attended the committees meetings on that matter. Is a similar approach necessary in the context of energy? Should all stakeholders be consulted on and buy into a policy? While there will be short-term gains for some, short-term pain for others, as well as long-term gains and problems, I am advised that Denmark has a policy which remains in place regardless of who is in Government. The policy is unchanged as it has been set in stone with all the stakeholders and users involved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	IBEC has a central policy committee which brings together energy providers, high and low energy consumers, the renewables sector and climate change groups. A policy is something we would like to explore, given how well the partnership approach has served Ireland.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	320	IBEC has not been involved to date. Mr. Butler said that there was no energy policy. I took this to infer that IBEC had not been consulted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	We are feeding into the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on what should be included in the energy policy.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	323	No, we have consistently communicated with the Department.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	What I suggest is that all stakeholders rather than IBEC alone should be involved in the development of an energy policy for Ireland which would survive beyond the term of office of any Government. It is a similar suggestion to the 2050 policy proposed by my Green Party colleague.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	325	What the Chairman says is true and it relates to our earlier discussion of a partnership approach to long-term energy policy. Consideration of energy relates usually to periods which are longer than short-term electoral timeframes and it tends to go beyond commercial interests. Most of us are caught up in short-term thinking in our day-to-day involvement in companies or politics. However, long-term energy policy requires us to agree collectively and nationally. The best examples from Denmark and Austria have demonstrated that collective, long-term approaches work. I acknowledge the Chairman's suggestion and recommend that the committee should follow the report from its consultants by determining how we can contribute, perhaps through a sub-committee, to a partnership process. It is the right approach to adopt. Perhaps we could talk to IBEC on that basis later.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Yes. While the committee does not form policy, it adds value to the process by inviting groups to attend and by furnishing reports to the Oireachtas and policy makers in Departments. We expect the work we carry out as committee members and parliamentarians to be taken on board, particularly in light of the number of presentations we receive from expert groups and consumers of the products we consider.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I am from Sweden, which belongs to an open electricity market including Denmark and other northern countries. We pay one third of the price per kilowatt hour. The most fascinating thing is that Boliden, which owns many significant operations in Scandinavian countries, struck a deal up to 2015 for electrical supplies at a controlled price level.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I understand that fully. It is also the case that 55% of Swedish electricity is generated by nuclear power.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	330	We will not discuss that matter today. I thank Mr. Butler and the other delegates for attending. As I said, we found the presentation extremely helpful and informative. If our consultant wishes to engage with witnesses again, we would be grateful for any additional information provided. If there is information which has not been provided today or questions which it is felt have not been replied to sufficiently expansively, witnesses should feel free to make further submissions to the committee's clerk or consultant.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I welcome Mr. Padraig McManus, who is the chief executive of the ESB. He is accompanied by Mr. Aidan O'Regan, the ESB's head of regulatory affairs, Mr. John Shine, the executive director of its networks division, Mr. Pat O'Doherty, the executive director of its power generation division, and Mr. Bernard Byrne, its group finance director.Before I ask Mr. McManus to begin, I advise everyone that the joint committee will hear a short presentation of approximately ten minutes which will be followed by a question and answer session. As the members have had an opportunity to read the ESB presentation, I ask Mr. McManus to summarise it. I draw attention to the fact that while members of the committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the committee. The committee cannot guarantee any level of privilege to witnesses appearing before it. Furthermore, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I draw Mr. McManus's attention to the IBEC delegation's comments about the ESB. I am not sure whether someone was listening to the IBEC presentation on behalf of the ESB. Mr. McManus can respond to those comments if he wishes.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	332	My colleagues and I are pleased to attend this meeting. We hope to give the joint committee an overview of the developments that have taken place since we last addressed it. We will be more than happy to answer the committee's questions on various aspects of the ESB's business.I do not intend to go through our presentation in detail, as the committee has already been furnished with a copy of it. I will, however, highlight some of its key points. I propose to highlight the trends that have emerged in the European electricity generation sector since representatives of the ESB last came before the joint committee. I refer, for example, to the full opening of the Irish electricity market and the progress that has been made in respect of the creation of an all-Ireland electricity market. The ESB has been very supportive of such projects. I would also like to discuss the ESB's international investments in recent years, as well as the capital investments it is continuing to make in Ireland. I will mention electricity prices and the issues that will be faced by the ESB in the years to come. I hope I will cover most of the issues of interest to the joint committee.The ESB used to be responsible for the security of energy supply but that responsibility has been passed to the electricity regulator. The market liberalisation that took place in 2001 was followed by considerable volatility in the fuel markets. I refer in particular to the oil and gas markets and, to a certain degree, to the coal market. Environmental issues have appeared on the agenda in recent times. Electricity companies throughout Europe have been getting bigger, sometimes with the support of Governments. The latter have invested capital resources and restricted fuel supplies and carbon dioxide credits to give companies more power. While the deregulation of the industry in the UK initially led to companies breaking up, such companies have been getting bigger in recent times.I would like to speak about full market opening. The process of ensuring that all electricity customers are free to choose their suppliers has been completed two years ahead of 2007, which was the date set by the EU for the completion of the process by companies in all member states. I am happy to say that the complex information technology programme which was needed as part of that process was delivered on time and within the budget. Not only has the ESB helped to open the market, it has also facilitated competition by reducing its market share and creating space in which its competitors can operate. It has offered bulk power as discount to allow new players to come into the market. It has also offered and given ESB contracts to independent generators and wind generators. The main players in the marketplace — Viridian, Bord Gáis and Airtricity — have developed significantly. Aughinish and Tynagh will enter the market next year.The ESB has been a great supporter of the development of an all-island market because it favours the creation of bigger marketplaces in which it can operate. There has been considerable support from the regulators in Northern Ireland and in the Republic in that regard. The civil services on both sides of the Border are totally committed to having the all-island market in place by 2007. When it is in place, the ESB's market share will be reduced to between 40% and 45%. During the seven-year period between 2000 and 2007, 2000 MW of new plant — 70% of which will be owned by independent producers — will have been installed. The ESB has stated on many occasions that it intends to continue to develop its own generation and business. Plans are at an advanced stage to repower the Aghada station in Cork with a combined cycle gas turbine.On the issue of investments, we have always taken the position that we have to lose market share in Ireland and we are looking at making investments overseas. I have here a photograph of the Amorebieta 800 MW plant in northern Spain which we commissioned recently. We also commissioned the 400 MW combined cycle plant at Coolkeeragh. We are not fully happy with the way the regulatory systems have developed in Northern Ireland. It is not yet a fully open market and, from a regulatory perspective, it is far less transparent than the market in the Republic. That is a matter we are pursuing there. In regard to the Amorebieta project, the strength of the project we developed has been proved by the fact that Osaka Gas, one of the biggest Japanese gas companies, has taken a 50% stake in it. We would like to see similar projects being developed on the overseas market.I return to what is a significant issue, namely, the acceleration of the development of the network in Ireland. The only way the ESB could have retained prices at 1990s levels would have been by not investing. The level of investment made since 2001 in producing a network on which the Irish economy can rely is significant and we will continue to do that. We have spent approximately €3 billion in redeveloping and extending the ESB network. Since the 1980s, that included a doubling of demand for electricity and 370,000 new customers being connected in the past five years. I will not go into the detail but I will give the joint committee a summary of the highlights, which include: some 65,000 km of MV network renewal; 370,000 new connections; 250 km of new transmission circuits; 62 new transmission stations; more than 60 sub-stations refurbished — members can see, on the map provided, how these are spread across the country; and a total capital spend of €3 billion. We intend to continue to complete that programme but it cannot be completed in five years. The next five years will see continuing investment to ensure that Ireland has a network capable of sustaining its economy.In regard to generation, it has always been our intention to modernise and develop the portfolio and to implement best practice. Since we last came before the joint committee, the two new power stations have been commissioned in the midlands at a cost of €460 million. We have also concluded best practice agreements in some of our stations and are committed to doing that in all our stations. We have committed a €360 million investment to the Moneypoint coal-burning plant in County Clare to meet all our regulatory requirements and allow the plant to continue to operate. We intend to rebuild the Aghada power station.On the issue of renewables, by the end of the year the ESB will have 77 MW of wind in operation. Our intention has always been to have approximately 25% of the share of the renewable markets. Current indications are that there will be more than 1,000 MW of wind generation in Ireland by 2010. Some 300 MW have been connected already. Another 600 MW have accepted offers to connect to the system and another 380 MW are being offered to connect. This will allow us reach the national target of over 13% by 2010.I wish now to refer to the price of electricity because that issue has been foremost in the minds of many people. From 2001 to 2006, including the increase due on 1 January 2006, the price of electricity will have increased by approximately 40%. Generation and fuel accounts for 34% of that increase, 4% relates to the redevelopment of the networks and 2% relates to public service obligations. The latter mainly involves support for the peat and wind industries. That is a view of from where the price increases come.Since July 2004, there has been a dramatic increase in the price of the gas we are obliged to buy on the international market. The same applies in respect of oil. This is oil that is priced in dollars per tonne. The oil we buy is low sulphur oil, the source of which is Platt. The price of heavy fuel oil has increased dramatically. With over 80% of Ireland's fuel for generation imported, one can see its impact. If one was to compare Ireland with other European countries, as many have done, one could see from the graph provided that 90% of generation in France comes from hydro and nuclear power. Therefore, 90% of the generation in France is totally independent of any increases in the cost of oil or gas. Scandinavia, where there is a huge amount of hydro power and a considerable amount of nuclear power and renewables, is almost independent of the price of oil and gas. In Spain and Portugal, a considerable amount of energy is generated through nuclear power, hydro power and coal.Coal has increased in price but not to same extent as oil and gas. Germany still has a considerable amount of energy generated by nuclear power and coal. The UK is interesting. I will show another slide just to make the point more clearly. The UK has not developed nuclear power in recent times but it has a considerable amount of coal and gas. Ireland's amounts of hydro power and renewables, at 5%, are quite small when compared to an average of 13% across Europe. The coal, oil and gas, on which Ireland is dependent, are all imported. The baseload price in the UK, compared with France or Germany, has increased by approximately 100% since the beginning of 2005. In terms of the end-user price, British Gas, the largest electricity supplier in the UK, has increased its electricity prices by more than 30% in 18 months. The impact of that increase is that Britain is now looking again at developing the nuclear industry. America is already preparing its strategy document for the future and is committed to developing its electricity on the basis of coal and nuclear. Nuclear power is not something in which we are involved or to which we are committed or have plans to develop. However, one can see the impact it makes. I refer, in particular, to France, where 90% of generation costs are totally independent of what is happening in the oil and gas markets.Perhaps I can make one other point on the issue of ESB's costs. In the recent determination for the next five years in respect of the ESB, the regulator reduced the company's overall revenues by €1.4 billion. The ESB must achieve cost savings in that regard and still provide the infrastructure programme going forward. We have massive infrastructure needs and we intend to deliver on those and retain the organisation's capability to do so. Funding ability is critical for the ESB. We must retain the financial strength of the ESB. We need to reduce costs. That the regulator is taking €1.4 billion off the ESB's revenues over the next five years is a serious development. It is important for Ireland to reach an acceptable market share for the ESB. In other words, it must match the security supply situation with market liberalisation. There is a requirement for international growth to maintain the scale of the company and the business skills we possess.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Mr. McManus referred to costs. Are the ESB's generation costs different from those of private generators? Are they the same or different from those of another company with which it is involved in Ringsend?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The costs are comparable for all players in the Irish market. There is no difference. We must remember that fuel accounts for 50% of the cost of generation. Everyone must buy fuel and import it on the open market.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Why did the regulator mention a figure of €1.4 billion?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The majority of that cost comes from the network's business. The five year regulation he produced for networks showed considerable cuts. Given the high level of money the ESB has invested, namely, €3 billion, in the past five years — it will invest a further €4 billion in the next number of years — it has only impacted about 4% on the price of electricity. The charges for networks have reduced considerably during that period. Much of the costs that have been removed from the ESB in the recent determination by the regulator come from the networks and supply businesses. As regards generation, the regulator has only looked at the next two years because there is the expectation that by 2007 the all-island market will be in place.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Is there room for further cost reductions in the generation side of the business?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	338	There is always room for improvement in terms of costs. However, there is no gap between the cost base of the ESB and other players operating in the Irish market.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	339	What are the costs of the ESB's traditional generating plants compared to that which operates as a joint venture? Is it correct that there are significant differences in the cost of operating those plants?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	340	There is a mix. If one looks at the cost base in terms of staffing in the plant we operate as a joint venture, in the plant we operate in the UK, where we have a 50% ownership, or in the plants in Derry or Spain, the staff numbers compare to those in our combined cycle plant at Poolbeg. As regards the new peat stations, the staffing we have agreed in the Moneypoint and Erne stations and all the best practice agreements we are now putting in place meet best international practice. A number of stations are not yet concluded but we intend to do that.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I welcome Mr. McManus and his colleagues. Mr. McManus referred to the opening of the full market and he gave examples of Aughinish and Tynagh. My understanding is that the best new interim price for electricity is approximately 6.6 cents and the price for the renewable energy feed-in tariff is 5.7 cents for large wind farms. Is that correct? My understanding is that in respect of Aughinish and Tynagh, the ESB will market the surplus product into its grid system. Will they get 6.6 cents of the cost back?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I will pass that question to Mr. Aidan O'Regan, our head of regulatory affairs. The Senator is correct that there are long-term contracts between the ESB and Aughinish and Tynagh. That was the only way the regulator could get someone other than the ESB to build a plant. It was his determination to do that. As regards the best new interim price, I will ask Mr. O'Regan to answer that question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The way in which contracts are constructed is based on a pool price. It was envisaged that those two plants would come into operation on the basis of a pool similar to that in the UK. The ESB was contracted to do that on the basis that it offered a certain floor price to those generators to ensure they earned a particular rate of return on their investment. If they were able to sell above that floor price, they could offer their output to the pool. The ESB was a backstop to ensure those generators were held.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	344	My understanding is that the CHP plant, which would have been provided in Aughinish Alumina at considerable cost, would be used for their own resources and the excess capacity would be taken into the grid. Am I correct that it would only be taken in when the ESB needed it, such as at peak times? The deal may not necessarily be viable now for Aughinish Alumina.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It has less market risk than any type of independent power producer that has to build the plant and offer it to a pool. The ESB is offering a certain floor price for that generator.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Is that 6.6 cents?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	349	That price will be determined by the price of fuel at any given time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The issue for anyone developing a project is based on the capital and operational costs and the return they expect. It is based on a view of the market they will have in the future. Up to now, all the wind projects under the AER programme have been given a fixed contract by the ESB based on open competition. The prices have been set. The competition was run by the Department.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I have read many articles by enlightened people about wind energy and the fact that it is the way forward. The ESB and the Government talk about wind energy and the fact that the rate will be 13.2% by 2010. Is the ESB interested in wind energy?We had this discussion in the past. I will provide an example in respect of this matter that relates to west Limerick. I have given these facts to the regulator who is supposed to come back with the information. Planning approval was given over four years ago and an ESB grid application was made in November 2001. It has now been accepted into the gate one category. However, by the time the ESB goes through the planning process in terms of what it wants to install and sorts out the way-leave, it could take a further three years. The lifetime of the planning application will be at an end by then. The enthusiasm of the people who were originally encouraged to become involved in the project will have dissipated. The project may not be viable now. The terminology, such as gate one and gate two, may be right but impediments seem to be put in front of people who want to enter the wind energy market. The ESB is a vital component because the people must get into its grid system. I will not elaborate any further because I know the information was circulated to the Chairman and members.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The document which was circulated was addressed to the Chairman of the committee and has been published. The Senator can refer to it.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	358	That is correct. I do not want to quote it chapter and verse but it highlights the level of procrastination and the fact that assistance or encouragement was not given. If that encapsulates the view of other wind projects around the country, which I believe it does, I question the seriousness of the intention to get involved in wind energy.
#MichaelCollins	unknown-#MichaelCollins-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I support Senator Finucane. I understand that planning permission was granted for a wind farm in September 2001 but it will expire in 2006. That project is currently fully funded. The people involved are not seeking any financial aid, they only need what was agreed with the ESB. The ESB grid application was made in November 2001 and the ESB offered a grid connection before it had secured full planning permission for the necessary ESB line. That was due to a precedent setting condition which was introduced in the planning permission by Kerry County Council, which wanted an extra bond of €250,000 for road repairs. The ESB was unhappy with that and it was appealed to An Bord Pleanála which overturned it. The ESB then expected the developer to sign the contract, which committed it to €237,000 plus VAT, and required it to make a payment of €589,000 plus VAT. While the appeal was underway, Airtricity was not reckless with its shareholders' money and it did not sign the contract until full planning permission was granted, by which time the deadline given by the ESB to sign the contract had expired. Airtricity had already paid the ESB €121,000 towards the design and planning permission application for the promised grid, which I presume will now be lost.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	360	We have sprung this on the chief executive who may not be in a position to answer questions about individual applications. There are 2,000 megawatts of wind connections to be made. It would help the committee if Mr. McManus could tell us the procedures the ESB adopts when carrying out such connections and the timeframe involved, which are at the kernel of the problem.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	361	It is difficult to answer questions on a particular case, but we will look at that case. There are two issues related to wind development. The first is that some are connected by the ESB national grid, which is ring-fenced from the ESB and will be the future Airgrid, and some smaller connections are handled by networks. I will ask Mr. John Shine, our director of networks, to address the procedure by which people can get connected.We have extensive issues in terms of planning permission, as have wind farm developers. We must go through many difficulties, objections and appeals when trying to secure planning permission for specific projects. However, there are approximately 1,300 megawatts of wind connections which can go ahead.The size of the ESB grid must be balanced in terms of the amount of wind which can go in the system and the regulator is looking at that on an ongoing basis. I will ask Mr. John Shine, our director of networks, to address the question of how the applications which come to the ESB, as opposed to those which go to Airgrid and over which we do not have any control, are handled.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	362	It is important to remember that in a short space of time more than 300 megawatts have been connected. We have offers for a further 600 megawatts and many more are being processed. There has been a virtual explosion in trying to deal with this issue. As Mr. McManus said, some are connected to the grid system and many are connected to the distribution system.We are responsible for the processing. When the explosion in applications and interest in wind connections emerged, a process had to be put in place to try to bring order to it. The CER developed the system of gates one and two. We could spend time trying to debate that but, while no system is perfect, it has been accepted by most wind developers. Some speakers mentioned a specific case around which there may be legal issues. It is probably not appropriate, therefore, to discuss it.When offers are made, deadlines are set. We do not set the deadlines, the process is designed by the CER. We work to standard costs, which is a recent development, to make it simple for applicants to prepare their proposals and for us to cost them, to speed up that end of it and to average it out. All those costs have been benchmarked by independent consultants from the UK. While it is possible to find individual examples which may not look right, on average we have produced a system which is fair for the overall development of wind in this country.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	364	That is fine.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I will give Mr. McManus an opportunity to examine the document put before him and to revert to the committee. I would be grateful if he could respond to the Deputy and Senator from the same constituency on the issues raised in the document. Perhaps he could set out the process for wind connections and tell us if there is a twin cable approach whereby the planning application is submitted and the ESB does its work. We want to understand the process because we receive documentation from different Deputies about wind farms which have or are about to get planning permission. We do not want to use all the committee's time bringing in individuals when it is an issue between them and the networks.

A number of us do not have the opportunity to talk to the company before us. It is the fourth or fifth time this has happened and it is not acceptable.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	373	It is acceptable and I can tell the Deputy why.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	374	It is not acceptable. Our first responsibility is as Members of the Dáil. Both Deputy Durkan and I have duties as Whips and other duties, particularly a day away from a postal strike. It is outrageous that this meeting was organised at the same time. This happens all the time and it is unacceptable.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The committee decided on this day.

He should show some respect for some of the primary spokespersons here who do not get a chance to do their business at this committee.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	379	The committee decided to have an all day energy session on 2 November. We had to give due notice to all those participating to ensure their schedules agreed with that. This is the normal day for our slot as a committee.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	380	We spent an hour and a half with an academic here this morning and we have the ESB and IBEC before us now. We could have had these meetings this morning.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	381	The schedule was arranged to coincide with the schedules of those appearing before us. I am not responsible for what happens outside of the House. We arranged and agreed this meeting approximately a month ago. The Deputy may blow gas if he likes, but that is the position.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	This is the third or fourth time the Chairman has called committee meetings when we have had questions. That is not acceptable, nor is it the proper way to run a committee.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I call Deputy Eamon Ryan.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	384	We are engaged in the process of looking at long-term energy policy. Would Mr. McManus agree that because a grid exists for 30 to 100 years — some of our plants are 40 years old — we need to take a long-term view on energy policy? Some of the decisions we make now will have consequences in 30 or 40 years. Would Mr. McManus agree with that as a principle of energy policy?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I do not have any difficulty with that.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Let us take up to 2050 as our long-term policy year or target. Given the inevitable or imminent peak in global oil and gas production by that time and the effects this will have on the costs of those fuels, and given the related issue of climate change and that Governments across Europe agree that we must reduce emissions by 60% to 80% by 2050, what is the future for electricity? Where will we get our electricity in 2050? What future scenario does Mr. McManus see developing?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I suppose 2050 is a long way away. We must try and forecast from the different technologies being examined. Whether we like it, much of our equipment comes from America. America has looked at the situation and decided that for the next 300 years it will get its electricity from nuclear, clean coal technology and renewables. It has supplies of coal for 300 years and has decided it will burn it and intends to develop clean coal technology to do this. The American view is that if it takes 15 years to develop clean coal technology through which it can capture the CO2, that is what it should do. I suspect small countries such as ours will buy that technology.The other potential for the development of electricity is hydrogen but it must be developed. There are no hydrogen mines or stores of hydrogen, we must make it and currently that is very expensive. Time will tell if there is further development in that technology. We must just wait and see.With regard to the forecasts as to when oil and gas will run out, the first forecast as to when we would reach peak production of oil was 1997 but we have not reached it yet. It is reasonable to assume that oil will run out during this century and gas some 20 or 30 years afterwards. The options the bigger players are considering in the long-term for electricity supply over that period are nuclear, coal and renewables.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	This country has limited amounts of coal and last week the Minister adamantly ruled out nuclear energy. Does Mr. McManus not think therefore that for us the development of renewables by 2050 is our brightest prospect? We had a presentation this morning on the potential from wave, tidal and biomass energy. There are 21 different renewable energies available to us, all indigenous. Let us forget about 300 years into the future because for the next 3 billion years the sun will shine and provide endless energy.I am surprised that Mr. McManus only mentioned renewables in passing as a third part of the triumvirate of nuclear, clean coal and renewables. In terms of security of supply, price and cleanliness are renewables not the future for this country?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	389	There is a long answer to that, but I will try and keep my answer as short as possible. If we look at the slide I showed demonstrating the cost base for electricity generation across Europe, Ireland can be optimistic about the future in the medium-term. I must look at the next ten years as well as looking at up to 2050. The future for Ireland must be greater interconnection; we must make Ireland part of a bigger marketplace. If we manage to create a bigger marketplace, there will be far more scope for us to develop renewables.Currently, wind is our major renewable resource. I am not saying there is not potential for wave and biomass energy, but we must be realistic and consider the percentage of electricity they can produce. A country like Ireland does not have the resources to carry out research and development into wave and biomass energy. We must follow technology in that area and must try to build as many of those renewables into the system as we can. Fundamentally, we must be part of a bigger marketplace to develop renewable wind energy — our main renewable resource — on a greater scale.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	If I asked some of the ESB's competitors, for example Mr. O'Connor from Airtricity, the same question, he might say that Airtricity would build an offshore grid connecting the North Sea to Ireland through offshore wind farms. One could power Europe with the power available to us and I believe in that vision of the future. Mr. McManus is talking that down. He speaks for the short term and has nothing positive to say about renewables. Is that not the attitude that permeates the ESB and leads to the type of situations about which Senator Finucane spoke? The ESB simply does not believe in wind energy and, therefore, will not invest in it as a long-term future.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I reject that. I must be practical. People may say they can power the entire universe with wind power and we have heard those proposals but they are very expensive proposals.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	It is cheaper than gas.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The biggest difficulty I am faced with is the price of electricity. If we were to build wind farms in the Atlantic or off the Arklow Bank to any great extent, considerable costs would be associated with doing so. Ireland cannot afford those costs. We must be realistic about the level to which we can develop renewables as part of our overall framework. The idea that we could power the entire resources of Ireland on wind energy is not practical.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	394	It is not an ideal, the reality is that the only long-term sustainable future will come from the fusion reactor in the sky, the sun. It powers the wind, makes the grass grow and provides solar power. It is there forever. Mr. McManus says this is an idealistic, stupid vision but the only certainty with regard to energy is that it is the long-term future because it will not deplete. He says he must ensure Ireland is not exposed, but is it not clear that our 90% import dependency on fossil fuels is the greatest economic risk?Mr. McManus has said he wants to have 25% development of renewables. Why then has he not developed the offshore project for which the ESB got planning permission on the Kish Bank? Why has the ESB not got any biomass project in operation? Why is it not investing in wave or tidal technology or in the range of solar PV? Where does the ESB get its policy in this regard? Does it come from Government or from management?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The ESB must be practical when managing the power requirements of the country. The argument that Ireland and Europe could be powered by renewables is a dream. The cost of building wind farms in the ocean and of cabling the power back to Ireland is so expensive that it is not viable at the moment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The cost of gas has doubled in the past year. Will it double again?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Who knows where the price of fuel will go? People always anticipate that if there is stability in the areas of the world from where fossil fuels come, prices might reduce because the belief is that they are at unusually high levels, but who knows?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	398	When I consider history I can see the cost of renewable sources of energy heading in only one direction, downwards on a steady predictable trend. If Ireland were to invest in some of those technologies would we not get some of the gains that Denmark is now getting from its early investment in those technologies in jobs and in cheap and renewable energy supplies?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The Deputy should look at the slide showing what is happening in Scandinavia. While the Scandinavian countries have invested heavily in wind energy, they have huge hydro resources to back this up. They are also interconnected to the mainland of Europe through Germany. When the Scandinavian wind does not blow those countries have adequate back-up supplies. We are an isolated island and there is only a certain amount of wind we can carry here.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Mr. McManus has suggested that clean coal would be a solution for this country as that is what the Americans are doing. He also seems to imply throughout his presentation that we should go nuclear. Is that his view?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	401	No, I did not imply that. I want to make it very clear, I said that countries with nuclear power are not affected by the cost of oil and gas. We have a policy not to develop nuclear power. It is very difficult to see how we could reach the prices they can achieve as they have nuclear power.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	402	It is much more expensive than offshore wind or any of the other major tried and tested renewable sources of power.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Those who have nuclear plants at the moment are benefiting hugely in terms of cheap electricity when compared with those of us that rely on fossil fuels.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	404	They have a government subsidy.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The subsidy relates to the decommissioning cost which has always been an issue. However, the nuclear industry is still growing and we will not be part of that and cannot take account of it. Electricity in France is so much cheaper than it is in Ireland because 90% of its generation costs are independent of the price of oil and gas.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I will call Deputy O'Malley followed by Deputy Durkan. Is that acceptable to Deputy Broughan?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	407	It would be wonderful if I had the gift of bilocation. Perhaps the ESB could help me in that regard.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Perhaps we can call on Mr. Spock to get the Deputy beamed up.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I thank Deputy O'Malley. I welcome the delegation. Many people were looking forward to the market opening in February. Has anybody seen any impact? Mr. O'Connor of Airtricity mentioned that his company was ready to supply and some of the other companies such as Viridian were mentioned earlier. Effectively, however, household consumers only have the ESB.Regarding the all-island market, I take the point that Mr. McManus made about the advantages countries like Denmark and Finland have because of the contiguous relationship with other huge energy markets when developing their wind power. They even have the backup of strategies like nuclear power, which is unacceptable to us. Mr. McManus seems to be critical of the Northern Ireland market. Is the ESB in the same position as other energy companies in the Republic in that it is being maltreated by the incumbent in the North? Is that part of the problem or is there a problem with the structure of regulation? What is the problem with the North? This morning we heard about the higher prices in Northern Ireland. How will it pan out in 2007 when we have the all-island market?Mr. McManus referred to the 200,000 houses built or in the process of being built in the past three years, a matter we have discussed in other contexts in politics recently. However, we still have homeless people and others struggling to get a home. Obviously the network delivers electricity to the 370,000 new customers. However, is any choice of energy supplier given to those with new household and commercial connections?In recent interviews with representatives of the ESB, some journalists may have got the wrong end of the stick. They asked how ESB's senior management saw its long-term future. We have heard the Minister's view and obviously my party has a very strong view about the State infrastructure including the generators remaining in State hands. How would Mr. McManus answer some critics who would claim that the marginal cost of generation is a problem for the ESB if we really want to reduce prices?Some of the delegation may have been present for the previous presentation, which members found frightening as they listened to industrial icons such as Intel, Tara Mines and Wellman refer to the increase in electricity prices. In each of the past three years since I became my party's spokesperson we have suffered a whammy. Obviously the gas price increase this year was much worse. For householders what used to be a reasonable ESB bill has now become a very serious imposition, particularly on low-income vulnerable households given that we have always had significant fuel poverty.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I emphasise the points made by the Deputy regarding IBEC and the major captains of industry that have compared electricity costs in this country unfavourably with those in France and various other countries. We are at the top of the league. While I am sure the representatives of the ESB referred to this matter before we arrived, we could not be in two places at one time. There is an urgent need to tackle the issues at a fundamental level and try to bring our costs into line to some extent.I also emphasise the need to exploit alternative sources of energy to the maximum possible limits. I do not agree with the notion of only having a long-term policy, there must be short, medium and long-term policies on energy which should be updated annually. Otherwise it will not be possible to bridge the gap between requirements and production. It would be very dangerous to go down only one road and I would strongly advise against it. Unless we do this some morning people will plug in their kettles to find no purr from the kettle and only from the cat.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The residential market is fully open and anybody can choose to move to any supplier in a matter of days, which is not the case in Northern Ireland — a matter to which I will return shortly. For us operating in Northern Ireland and for Viridian and other players here the reality is that new entrants want to get the big users of electricity first. It is only when those players in the marketplace have sated themselves or got as many of the big users in the market as they can that they will go after residential customers. This is the way markets have developed in all European countries that have been liberalised. At the moment the new entrants are still chasing industrial, retail and commercial customers as opposed to residential customers. It is only when they feel they have gone as far as they can go that they will move to the residential sector. It will take more time before people in the residential sector will see competition at that level. At least all the mechanisms are in place to allow them to do so.In Northern Ireland, for example, if we want to get a customer to move to ESB we must pay for the charge of the metering. It is necessary to pay approximately £300 to have a meter changed which we believe is anti-competitive. The major issue in Northern Ireland is the lack of transparency in the regulatory process. Our concern is that lack of transparency could continue not just for the next few years but also when the all-island marketplace is developed. We want the same level of transparency North and South. We want the same level of open competition North and South.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I imagine there would be a single EirGrid, if one likes, in this regard. However, given that two jurisdictions are involved the likelihood is that for the medium-term there would be one regulator. However, there is no reason it could not change in the future.The issue of prices was raised by IBEC and we have discussed the matter already. We must create downward pressure on the price of electricity but we cannot do anything about the price of fuel in the short and medium-term. However, we can create a bigger marketplace. We believe the all-island marketplace alone, which provides greater backstop regarding supply, will reduce the price of electricity by approximately 4%. If we continue to interconnect directly to the UK we will create a much bigger marketplace. Those are the kinds of things that will bring downward pressure on the price of electricity in a country like Ireland.Creating that level of interconnection and thereby a bigger marketplace would provide the opportunity to include more wind energy into a much bigger system. It would allow far greater opportunities for wind energy developers to proceed with their developments.

The slot allocated to this committee is Wednesday at 2.30 p.m. Today's clash occurred as the Dáil decided not to sit yesterday, Tuesday, owing to the public holiday. Therefore today's Order of Business takes place this afternoon. Furthermore, as the minutes of the joint committee meeting of 5 October record, members agreed to have today's meeting at this time. At the time this was agreed it was understood that the Dáil would be in recess this week. If the committee were to accommodate the Deputy this meeting should have been cancelled. We scheduled Mr. Howley and Dr. Ó Gallachóir to appear this morning to allow them to return to Cork this evening. It was ideal, as the diaries for IBEC and the ESB were not free so that these groups needed to present this afternoon. This schedule was agreed with the Whips.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	434	That is for the record. I welcome Deputy Fiona O'Malley to the committee and we will hear from her at last.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I am grateful to be able to speak here today. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Eamon Ryan about the attitude and the absence of ambition in looking to guarantees for the future. Renewable sources represent certainty. Where we live we are best located for wind power. Mr. McManus mentioned Denmark and the need for a certain base load but Denmark has nothing like the potential for wind energy we have.I find this so disappointing. As Deputy Ryan said, when considering a strategy for 2050 we should be much more open to the possibilities for renewable sources of energy. While I stand to be corrected, since the regulator was appointed the ESB no longer has responsibility for fuel security. Is that correct?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	436	That is correct.

I am not sure how long it is since representatives of the ESB last appeared before the committee. The ESB has built two fantastic peat-burning stations, meaning they were terribly expensive. They still consume fossil fuels and will not help us meet our targets for reducing carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. I am disappointed that the ESB is not ambitious in pursuing renewable energy sources. I encourage its representatives to open their minds to it. The wind flows free. I agree that the capital costs are high. A year ago the price of gas and oil were considerably lower and we cannot be sure where they will go. I urge the ESB to change its thinking slightly.I want to ask about interconnectivity. If we were able to generate electricity offshore and particularly from wind sources we would need to be able to sell it. I did not get the sense that interconnectivity was inevitable. Does the ESB not regard it as a great opportunity?What is the average wage in the ESB? I have heard tell that generation capacity is not being met across the board in the ESB. I ask the witnesses to bear with me while I elaborate on this point. It is in the ESB's interest not to operate to capacity as the less electricity generated the higher the price is. Does the ESB believe this is true?Mr. McManus mentioned he was not happy with the regulatory system in Northern Ireland. Does this mean he is happy with the regulatory system in a liberalised market in the South? Following deregulation, the ESB is the biggest incumbent and also owns the grid. It is 90% of the way towards separating the ESB national grid, EirGrid, from the ESB. Would it be better to allow generation to be split from the ESB and become a discrete branch and allow the rest to become separate at a future date to be determined? The ESB should be the same as any other generator and the only way to do so is by separating the generation capacity from the rest of the ESB.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I ought to clarify this matter. There seems to be a belief that the ESB is opposed to wind energy; it is not. We are developing wind energy projects ourselves. In an island economy with limited interconnection, as we have, people must accept that the wind blows free but it does not blow all the time. Members should imagine the coldest day of the year in wintertime when we need maximum electricity; there is no wind.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Deputy O'Malley is right. We have some of the world's leading resources in terms of wind and wave energy. Has Mr. McManus ever heard of electricity generated by biomass, tidal wave power, CHP, combined heat and power, or a myriad of other resources?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	440	We do not have the best tidal resources.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	447	It is not limited ambition; it is practical.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	448	Mr. McManus may answer all the questions without interruption.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	449	We must take a practical approach to wind energy because the wind does not blow all the time. In winter the wind profile is not great. We can develop wind energy only to the level that can be handled on a small system. We can develop it to a greater extent by pushing ahead with interconnection directly to the United Kingdom and by developing an all-island marketplace. We have always supported both initiatives and continue to do so but that is an issue for the Government and the regulator. We will strongly support any initiatives taken which will allow greater security of supply and development of the wind energy industry. That is the way to do it. The ESB will develop wind energy resources but will never be a dominant player in the market. We support its development and want to see its potential realised.Deputy O'Malley mentioned the figure for the average wage which has been publicised in the newspapers at approximately €70,000. Traditionally, across Europe those involved in utilities are paid more than the industrial wage. Unlike other industries, many of those involved do shift work and have call-out duties to repair faults and breakdowns. In the 1980s the ESB had 13,500 staff for its core business at home. Today, when the system is twice the size it was at the time, we have 7,000 staff with a total of 8,500 in the group.By any standard, the ESB's productivity is exceptional. People are quick to produce EUROSTAT statistics on many issues. The statistics show that the level of productivity of utilities in Ireland is one of the highest in Europe. Our action is aimed at improving the cost base and efficiency has been exceptional. We have nothing to hide in that regard.Deputy O'Malley suggested that in some way we would not run generation facilities. We would never leave anyone short at any stage unless there was nothing we could do about it. I will ask Mr. Pat O'Doherty, our executive director of generation, to give a brief answer to that question.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Does Mr. McManus wish to respond to other questions?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Yes, I will deal with them. We can then return to the previous issue.It is not a question of whether we are happy or unhappy about regulation but of transparency. The regulatory process is transparent and everything that happens is included in the website for all to see. That is not the case in Northern Ireland. That is the problem.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	452	IBEC holds a different view on that point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	453	Responsibility for security of supply, which now resides with the regulator, previously resided with us. Each year the regulator, supported by ESB National Grid through its annual generation adequacy planning process, produces an updated five year plan. On that basis there will be no shortage of generation capacity in the coming winter. Based on new entrants, Aughinish and Tynagh, and the planned Huntstown 2 investment project, there will be no shortage of generating capacity in the next four or five years.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	454	There are several questions to come. I will call Deputy Fitzpatrick and then finish up because we have run overtime and there may be a vote on the Order of Business. Deputy Broughan would object if I did not turn up to vote.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The Chairman could tell him to vote on his behalf.

He said €3 billion had been spent on infrastructure in recent years. Is he wearing both hats? Was this money spent on the generation and transmission systems?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	As the assets belong to the ESB, the investment is made across the board.
#DermotFitzpatrickFF	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-party	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-dob	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Does Mr. McManus think the regulatory system works in favour of the consumer, given that the scale of the market in the Republic is relatively small and expensive to enter, such that no company will enter unless it obtains a reasonable return on its money? We heard the icons of industry worry about the cost of electricity but the first thing my constituents and everybody else show me is the ESB bill. They can go through the minutiae of it, asking what each charge is for, such as the public service charge.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	459	It is not for me to comment on whether the regulatory system is good or bad. We must operate within it. When the Irish market was liberalised and the regulatory system put in place, the cost of electricity was at the bottom of the European ladder. That was sustained only because the ESB had not invested any money for 15 years but that could not continue. When it had to rebuild the network, fuel prices went through the roof. The environmental problem of carbon dioxide was added to the burden. Several factors have worked against the electricity market in Ireland in the past four years. Regardless of what system was in place, those issues had to be addressed.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	If fuel prices drop, will the ESB drop its prices like other private generators?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	461	We do not have control over that matter. If fuel prices drop, the price of electricity will drop. That is the regulator's decision, as he has already made clear.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I wish to put some questions before calling Deputy Ryan again. Is Mr. Shine in charge of networks?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Correct.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I have a general account statement in front of me. I asked my secretary to ring the number 1850 372 372 yesterday. It took 55 seconds for her to hear a recorded message and four minutes and 58 seconds before she could speak to an operator. I then asked her to ring the emergency interruptions faults number, 1850 372 999. It took one minute and 12 seconds to hear a recorded message and three minutes and 12 seconds to speak to an operator. Is that the way to deal with customers? Does Mr. Shine have any plans to change this voicemail system to a proper human contact system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Our networks and supply business use the services of the national contact centre. The chief executive has mentioned that with the market opening up, we have put in place a new system and I acknowledge there have been difficulties. This has meant a learning curve for customers and our own staff. There has been a huge increase in call volumes. This year we expect about 3.5 million calls, or 12,000 daily. Clearly, individual problems arise. The Chairman mentioned one that occurred yesterday. On the positive side, to help solve some of our difficulties we have contracted the services of ABTRAN which has about 90 call agents. We are also in the process of recruiting an additional 40 staff to deal with the issue. I am confident we will clear the backlog of queries. This time last year the average call duration, following customer contact with a call centre agent, was about two minutes. Now, for a number of reasons associated with market opening and the fact that customers must now have their own meter point reference number, MPRN, the average call duration is four minutes. With 3.5 million calls and a doubling of average call duration, one can see we are faced with an almost unprecedented situation.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Perhaps Mr. Shine did not understand my question. I could always contact the ESB call centre at Wilton and a voice operator would answer. How long is it since that system was changed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	471	We changed over about five years ago. The call centre is based in Wilton.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	473	There have been a number of changes and modifications. The move from local call answering to a centralised system took place about five years ago.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	474	What good news can we give the people with regard to getting an answer to a telephone account query or, more importantly, an emergency call? If one dials 999, it is answered immediately.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	475	As I stated, networks and our supply business can avail of the services of the national contract centre. In an emergency there is a specific number to call. We recognise there is an issue because of the sheer volume of calls and their complexity. We have availed of the services of an outside company and are recruiting additional staff. Our own staff work very hard. Anyone who has seen the operation knows how professional the service is. We were told that when one installed such a new system the productivity of the existing system decreased by about 40%. That is the internationally accepted standard. We put a great effort into preparing ourselves for this. We are determined to achieve best practice. I hope we will do so in the next few months.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	476	We shall keep an eye on it. This does not refer only to the ordinary consumer but affects the entire business spectrum. Businesses trying to make new connections are not able to do so. Nobody seems to be available. Nobody wants to give out the appropriate mobile phone or work number, even to business people conducting business on an ongoing basis. Looking in from the outside, with all due respect, it appears that it is very difficult to make contact with a human being in the ESB. This is what is happening all around the country. As public representatives, we might have a better opportunity to make contact with officials in the ESB network system, but as can be shown — Mr. Shine can check this tomorrow — it is impossible to make contact regarding an emergency or an outage such as occurred in Blarney last Friday week. Fortunately, we received a telephone call from Mr. Shine's office to alert us to what had happened and the fact that consumers had not been notified in time. In my constituency we receive many calls if there is a power outage. I am sure other Members have encountered the same difficulties.I note that the ESB is now generating only 45% of the electricity used in this country and that the market will be opened in 2007. I presume anyone can now change suppliers. If the customer is king, I am asking Mr. Shine to respect this by putting in place a system under which one can speak to a human voice.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I do not think any politician will go down the route of having an answering machine, informing a constituent with a housing problem to press button No. 1 or with a health problem to press button No. 2.Some of the most important work in the Houses of the Oireachtas is done at the committees. While it is important that we attend the Order of Business in the Chamber, the work done at the committees, while unnoticed, is significant. As an Opposition Deputy, I have found it useful to be able to question delegates such as Mr. McManus.Further to what Deputies O'Malley and Fitzpatrick said, Mr. McManus indicated that "we" had invested in the transmission and distribution systems and were doing this, that and the other. There was no sense of separation between the delegates. The fact that they all are housed in the same building and that there has been an inability to separate the two companies is remarkable. If we are heading towards a competitive market, it is impossible for a competitor to believe he or she is competing on a level playing field if the distribution and transmission company is not separate from the generation company. When will they be separated? Why are they not being separated? Why does Mr. McManus constantly use the word "we"?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I do not know when the two companies will be separated. That is an issue for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources as well as EirGrid. We all hope the separation will take place soon. Many difficulties arose, which I will not rehash. Every one is determined to have the two companies separated as soon as possible.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The two remaining issues to be dealt with are the operating arrangements between the ESB and EirGrid which have now been resolved and the negotiations with staff on the move from the ESB to the new company. That process has been referred to conciliation and has not been completed. We hope the matter will soon be resolved.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I am not sure what the share ownership issue has to do with it, but the negotiations involve those who will leave the ESB and move to the new company, EirGrid. The issues raised by the staff include the fact that they will be moving from a company with 8,500 workers to one which will have about 200 and where their opportunities will be much more limited. Therefore, the staff who are moving feel they are being disadvantaged. There is also the issue of the pensions fund in a company with 200 workers as opposed to one with 8,500. The answer to the Deputy's question is yes.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I would have thought that a power transmission company would possibly have the most secure pension arrangement on the planet. Is it true a payment of up to €50,000 is being sought for such a transfer?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I am not aware of the figure being mentioned but, because the matter has been referred to conciliation, I cannot discuss it.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	485	That is understandable.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	486	That the process has continued for four years is not understandable.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Is it not understandable monetary amounts cannot be discussed while negotiations are ongoing?

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I will ask our director of generation to address that issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Does Deputy Ryan's question concern plant availability?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	491	At our last meeting it was noted that the level was in the mid-70s.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	492	It is currently 82% to 83% across the portfolio.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	493	What is the target?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Our target is to reach a figure of 86% in the next two years. Many of our plants are operating above the level for best practice. While some of our hydro and gas plants as well as our CCGT plant in Poolbeg are operating at the level of best practice and a small number are not, the level of availability across our overall portfolio is approximately 82%.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	495	At our last meeting Mr. McManus mentioned that four plants were operating at a level below best practice. Will he name them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The plants which are operating below our desired level are old Poolbeg, Great Island and Tarbert.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	497	What is the cost this year of the ESB's involvement in the European emissions trading system? How much carbon in excess of the quota is being produced and what is the likely cost? That question may be difficult to answer because the process is ongoing. What is the projected cost of next year's carbon purchases under the emissions trading system?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I will ask the finance director to address that question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Our estimated cost for the current year is in excess of €10 million. We do not know what the cost will be for the years 2006 and 2007 due to variances in volume and price. As there is no acceptable forward market or liquidity in respect of the purchase of these credits, our approach is to try to minimise the amount of emissions and devise a strategy whereby an acceptable top-up mechanism will be in place by the end of the period.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	500	What is the estimate for the tonnage base of carbon above the allocation the ESB received?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The last estimate I was given was approximately 1 million tonnes.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	502	It was reported that the ESB had bought at a lower cost per tonne. The current market price for carbon under the emissions system is approximately €25 per tonne. If there is a similar situation next year, the company could face a bill in the region of €25 million for excess carbon emissions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	503	That would be the case if the only approach was to buy EUAs rather than CERs. There is a series of mechanisms by which the obligations may be satisfied.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	504	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, does not mention those mechanisms when we discuss the cost of carbon trading under the Kyoto system, which will cost the ESB €10 million this year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	505	That is our current estimate.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Last week a plant was opened in Bilbao. What is the next foreign adventure in terms of opening plants?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	507	We have an option on a site in Southampton where we are considering the development of a similar project to the 800 MW plant in Spain but we have not yet reached financial closure.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Are further projects being considered?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Deputy will be glad to hear that we are exploring wind energy opportunities in Spain.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	511	It also blows well in Spain. We are also considering a project in Holland. With regard to the international marketplace, we have to consider two or three projects to ensure at least one is completed.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The impression was given in Mr. McManus's last presentation that the ESB was following the same business strategy to the one the AIB and Cement Roadstone Holdings had successfully adopted, that is, to maintain a dominant monopoly market position at home and to use the profits to invest in expansion overseas. Is that not a good summary of the ESB's business plan?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I do not accept that. As more than 80% of our business is regulated, we do not have the opportunity to follow the strategy the Deputy has alleged. Our international business is completely ringfenced. It is inevitable that our market share on this island will drop to 40% and, because we want the ESB to continue to grow, we are seeking opportunities overseas.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I congratulate the ESB on its joint venture in Spain and the new station it opened in Northern Ireland. We wish the company every success in these endeavours. I want to tell Mr. Shine that, while there were difficulties with regard to communications barriers, a fantastic service is provided by ESB support staff on the ground and network engineers in making repairs and providing assistance. Mr. Tom Flanagan and Ms Mary Maguire in Cork are doing superb jobs.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	515	That applies throughout the country.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	516	With regard to the outages in the south east last night, will others be experienced or was a technical fault or network failure to blame?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Mr. McManus noted that the European Union was moving towards the consolidation of larger utility power generation companies and implied that this move was supported by national policies for regulation systems. Has the ESB been approached by any international utility company with regard to co-operation or shares offers? Does consolidation present any threats to the ESB's operations in Ireland or internationally?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	518	We have not been approached with regard to co-operation in Ireland. However, we have been approached on a number of occasions with regard to overseas projects. As we look for partners when developing such projects, we have contacts with a lot of companies.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I understand the restrictions on the ESB in building new stations present difficulties for the company. I ask for Mr. McManus' view on the matter. Does the ESB have any plans to fire peat with biomass, a more carbon neutral fuel?Is security of supply mainly the responsibility of the ESB? If so, should it be passed to the Commission for Energy Regulation? Do long-term issues arise in this regard of which we should be aware?IBEC which is not satisfied that the ESB is providing best value for money or is as efficient as a privately owned company made some points with regard to an audit. However, it also conceded that most of its members were not customers of the ESB but contracted with other energy suppliers. If the ESB is the main energy supplier, why have IBEC's members taken their custom elsewhere?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	520	We had weather related difficulties in County Wexford which resulted in power outages for several hundred customers from lunchtime yesterday. The Chairman's question may relate to the call we received from Wexford General Hospital at 8 p.m. last night. Upon investigation of the matter, we discovered that there was a problem with the hospital's equipment whereby the auto-changeover for its standby generator attempted to operate. The ESB's contracts organisation worked late into the night to resolve this and other problems. This morning it was implied on radio that the problem lay with the ESB, but the hospital has since clarified that its equipment was at fault.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	521	My thanks to Mr. Shine for that clarification. We are aware of the work carried out by network staff during the terrible storms of the past few years. I recall in particular a storm one Christmas but my house escaped a power cut, which was just as well as we had a large number of people coming for dinner.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	522	We would like to be able to address the issue of renewables to a greater degree. It must be understood that this is a small country and we are a small company in the electricity sector. Ireland cannot afford to be a leader in research and development of some of these technologies but that does not mean we would not——
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Why?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The best companies in the world spent a significant percentage of their resources on research and development.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	525	They are companies involved in the development of new products. If one reflects on the investment required to develop new technologies for companies, those technologies are developed by equipment suppliers, not by utilities. It would not be a practical proposition for a utility such as the ESB to spend a large amount of money on developing technologies. I do not believe the regulator would allow us do that. The makers and suppliers of equipment carry out research and development in the electricity sector, not the utilities because they would not burden their customers with such costs. We will seek opportunities to develop the renewables agenda but we must do so in a responsible way taking account of the overall management of the system. That is what I would like to see happen.Regarding big customers which IBEC indicated were not customers of the ESB, when new suppliers enter the market — I must admit the position is the same in Northern Ireland — they immediately go after the big customers. They are the customers to whom they can offer good deals and discounts on published tariffs. The ESB's tariffs are published. Regarding independent suppliers, of which the ESB also has one, they can offer discounts. When new suppliers enter the market the first people they go after are the biggest users of electricity and they offer them the most discount.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Is the ESB being disadvantaged or can it offer similar discounts?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	527	To an extent, "disadvantaged" is not the right word. There must be scope for new players to develop and we accept that. The regulator is allowing that to happen. I do not count it as being disadvantaged. Our regulatory affairs manager, Mr. Aidan O'Regan, might speak on that.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	528	If the company is a generator, as efficient as Mr. McManus has said it is and is producing energy at the same cost as private operators, which Mr. McManus indicated is the position, I cannot understand how the company can allow other suppliers to cherry-pick and that it does not intervene to win back or retain the business.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	529	We made a commitment to reduce our market share. We were to reduce it to 60% which, effectively, we have achieved. In the context of an all-Ireland market, as the chief executive explained, our market share would fall to 40% or thereabouts.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I take it the company is obliged to do that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Yes, and on the back of that a number of generators have come into the market and built their businesses.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I take it the company serves most of the individual consumers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	533	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Mr. Shine might indicate the percentage of consumers that have moved to another supplier.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The number in the domestic sector is still small. Airtricity would have quite a number but the other suppliers have not gone after that market. An interesting statistic is that approximately 200 customers change supplier every day. We have systems in place that allow customers to change from one supplier to another. We are processing approximately 200 such changes a day, approximately 1,000 a week, which on the scale of what people would like in terms of competition is still small but it is happening.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Hopefully those customers will return to the company. Something similar was experienced by Eircom.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	537	On the industrial and commercial side, that happens from time to time. There are annual contracts involved. It is too early to say that in terms of the sectors where suppliers pursue the smaller commercial or domestic customers.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Does the ESB impose a special charge to change metres?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	539	There are certain charges, but in terms of a change of supplier, that is made as simple and is done as speedily as possible. We have a target to do that within so many days. The systems to which I referred have given rise to many points of issue that have been the subject of calls but the systems are in place to facilitate such a change.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I wish to deal with the question of the future of the ESB. I did not get a direct answer to my question about whether the break-up should be about separating generation from the rest of the business. I discovered only last week what the grid is. I had thought it was the wires, but it is not. Am I right in understanding it is the capacity to switch on and off generation, by and large, what is in the computer control room currently located at huge expense in Fitzwilliam Street but which is about to be relocated when a separation of the businesses takes place? The separation process has been ongoing for four years. Mr. McManus mentioned that it is an issue for the Department, but why is that the case?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	541	To answer the question in its totality, my commitment, and that of the ESB, is to retain the ESB as a strong vertically integrated utility. Nobody has ever proved to me that doing something different would reduce the price of electricity. I pose the question as to whether separating the generation from the ESB would reduce the price of electricity? Nobody has demonstrated to me that it would. I am committed to the ESB meeting its obligations in terms of a share of the market and having a 40% to 45% share of the overall electricity market on an all-island basis but in that context retaining the ESB right through the system from the generation to supply. That is the trend in Europe.The grid is the wires. What Deputy O'Malley referred to is the control centre. Separation is one aspect, but de facto that separation is in place. The board of the ESB has no control over the national grid.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I know that is the case.

Given there is a liberalised market, the company must have that clear separation. It is not good enough to have a corridor, so to speak, through which one can no longer go.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	545	No independents have ever come to me and complained about the treatment they have got from the ESB.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Where would they go? The regulator and EirGrid have also said no independents have ever complained about the degree of separation that exists between EirGrid and the ESB.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Has the European Commission made any comments about that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The European Commission will require legal separation in 2007; it does not require ownership separation. There is a clear distinction between both. What will take place regarding the separation of the networks entity is that there will be a subsidiary or a legal entity set up apart from the generation side. In the five years since the question of the market opening has been raised, the issue of the ESB's ability to manipulate competition has never been raised with us in any forum; the position has been to the contrary. If people understood how the system operated they would realise this is the position. EirGrid planned for the system and for all connections to the system. It effectively deals with them and they are dealt with on a totally ring-fenced basis. It is important to understand that.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Can I give an example of where the management of the grid had a huge influence? If one takes the long-term vision that the development of renewal energy rather than clean coal will be the mainstay for our future, we need to develop our grid on the basis of sourcing renewable power supply rather than chasing after the customers, as is happening at present. Those involved in the renewable industry strongly argue that what the company is doing in terms of investing in the grid is blocking the long-term development of renewables. It has invested €3 million in the grid and it is proposed to invest the same amount going forward for the next five years, which can only suit large centralised fossil fuel burning power stations. That is the reason the ownership of the grid is a matter of concern and a major problem. The same attitude the company has towards the renewables is setting the agenda for the grid, which will be there in 50 years' time when we will not have fossil fuels to burn.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I ask our director of networks to address that issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	552	As one of the ring-fenced networks, I assure the committee that ESB Networks has no involvement in the development, planning and operation of the transmission system. Obviously, we build the assets and, as our chief executive has already mentioned, we own those assets. The actual planning, development and operation of the system is ring-fenced and in all of our contacts with the regulator there has not been a single complaint about those areas.Many of the wind and renewable energy systems will be connected to both the transmission system and the distribution system. In terms of the influence, operation and so on, of renewables, the grid must have transparency. We must be able to see the amount of wind that is on the system, in terms of faults and system management, or situations where the temperature is very low but there is no wind. The grid must have an insight into such matters.It is not all doom and gloom, however. Recently we have agreed to try to encourage clustered wind developments, which we will build in an advanced way. This will involve four 110,000 volt stations in four different locations, which will facilitate wind developers coming into the system in an orderly way without massive incremental costs being incurred when they first enter. There are a number of initiatives of that type which recognise that the distribution and transmission systems have to be developed in ways that are different from the past. It is not all negative news.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Should the networks be built in specific areas, as was said this morning when Dr. O Gallachóir was here? Should the wind farms be clustered to make it easier for connection and so forth?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	554	Absolutely, that is one of the initiatives being undertaken. Originally we had a situation where somebody would decide to build a wind farm, then we would have to build a line at a certain voltage level. Then somebody else would decide to build a wind farm and that would cause a change to the system and we would have to make an even bigger investment. We are now trying to do some advanced planning around that issue and I believe it will be quite successful.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	555	Would Mr. Shine agree that a key change would be a move towards what is called a distributed grid system, where there is a myriad of small suppliers connected to the system, rather than the centralised large grid system that we have at the moment? The current system involves large power plants, such as Moneypoint, supplying power to Dublin. We should move towards a more dispersed, distributed grid system, as countries that are serious about renewable energy sources are doing now, for example, Britain. Why have we not moved towards a distributed grid system if we believe that renewable energy is the way forward?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	556	To a large degree we have a distributed grid system. We have made major advances in terms of building the 110,000 and 220,0000 volt systems around the country. Obviously, it must take account of the location of generation and so on, but we have a very extensive grid system in place. Of the €3 billion investment, €500 million was spent on transmission. There will probably be another €500 million called for by Airgrid and the regulator in the next five years. There is a large amount of distributed network development taking place and there is no reason it will not be able to accommodate renewables if and when it arrives.On the distribution side, we have one of the most extensive distribution systems in Europe. We have 170,000 km of overhead network, which creates specific challenges both in terms of weather and cost. We have four times more overhead network than any other country in Europe.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	558	Last year we connected up approximately 25,000 individual houses. The way development takes place and the fact that the population is dispersed creates a major challenge. The total number of new connections in Northern Ireland last year was 15,000. We had 90,000 new customers last year and approximately 22,000 or 23,000 of those were one-off, individual houses. That is a unique situation in Europe.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	559	What is the ratio of employees to customers? Has it changed in recent years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	560	We have 1.9 million customers and 7,000 employees. The ratio has improved significantly from the previous situation where we had 13,000 employees and 1.2 million customers.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	561	Deputy Ryan said that the policy of the ESB was to go for clean coal. I did not say that, I was trying to give an overview of what is happening in the world. There is no such thing as clean coal yet, so we have not even given it consideration.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I agree with Mr. McManus wholeheartedly.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	563	We do not have any difficulties with regard to the way in which ESB is operated. More than 80% of ESB's business is regulated so everything is on an open-book basis with the regulator. All the information is available so anyone who wants to ask the regulator about the activities of the ESB can do so because it operates on an open-book basis.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I ask Mr. McManus to deal with the question of whether the company should be allowed to build more generating plants.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	565	It is our belief that we should be able to build more plants. Once we meet the commitments we have entered into, in terms of reducing our share of the market, the ESB should be allowed to build more plants. We are progressing plans to rebuild the Aghada power station as part of that programme.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	567	We have targeted the development of 200 megawatts of wind for ESB. We believe that will make a significant contribution over the next number of years. There are already commitments to reach the 2010 target of 13% and connections have been offered for that.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	568	Is the company currently prevented from building a new power plant on a greenfield site rather than refurbishing or renewing its existing plants?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Part of the original agreement was that we would refurbish some of our existing plant, which is quite old. We have not got to a stage where we are looking at a greenfield site. These are things that will take place, step by step.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	570	Is ESB restricted by regulator from building a new plant?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	571	We certainly would need a licence from the regulator to do so.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	572	That is what I am asking. I presume the company's dominance in the market, although reducing, is the reason it has not been given a new licence.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	573	We entered into an agreement that we would reduce our market share. Part of that agreement was that we would be able to refurbish plant and we expect to hold the regulator to that commitment.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Down the line, if the next Government was to give the company specific targets, including basic renewables, that is something that the company would have to address.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	575	Yes.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	576	IBEC complained this morning that there is nothing significant on-stream after 2007 in terms of generation.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	577	That is something we will have to address at that time but we are prepared to rebuild the Aghada power plant, are making plans to do so and will be seeking approval for that project.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	578	This committee is to produce a report on energy and there is a question mark over an all-Ireland energy policy, as well as the policy for this State. It is important for the committee to know what the ESB is planning in terms of additional generation, new plants, and so on. Mr. McManus has indicated that the company is looking further afield to build new plants, in Spain and Northern Ireland, but it is being restricted here because of the rules imposed. We are interested in knowing if those rules should be changed now to accommodate the ESB and other entrants in producing and generating energy to meet the needs of the country in the future.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I believe that to be the case and that ESB would be a key part of developing new generation plant in the future. However, for the moment, the plans that we have are to develop up to 200 megawatts of wind and to re-power the Aghada power station. They are our only plans at present.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	580	It should be borne in mind that the two new plants that are coming on the system, at Tynagh and Aughinish, will effectively require the ESB to close other plants. There will be a combination of closing plant and building new plant in the future.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	581	Does Mr. O'Regan mean closing inefficient plants?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Yes.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	583	What implication will that have for jobs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	584	In any business, if there is over-capacity in the system, it must be dealt with or closed down. Obviously, in such situations we will deal with the staff and try to negotiate satisfactory outcomes.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Given the proposed development of an all-island market and perhaps the development of an east-west market, is there any possibility of exporting the over-capacity?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	586	One of the major difficulties is that we do not have over-capacity. As we do not have major external interconnections, we must keep building the system and making it attractive for others to build, although the ESB is restricted from building plant.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I thank Mr. McManus for appearing before the committee today. As agreed by the committee on 5 October, an all day meeting on energy matters will be held on Wednesday, 16 November. There will be an additional meeting at 3 p.m. next Tuesday in regard to the BlackValley, at which Deputy Broughan wants Black Valley residents to be present.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Yes.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	589	Eircom representatives will appear also. If Deputy Broughan wishes, we can drop that meeting. We will discuss three COM documents and two statutory instruments next Wednesday, which should not cause a great delay. We asked the clerk to provide an extra slot next Tuesday, which he did. While I do not know what will fall out of the sky next Monday or Tuesday morning, I take it we can proceed with the additional meeting.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I have noted the timeframe. Will there be questions on 16 November?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The dates have been set out. Matters have moved forward a day because the Dáil did not sit yesterday. The slots were agreed by members and are included in the minutes. I thank Deputy O'Malley for spending so much time at the committee.
#FionnaOMalleyPD	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#FionnaOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I thank the Chairman for allowing me to do so. When is the energy policy due to be published?
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	593	We hope to produce a draft report in the middle of January which can be published in the first quarter of the year.The joint committee adjourned at 6 p.m. sine die.
