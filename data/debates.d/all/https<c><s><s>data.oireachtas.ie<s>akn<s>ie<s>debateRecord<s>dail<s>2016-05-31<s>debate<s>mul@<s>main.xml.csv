#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together. The questions relate to two separate visits to the United States so far this year. Two relate to the St. Patrick's week visit to the United States, two relate to a further visit to the United States, and three are general in respect of visits to the United States. In March, I made a brief visit to Washington DC for the annual St. Patrick's Day programme. On 17 May, I returned to Washington for a programme of events to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising. My visit to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day period was shorter than usual this year given the political circumstances here at the time and the fact that there was a European Council meeting in Brussels that same week. The focus of my brief visit was on high-level political engagements that form part of the traditional St. Patrick's Day programme in Washington DC. I am pleased the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, was able to attend a number of important business-related events in Washington. My engagements with political leaders included talks with President Obama in the White House and a breakfast meeting with Vice President Biden. I presented President Obama with the traditional gift of a bowl of shamrock at the White House St. Patrick's Day reception. On Capitol Hill, I met the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan, in addition to a number of other congressional leaders. I attended the traditional Speaker's lunch. I also attended an Irish Embassy reception attended by representatives of the Irish-American community in addition to business, political and cultural figures. In my meetings with political leaders, I focused on a range of issues, such as Ireland–US bilateral relations, immigration reform and the forthcoming referendum in the United Kingdom on EU membership. In my remarks at the White House, Capitol Hill, the Vice President's official residence and the Irish Embassy reception, I highlighted the strength of Ireland's economy and Ireland–US trade, the important role played by the United States in the Northern Ireland peace process, the need to continue to press for action on immigration reform and the programme of 1916 Rising commemorations in the United States. I travelled to Washington again on Tuesday, 17 May to participate in a range of events planned to commemorate the centenary of the Easter Rising. That evening, I was pleased to join Vice President Biden to open formally the festival IRELAND 100: Celebrating the Centenary of Irish Arts and Culture at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This is a three week long festival of Irish theatre, music, dance and literature. It forms the centrepiece of the Government's programme of more than 250 events in the United States commemorating the 1916 Rising. The following day I attended a number of official events to mark the 1916 Rising and the role of Irish-America therein. I was honoured to be invited to plant an Irish oak tree on the grounds of the United States Congress at Capitol Hill to mark this centenary. I spoke at a reception hosted by Malin plc, a supporter of the IRELAND 100 festival, attended by representatives from the business, political and arts communities. I then visited the Library of Congress to view items from its collections related to the Rising. I also had the opportunity to visit the Newseum, an institution dedicated to promoting freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. Later I attended a reception in the National Statutory Hall of the US Capitol building to celebrate Ireland–US relations in this year, the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. I departed Washington on Wednesday evening. Over the course of a short but busy programme, I had informal encounters with a small number of elected officials, congressional leaders and representatives. Our discussions were brief and generally focused on the commemorative events. The issue of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership did not substantively arise in discussions on either short trip. In spite of the brevity of both visits, they were successful in further developing the strong political and cultural links between Ireland and the United States and promoting Ireland's priorities with the US Administration.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I jest. I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. While it is for the American people to choose their leaders and set their policies, countries are fully entitled to comment on possible developments that could impact on bilateral relations. Other governments have indicated they will not accept any attempt to impose a religion based exclusion on travel for their citizens. Will the Taoiseach follow this example? Will he confirm that Ireland will fight against any attempt to discriminate against citizens based on their religion? I am referring to comments made by Mr. Donald Trump in the US election campaign. Will he also confirm that any attempt to introduce discrimination of this nature will be viewed as a clear breach of bilateral agreements and international law and that no figure, irrespective of how powerful his or her position, would be welcome to Ireland if he or she were to attempt to implement such a policy? Will he confirm that he will not host Mr. Trump if he asks to visit Ireland as part of an attempt to moderate his image in the coming months? This is an important point given what has been taking place. I am not sure whether the Taoiseach indicated whether he discussed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, with the political leaders he met in Washington. TTIP is one of the key bilateral issues between Europe and the United States and is important for Ireland, as a member of the European Union. As with all international negotiations, the conspiracy theorists of the extreme left and right are hyperactive regarding TTIP, claiming the negotiations are about to herald an apocalypse. Sinn Féin and others in the House have committed to seeking Ireland's exit from the European Union if TTIP is not passed by a referendum. The Right2Change manifesto advocates an Irish exit from the European Union should there be no referendum on TTIP. In setting aside the scare stories, we must also accept that many groups have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. The timetable of reaching an agreement by the end of the year appears to be impossible if the promised consultations are to continue. Will the Taoiseach outline what he is being advised by the European affairs division in his Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in terms of the likelihood of TTIP reaching a conclusion? What is his perspective on the issue? While the publication online of most position papers in the negotiations is a welcome development, too much detail remains unclear. Notwithstanding the independent review of the implications for Europe as a whole, no country specific review has been undertaken. Before we vote on any agreement, I ask the Taoiseach to provide an assurance that a rigorous independent study on the implications of TTIP for Ireland will be prepared? Will he commit to commissioning such a report as it would be important in informing the debate, which has been proceeding on an ad hoc and a continuing basis for some time?  Ireland, as an open trading nation that exports most of what it produces, is in favour of trade. On the other hand, serious issues arise regarding investor legal agreements in terms of suing sovereign governments. This is an issue of genuine concern on which people need assurance. 
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I would not tolerate any situation where religion or discrimination would apply in terms of proposals from another leader or government. In this country, we have been very free and open about these matters. In regard to the TTIP arrangements, we strongly support the European Commission, as the EU negotiator, to be able to conclude an ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement with the United States.The Commission's mandate for these negotiations was settled under the Irish Presidency back in 2013. It was at the G8 summit at Lough Erne, Fermanagh, to which I was invited because we held the Presidency. The agreement came from the American side to commence negotiations immediately. The independent economic analysis - the Copenhagen economic study - commissioned by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is unambiguous in its key finding that the benefits of a successful TTIP agreement would be proportionately greater for Ireland than for the European Union as a whole. The study found that the main sectors of opportunity for Ireland are pharmaceuticals and the chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery, insurance, and dairy and processed foods and that our main defensive interests relate to the beef sector, which is of considerable importance. The 14th round of negotiations will take place in July and while many difficult and complex issues remain to be resolved, we remain optimistic that an appropriately comprehensive and ambitious agreement can be reached this year. A successful TTIP agreement would be a legally mixed agreement, in that it would cover areas of member states' competence as well as EU competence. This means that any such agreement would require the approval of the European Council, the European Parliament and each member state. For Ireland, any successful TTIP arrangement would require Oireachtas approval. I agree with Deputy Martin that it would be appropriate that independent analysis of whatever final propositions are on the table should be commissioned in the context of what might be their impact on Ireland. However, the Copenhagen study indicated that Ireland would proportionately benefit more than the European Union as a whole. The TTIP negotiations are the most open and transparent international trade negotiations that have been conducted. All EU negotiating texts are made available on the Commission's website for anybody to read and examine. Reading rooms, where the consolidated EU-US versions of the negotiating texts are available have also opened across European capitals, along with one in Brussels for MEPs. The Irish reading room is at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on Kildare Street. Unlike the European Union, the United States does not publish its negotiating texts. That is why special reading rooms have been created for parliamentarians. The US has separate protocols for accessing the documents and the European Union follows these protocols in regard to the US texts. It is the same procedure the US has in place for deliberations of its Congress. I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wrote last week, on 23 May, to the Ceann Comhairle and to the Office of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, drawing attention to the TTIP reading room at the Department in Kildare Street and inviting Oireachtas Members to visit and consult all relevant TTIP documentation by appointment if they so wish.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I welcome the news that US Vice President Joe Biden will arrive here in July. He is very proud of his Irish roots, which he traces to Mayo and to the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth. He is also very supportive and very proud of the role Irish America has played in the ongoing peace process. It is also fitting that the Taoiseach attended a 1916 commemoration event in the US. The founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood there, its fundraising efforts for rebellion in Ireland and the death and funeral of O'Donovan Rossa all made significant contributions to the Easter Rising of 1916. Tom Clarke, James Connolly and other signatories of the Proclamation also spent time in the USA. As we know, the Proclamation notes the support of our "exiled children in America", which is evidence of the important role of Irish America at that time and in our own time.There would have been no 1916 Rising but for the contribution of Irish America and, arguably, there would have been no peace process were it not for the efforts of people there. It is important that the Government recognise the contribution of, and pays tribute to, Irish America. One of the most important issues for Irish Americans is the plight of the undocumented. The Taoiseach has met many of them on his travels and I know that he is in regular contact with Mr. Ciaran Staunton from his own county. It is estimated that 500,000 people left this State in the past eight years, a mind-boggling number out of a population of less than 5 million. They did not just travel to the USA but also to Australia, Canada, Britain, elsewhere in Europe and Asia, but there are tens of thousands in the USA owing to the austerity policies. That is not new, as successive Governments have embraced emigration as a policy option.  It is believed there are 50,000 undocumented Irish in the USA illegally. Contrary to Government protestations, they did not go for the craic, as a lifestyle choice or for life experience. The majority went because they had no other option; they had no long-term employment prospects or meaningful work with proper terms and conditions. Many of them have families in the USA. They pay taxes and contribute positively to society there, but when there is a bereavement or a family event such as a christening or a wedding, they cannot return home. While they contribute significantly to the US economy and are generally recognised as model citizens, they are now part of the Skype generation. I have met them in the United States and have met their families here, not least in County Mayo. It was hoped President Obama's executive order would provide an opportunity for some of them to come out of the shadows to regularise and legalise their presence, but they continue to live idir eatarthu, between two worlds. Will the Taoiseach update us on discussions he or the Government has had with the US Government on this issue? President Obama's term concludes later this year. How hopeful is the Taoiseach that a satisfactory conclusion can be achieved before then? The programme for Government refers to an historic opportunity to radically reform the political landscape and states the Government is "proposing substantive political and constitutional reform in order to create a strong responsive political system". The fifth report of the Constitutional Convention in November 2013 dealt with the question of amending the Constitution to give citizens outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections. I attended the session which was very informative. Video-conferencing was used to hear from representatives of the diaspora in the USA, France, Canada, Germany and England and the convention also heard directly from people living in the North. It voted in favour of changing the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections. This is a big issue for people living in the USA. Is the Taoiseach committed to implementing this recommendation of the convention which is now almost three years old?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	Vice President Biden is to come to Ireland. All of the details have not yet been worked out, but he wants to carry out a number of formal engagements and trace his family roots on both sides. The opportunity to be present at the Kennedy Center with 2,500 people watching some of the outstanding performing artists of Ireland was an occasion to remember. It was very well received both by the audience and the wider American public.It is important that the Library of Congress and the other locations I visited went out of their way to present many of the newspaper reports of the 1916 Rising, which featured on the front page of The New York Times for almost 14 consecutive days at the time. Obviously, newspapers were very different then - they were all news and had very few pictures. There was much more reading on the front page than one would find in modern-day newspapers. When I met the President, the Vice President, Speaker Ryan and the 20 Congressmen who turned up to the Friends of Ireland event, including Congressman Richie Neal and Congressman Peter King, I mentioned the question of the undocumented. Clearly, the US Government is being strangled because of the polarity between the two parties on Capitol Hill. I urged them to get together, where possible, in the interests of a common objective and a common problem. I raised the issue again at the Speaker's lunch on Capitol Hill. A Bill tabled by Congressman Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives aims to give Irish citizens access to several thousand E3 visas. While this is a welcome and positive step forward, there is a great deal of work to be done in both Houses of Congress before the Bill might become law. This measure would advance our objective of securing improved legal migration channels but it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens who are currently in the US, and to whom Deputy Adams has rightly referred. The people in question will continue to be a key priority in the time ahead in our contacts with the US authorities. As Deputies will know, President Obama has taken executive action within certain limited constraints of the US Presidency but that action has been appealed. A judicial case on immigration reform has been referred to the US Supreme Court and a decision is expected early in the summer. Obviously, we do not yet know the outcome of that. If the appeal succeeds and the measure is implemented, President Obama's executive action could benefit a significant number of our citizens by lifting the threat of deportation that hangs over them. It would allow undocumented immigrants who meet the conditions of the new arrangements to work and travel more freely within the US. We are waiting to see what the outcome of this case will be. The Government as a whole and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and the Irish Embassy in Washington, in particular, will continue to pursue all of these leads actively. Deputy Adams also asked about giving the diaspora the opportunity or the right to vote in presidential elections, which is of particular interest to the Irish community abroad. At one of the functions in Washington, I met a number of people who have quite a deal of expertise in this matter and are willing to make it available to us. I have appointed Deputy Joe McHugh as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora. I have asked him specifically to pursue the question of making it become a reality that we allow Irish citizens in various categories who are living abroad to be able to vote in presidential elections with whatever conditions are appropriate. That would be one of his specific priorities as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora. It is my intention to ensure this commitment is carried through. I believe in it strongly. I hope we can bring it to a reality. The scale of the spread of Irish emigrants all over the world means that the manner in which this can be facilitated will be a central part of the discussions. If a decision were made to require people to vote at a single central location, a miner or a welder in Alaska might not be inclined to travel to Washington. We have to look at other means of allowing people to give their support that can be validated and authenticated. Given that 35 million people in America claim Irish ancestry and heritage, consideration must be given to the question of how far back we should go when deciding who has the right to vote in these circumstances. All of these matters are subjects for discussion. I assure the House that the Government is committed to this. It will be a specific priority of the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora to see that it is followed through.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Does the Taoiseach regret the forthright support he and the Government have indicated all along for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, when leaders in Europe, most notably François Hollande recently, have said that under no circumstances are they willing to sign up to the TTIP deal? It reflects the growing opposition to TTIP across Europe due to concerns that it will lead to, according to some estimates, the loss of as many as 1 million jobs and enormous damage to agriculture, small and medium enterprises, standards of food safety and quality and a whole range of issues in which standards and regulations in Europe would be decimated. I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware of the internal EU Commission briefing that came out recently in which the representatives of the Commission said the deal would involve substantial gains for US agriculture if tariffs and some non-tariff barriers were fully removed by the EU side and that in the applied scenarios, the US would be a clear winner in trade in agricultural projects in TTIP. There is a growing recognition in Europe that TTIP represents quite a mortal threat to agriculture and a whole range of areas. Can the Taoiseach explain why he is so out of sync with what people across Europe increasingly understand to be the threat represented by TTIP? Why does the Government continue to support it? Did the Taoiseach have any discussions in this regard? The Government seems to be acting as agents for US interests within Europe on TTIP rather than representing the interests of ordinary people in this country as well as workers, small and medium enterprises, the environment and farmers. Why is our position so out of sync with the understanding of the vast majority of people across Europe? We have strongly disagreed with the Taoiseach for a long time over his willingness to allow US troops to land in Shannon Airport and to allow US overflights as well as the failure to search airplanes for weapons or to verify if overflights are carrying munitions. Our disagreement with the Taoiseach on that is well known. Despite that, the Taoiseach has consistently held to the line of facilitating the US military machine at Shannon Airport. Importantly, that is also in spite of the fact that every opinion poll taken on the issue shows his position is out of sync with what the majority of people in this country think. Notwithstanding our long-standing differences on this issue, what is the Taoiseach going to do if Donald Trump is elected? I will ask him very directly. If Donald Trump is elected President of the United States, is the Taoiseach going to allow troops under his direction to continue to use Shannon Airport? Did the Taoiseach have any discussions during his meetings in the US with regard to the frightening, dangerous and extremely alarming views of Donald Trump and the possibility that he could take charge of the US military machine? Mr. Trump has talked about wiping people out across the Middle East and massively escalating US military action in that region. Whatever about our previous differences, is the Taoiseach seriously going to tell the House that if Donald Trump was President of the United States, the Taoiseach would carry on with the policy of facilitating the US military at Shannon Airport? If the Taoiseach did that, it would beggar belief because everybody recognises what a dangerous man Donald Trump is.Did the Taoiseach have discussions in his meetings in America on NATO or Irish involvement in it? Specifically, can he confirm a report I have heard - I do not know if it is true, but I want to ask the Taoiseach directly whether it is - that in the dying days of the last Government it had agreed to Irish participation in a NATO military exercise but that it was cancelled because of the imminence of the general election-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I am asking whether there were discussions on NATO and Irish involvement in it while the Taoiseach was in the United States. Is there any truth in the report that the last Government had agreed to Irish participation in NATO military exercises, which would have been another very serious breach of Irish military neutrality?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	First, I do not regret saying we strongly support the transatlantic trade agreement. It holds out the possibility and has the potential to create several million jobs on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	Losing or gaining.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	It also allows the opportunity to set down standards for world trade for the next 50 years. These are two of the most developed regions on the planet and there is no reason whatsoever these two economic blocs should not be able to put together trade agreements that would be mutually beneficial to both. Clearly, there are complications; some areas are very complex. As I said, the next chapter begins in July. The European Union has been very open about all of this and, as I said, the information is available on the websites and reading rooms have been provided. Whatever final proposal emerges will have to have the approval of the European Council, the European Parliament and each individual member state because taken into account are member state competence and European Union governance arrangements. The Deputy mentioned a number of areas that might be impacted on, including agriculture, small business and so on. Public services in this country would not be undermined by any successful TTIP arrangement. The European Union would, as it should, retain the right to make new policies in the public interest, while member state governments would remain free to manage their public services as they saw fit. Commissioner Malmström also provided unambiguous reassurance in the Trade for All strategy she produced last October that no EU trade negotiations would be allowed to lower prevailing levels of environmental, consumer or social protection. That includes many of areas to which the Deputy referred. In the case of agriculture, we have both offensive and defensive positions. Quite a number of Irish exporters are exporting to the United States. We received approval last year for the entry of Irish beef into the United States and, although it will take time to build, many outlets across the United States are now carrying Irish beef. As I said, the Copenhagen economic study indicated that the TTIP would likely see a 2% to 3% increase in Irish agricultural exports. It also identified clear sensitivities about the beef sector.  More generally, Ireland's small and medium enterprises, to which the Deputy referred, are well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the United States. With each year that passes, more and more small and medium Irish companies are exporting to the United States and employing American citizens across all states, to some extent. Relevant Ministers will remain fully engaged in this process in the time ahead. The negotiations are ongoing and I hope they can be concluded successfully. One issue within agriculture that has always been of interest is that of hormone-treated meat. The European Commission has consistently maintained its position that a EU-US trade agreement will not alter the current ban on the importation of hormone-treated meat into the European Union. This position is supported by all member states, including Ireland. We have been very clear on this and they understand it.For example, the EU adopts a very precautionary but positive principle that requires all genetically modified products to undergo a formal approval process contingent on a favourable opinion from the European Food Safety Authority. These are opportunities which lie ahead. In respect of Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on the Republican Party candidate for the US presidential election, Donald Trump-----

I confirm for Deputy Boyd Barrett that I had no discussions in respect of NATO. As he is aware, we have sent the LE Róisín to the Mediterranean where there is a NATO operation between Greece and Turkey but we are not part of that. Our arrangement for humanitarian search and rescue is on a bilateral basis with the Italian Government. I held no discussions in the United States about NATO or participating in any NATO arrangement.

Will he check with the Chief Whip as to when it will take place? It is important we have it in advance of the meetings in July or any other meetings. The entire House should be involved in the debate because it is an issue of such significance.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The Taoiseach gave a very enthusiastic response to my question when he stated he fully supported the right of the diaspora to votes in presidential elections. He had three years to do something about it, but this was not my question. My question was about citizens living outside the State, including citizens living in the other part of this island in the North. Given that the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of changing the Constitution to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, it would be useful to hear the Taoiseach's endorsement of this. The Taoiseach does not need the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to sort this out. When does the Taoiseach hope to legislate for this?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	With regard to Donald Trump, the Taoiseach cannot predict who will win the next US presidential election and I accept this, but we can stand up for basic principles and we need to annunciate basic principles. What has been articulated in the US election is worrying. It is not acceptable for democrats to speak in the way Donald Trump has about various religions and ethnic groups and about building walls. It sets an appalling example for how the free world should speak and articulate its views.Politicians must speak clearly about these matters. I asked the Taoiseach would he commission a report on the implications of TTIP for this country, that is, a country-specific report. The Taoiseach's reply was that when the final proposal emerged he would then commission an analysis, but it is important to do so now because that would inform the negotiating position. It would inform the House on any debate that might transpire on the issues on which we should be holding the line. Food is very important and beef is extremely important. Food security is a vital geopolitical issue for Europe. It is not so long ago that Peter Mandelson was in charge of the European Commission and was prepared to barter away European food security on an agreement similar to TTIP. His attitude was that Europe did not need to be involved in beef production and that South America would feed the world. It is extremely important-----

Finally, regarding the arts, the Taoiseach had a very good engagement with the artistic community, as he articulated earlier. Did he at any time during his trip to the United States reflect on the absence of a real focus on the arts in Ireland? The artistic community feels very neglected, and the Taoiseach's attendance at and the strength of the event in the US contrasts sharply with the neglect of the arts sector in Ireland for quite some time, most recently in the undermining of the arts through the allocation of ministerial portfolios.

I did not ask him to predict the outcome of the US election. I know he does not have a crystal ball; neither do any of us. The question is, given the racist, dangerous and reckless rhetoric and policies articulated by Donald Trump, if he becomes the President of the United States would we continue to facilitate US troops at Shannon Airport? Mr. Trump's policies are - words fail me as to how terrifying they are and what a dangerous person he is-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I will respond to Deputy Eamon Ryan. It is important that we have a debate in this House on TTIP. I expect the Whips to make arrangements for the business organisation committee to reflect on that and have an appropriate time for the entire House to discuss TTIP. It is very important. All of the material, as I have said, is on the relevant websites. Yes, it is my view that people living outside the State who are Irish citizens should have the right under certain circumstances to vote in presidential elections. Going back to Deputy Micheál Martin's questions, we would be concerned about any diminution of the standards that apply in Ireland in the agri sector. Deputy Martin is well aware of this. We would fight very strongly to maintain and build on those standards. We are recognised internationally as being an exceptional country for the integrity and quality of our food. Carbon footprinting for all our dairy and beef herds is on the way, and we are negotiating very strongly to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement negotiated at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21. In putting those exacting standards in place, were they to be lessened or diminished in any way other countries with lesser standards could take up that slack, and that would not be in anybody's interest. We will therefore fight to maintain those standards regarding the offensive issues that we have, as against the defensive issues in TTIP.

I do not disagree that it would be in our interests to have an independent objective reflection on the proposals made to date and what might be negotiated during the course of the year. On the Deputy's comment about the arts, we had a Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for the past five years. We must recall the state of the public finances in 2011, but we are now in a different position. Obviously, yesterday's announcement that Ireland had jumped nine places to become the seventh most competitive economy in the world speaks for itself. I note that the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.8%, down from 15% plus only a few years ago. It is, therefore, heading in the right direction. It means that, if the economy continues to be managed carefully by the Minister for Finance and the Government, in the next few years the growth generated can be of benefit to the areas mentioned. I do not accept that because we have expanded the Department with responsibility for the arts and heritage by the addition of regional and rural affairs one cannot have creativity, imagination and participation in the arts, heritage and culture throughout the country, which is what we need. I do not accept for one moment that the arts, creativity and imaginative concepts are the preserve of a few. Whether it is in north-west Donegal, south-west Kerry or south-east Wexford, people in every area of the country should be entitled to participate and avail of the imagination range of young people. That is why we need further supports through having arts officers in every local authority area. I see the concept of regional and rural affairs development as part of the expansion of the arts. For the information of Deputy Micheál Martin, there has been more funding made available in that area than for quite a number of years and we will try to hold on to as much of it as we can.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	Public procurement is governed by EU and national rules, the aim of which is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality and organisational size and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body which is infringing these rules. However, there is at EU level a recognition of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement. The new EU directives on procurement, recently transposed by the Office of Government Procurement are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts. Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include: the financial capacity criterion is now less demanding - it is generally limited to twice contract value; electronic methods of communication are now mandated in parts of the award process; use of a self-declaration of compliance with selection and exclusion criteria by suppliers to reduce red tape, as in a European single procurement document; the discretion to divide public contracts into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in the procurement documents; and provision for consortia bidding to encourage SME involvement. A number of these measures had been accelerated into policy in 2014 in advance of the transposition of the new directives by Circular 10/14 issued by the Office of Government Procurement. This was broadly welcomed by SME representative bodies at the time. The Office of Government Procurement works with the industry bodies, including ISME, IBEC, the SFA, Chambers Ireland and the CIF, as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote the engagement of SMEs in public procurement. Evidence of the work and co-operation in the area can be seen in some of the following events organised by InterTrade Ireland and supported by the Office of Government Procurement in 2015. For example, in 2015 there were 19 go-to-tender workshops attended by 276 businesses. There were two meet-the-buyer events, one in Belfast and one in Dublin, attended by over 1,300 businesses and buyers from across the public sector, North and South, which focused on the opportunities for SMEs with major public sector buyers across the island.Similar events are planned for 2016. For example, a "meet the buyer" event has been announced for 8 June in Belfast and another is scheduled for October in Dublin.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The reform of public procurement across the public service is ongoing and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business. The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning Government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.

Government procurement costs €8.5 billion per annum, or €23 million per day, and should be used as an employment creation mechanism as well as getting value for money for the taxpayer. Increasingly, it has become the preserve of bigger companies and consortiums which are coming together to tender for contracts thereby excluding local SMEs, particularly in the education sector where locally based SMEs are expected to fund schools and institutions. One of the requirements of Circular 10/14 was that buyers should publish an award notice which indicates the value of the contract awarded and the tender. In 2014, only 24% of buyers published an award notice. What percentage of buyers published award notices for 2015 and 2016 to date?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	One of my first actions when I took responsibility for this area was to meet with the people in charge of the OGP, given that it is such an important area, as the Deputy pointed out. Given the amount the State spends on procurement, the OGP is incredibly powerful. We can use this economic soft power for many good things, including getting value for money, as we are trying to do. This does not necessarily mean achieving the lowest price but getting savings for the State while improving services. We can do this in tandem with a social good, as we have done in a number of areas regarding certain types of provisions in the bids to help areas that need regeneration or employment. We can also help SMEs to get access. Circular 10/14 introduced a number of areas that would help SMEs to tender for business and win public contracts, including advertising tenders on the eTenders website. We have a new directive coming in regarding e-invoicing. We encourage SMEs to get into consortium bidding. I can get the percentage the Deputy requested, although it is not yet available for 2015.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	Could the Minister of State outline the sanctions for Government agencies that ignore Circular 10/14? In 2014, the Small Firms Association, SFA, made a submission to the Committee of Public Accounts that stated 82% of its members surveyed believed the emphasis in procurement was on price rather than on value for money. There is still a very strong perception among the SME community that price is king and that the value for money and social issues, which the Minister of State mentioned, are irrelevant. TenderScout has done a survey and an analysis of Irish public procurement, which I recommend the Minister of State peruse. It suggests only 11,000 firms in Ireland are involved in public procurement, which is only 6% of the company base in the country. This indicates how many people are not interested in it, or do not feel they are competitive enough to get involved in it, and, thus, the opportunities that exist and the challenge that faces the Government in terms of using procurement as a much better tool of business.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	Only 7% the public procurement contracts awarded goes overseas while 93% goes to Irish-based suppliers. The Deputy referred to an overemphasis on price. We use the most economically advantageous tender model. I will detail the emphasis given to price and non-price factors in some examples of competitions in 2015. In the 22 professional service contracts awarded in 2015, the ratio of price to non-price factors was 30:70. In the nine awards in 2015 for clothing competitions, the ratio was 50:50. In ICT research and advisory services in the national framework, the ratio was 40:60. In the enterprise application support services framework, the ratio was 30:70. It is not just a question of overemphasis on price. We examine other factors. The lotting allocated under Circular 10/14 has allowed for lots to be awarded by region, for example. Lots can be broken down - for example, cleaning can be divided into clinical and non-clinical cleaning. There are areas in which we are constantly trying to reform and improve how the Government procures to ensure SMEs can have as good a chance as anybody else in getting tenders.In terms of our engagement with the Small Firms Association and other interested bodies, I chair two groups that are focused on trying to help small and medium enterprises in the area of Government procurement.

I especially acknowledge the contribution of the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who conducted himself in this role and led the Department for many years. I always had an appreciation of the great contribution he made to restoring the country's fortunes and now that I find myself in the place where I am taking on the role he played, that appreciation is even greater. I will always hold to this when he uses his expertise to put questions to me about what I am doing. Moving on to Deputy David Cullinane's question, under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required to review the necessity to have the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report on the findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The most recent report made under the 2013 Act was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the then Minister on 29 June last year. In that report the Minister found that, having regard to the purposes of the relevant Acts, the overall economic conditions in the State, national competitiveness and Exchequer commitments in respect of public service pay and pensions, the measures put in place by the FEMPI Acts 2009 to 2013 continued to be needed in 2015. However, the review also noted that for 2016, out to September 2018, the Government had approved proposals which subsequently gave rise to the Lansdowne Road agreement. The FEMPI Act 2015 included a series of measures, including the gradual unwinding of the pay reduction measures as they applied to public servants in line with the Lansdowne Road agreement and the amelioration of public service pension reductions applying to retired public servants. 
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
The estimated costs of the measures which are being implemented from 1 January 2016 in respect of public service pay and pensions on a full-year basis in 2018 are €844 million and €90 million, respectively.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am required to undertake a further review of the necessity to have the FEMPI legislation and report to the Oireachtas before 30 June. That report is being prepared to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.

I thank the Minister for his response, although my question was whether he believed the Lansdowne Road agreement was, as he said publicly, the only show in town. He is right in that he has to report to the Oireachtas on extending the FEMPI legislation. I understand this, but we also have a programme for Government in which the Government has committed to the establishment of a public sector pay commission and which also refers to dealing with the issues of pay equality and pay equalisation. How and when will that happen? When will the teachers and nurses on different pay scales because they happened to enter the public sector in 2011 but who are doing exactly the same job as others be treated fairly and on the basis of equality? They deserve to know the Minister's intentions in this matter.

I also welcome the huge effort put in by the union and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton and his officials. We now have another union in the State which recognises the value and protection the Lansdowne Road agreement can offer to its members and the way it can offer a framework to enable them to progress.

If Deputy David Cullinane wants proof as to the reason the agreement is the only game in town, the most recent can be in the vote last night. The reason I have made the claim about the Lansdowne Road agreement and the broad FEMPI legislation measures is that they offer the only framework in which we can manage the need for better public services and at the same time meet the wage aspirations of those who provide these public services.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	With respect, Sinn Féin has given qualified support to the Lansdowne Road agreement. We said that if we were in government, we would implement it. It is not what we wanted and we would have done it differently, but it is the agreement now in place.As such, I do not have a difficulty with the implementation of the agreement because at long last it gives something back after years of cuts in public sector numbers and pay. My question to the Minister is on the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a public sector pay commission. When is that going to happen and how is it going to happen? The Lansdowne Road agreement did not deal with the issues of pay equalisation. The Haddington Road agreement dealt with it in some respects in that it merged some of the pay scales, but it did not deal with the issue in its entirety. I am asking the Minister a straight question. How is that issue going to be dealt with? The Minister is extending the FEMPI legislation, which is emergency legislation. Does he still believe there is an emergency? The Government talks about a recovery at every opportunity it gets, but when it comes to public sector pay, we still have an emergency and emergency legislation must be kept in place.

A crucial element of that is ensuring that we have responsible wages in place for those who work in our public services so that we can meet the wage needs that they have now and in the future. The unfunded wage increase of today is the wage cut of tomorrow. I acknowledge that we are moving into a different phase in our economy, but that means the need to manage wages, whether from the point of view of the competitiveness of our economy or the affordability of our national finances, is as strong as ever. I welcome the acknowledgement Deputy Cullinane gave to the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is very valuable that he has done so and I appreciate him noting that in our first engagement here in the House. In regard to the role of the public service wage commission, I am required under the Lansdowne Road agreement to consult with all participants in that agreement before we set up any new process for how we look at matters. We aim to begin that consultation in the coming weeks.

It is complemented by the policy principles set out in the agreement made with Fianna Fáil to facilitate the effective operation of the partnership Government. The programme contains a commitment to spend at least €6.75 billion more on public services by 2021 compared to 2016. This will allow expenditure to be increased to meet the additional costs arising from an ageing and growing population and to provide for targeted improvements in public services. In addition, the Government proposes a cumulative additional €4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021. As stated in the programme, the new Government will ensure in respect of every policy challenge that a balance is struck between addressing urgent priorities by utilising the action plan framework set out in the programme document and engaging in long-term planning and thinking so that lasting solutions with broad-based support are implemented. In order to implement this approach effectively in practice, a key action for the Government's first 100 days is to secure agreement with the Oireachtas on putting in place a reformed budget process. This is intended to secure a more participatory approach underpinned by a substantially enhanced Dáil input into and feedback on the development of budgetary priorities. It is envisaged that an important element of this new model will be to facilitate appropriate consultation and engagement on the costings of specific measures intended to respond to particular programme for Government priorities, as well as examining how these measures align with overall fiscal parameters.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 In this regard and as part of the proposed new arrangements in respect of the budget process, which I announced with the Minister for Finance last week, it is proposed that the Government will publish a mid-year expenditure report. It is envisaged that this report will set out revised end-year outturns for 2016, outlining the impact of any additional expenditure on ministerial expenditure ceilings. This new approach will have a central role to play in guiding and informing deliberation by the Oireachtas on budgetary options and in shaping the Government's budgetary proposals in due course. These proposals would then form the basis for setting out the proposed departmental expenditure ceilings required to accommodate the specific measures to deliver the programme for Government priorities.

I do not know whether it is good news or bad to note that I will not be shadowing him myself into the future. However, I wish him and his Ministers of State well. I have two simple questions for the Minister. While I appreciate the 2021 perspective in his reply, I did not ask about it. I asked two things. The first was about the costings. The Department has prepared them and there will be FOI requests in that regard. However, it is important in the new politics that we get answers in the House rather than wait for responses to FOI requests. What is the cost of the commitments entered into by the Government with Fianna Fáil and the Independents?What are the implications for this year's Revised Estimates of expenditure? What additionality is there in the 2016 Book of Estimates? Today, I read that the Government had made a number of commitments about Garda overtime and so on. Will there be adjustments in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, for 2016 and when will we be notified of their specifics?

We will introduce them later this year than would have been the norm during the Deputy's tenure in this role. I aim to secure Government approval for the Estimates soon. When that is done, the information will have to be made available to the Dáil because the Dáil must vote on them.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I thank the Minister but surely the Government did not enter into programme for Government commitments without costing them in advance. That would have been foolhardy in the extreme. What are the costs of those commitments over and above the Revised Estimates for 2016? Under the new budgetary process, we will shortly see Estimates. However, discussing the 2017 Estimates would be a vacuous process if we did not know the implications of the 2016 outturn figures. Regarding the Garda Vote specifically, what is the Minister's best shot at the additionality that will be required? I do not doubt that the Minister has asked about and has been well briefed - he has very good officials - on the expected health overrun this year. Will there be additional money for delayed discharges, the fair deal scheme, the winter initiative and the waiting list initiative? This morning on the news, I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who wanted an emergency €80 million fund for new drugs. Will that be provided as well?

He made a fair point. Alas, my answer to him is the same.

As soon as I have reviewed the Estimates that were designed to be passed at the start of this year and determined whether they remain the appropriate ceilings, we will make the figures available to the Dáil, as is required and given the fact they need to be passed. Regarding the Deputy's question on the cost of the programme for Government, it will be more than €6.7 billion over a five-year period. As to the year-by-year cost, my colleagues and I will go through the same process that the Deputy implemented well in the previous five years. We will consider the commitments on a year-by-year basis. Those that are affordable each year will be met, with their costs included in the Estimates for that year.

The process leading up to the publication of the current plan sought to ensure that resources were focused where needed in order to drive economic recovery and meet social needs. This principle was also central to the strategy detailed in the programme for a partnership Government. In specific terms, the programme has proposed, subject to Oireachtas approval, an additional €4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021. This additional spending in transport, broadband, education and flood defences will be allocated on the basis of the outcome of the mid-term review of the capital plan by mid-2017 that was announced at the time of the publication of the capital plan, the commitment to which was confirmed in the Government's programme. As always, to support traditional procurement, alternative means of funding necessary infrastructure will also continue to be explored. This is in line with many previously successful investment plans and will build on the success of such methods as public private partnerships, PPPs, and commercial State sector investments.What is important, however, is that any such off-balance sheet funding arrangement be pursued in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and that the public finances can afford. I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputy and his colleagues, in addition to those of all Members of the House, on capital investment priorities based on the opportunities provided in the reform of the budgetary process in regard to which the Government announced its proposals last week.

Given the long lead-in time for many projects, as we all know, surely it would be appropriate to bring forward a review of the plan in the context of discussions under way in another part of Leinster House on the serious need for urgency in meeting housing commitments. With regard to the commitment in the programme for Government to establish 135,000 new jobs in the regions outside Dublin and the associated investment, the jobs are to be created by 2020. This will require a massive capital investment in broadband and the road network. An extra €500 million has been promised in this regard. Surely, therefore, in the context of all the commitments made and bearing in mind that the plan is nearly out of date in the context of the commitments in the programme for Government and the promise of an extra €4 billion, it is time to review the plan.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	Let us acknowledge that the overall plan involves a total quantum of over €40 billion. Approximately €27 billion is to be made available via Exchequer investment, while the rest is to be made available through various investment plans involving the commercial semi-State bodies. The Deputy is correct that the Government is examining how this figure can be increased, but it is part of a very large investment programme in the first place. The effect of the programme, to be implemented over time, would be to bring our investment, as a percentage of national income and capital, into line with that in other European countries and the investment we need to meet the needs of a growing economy and society. On the Deputy’s point about the timing of the review of the capital plan, the review has been pencilled in to take place in 2017. However, I take on board his point about how that could be done in such a way as to result in greater confidence in future spending decisions.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	Let us not get carried away by the plan which has been described as lacking in ambition. In 2019 only half of what was spent in 2008 will have been spent. The roads budget, for instance, is purely for maintenance works. In the context of the commitments in the programme for Government and given the overall figure to which the Government has committed, would it not be appropriate and sensible – God forbid – to bring forward the review of the plan to update it in the context of the changed environment and, as the Minister said, the likely input not only from a budgetary committee but also the committee on enterprise and that dealing with the regions which is associated with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Deputy Heather Humphreys. I was going to say the committee on the environment but that does not exist anymore. Responsibility for broadband is now within the remit of two Departments. Who will be in charge? Where will the capital programme for broadband be housed?

I take on board the Deputy’s point. He has said we should not get carried away with the investment, but, at the same time, we should acknowledge its scale. The investment programme, to be implemented, will over its lifetime bring investment in national infrastructure up to and in excess of €5 billion per year, which represents a very significant increase. The Deputy made reference to the previous level of investment, in respect of which he is correct, but a consequence of that level was that many national infrastructural needs were met. The Deputy asked me whether I would consider changing the schedule of the capital review. It is due to take in place in 2017, which means that it is imminent. However, I take the Deputy’s point that we should find some way to signal to the country and the industries that will be involved in building this infrastructure what the level of additional investment will be and when it will materialise.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	It has been the consistent policy approach that funds released from State asset disposals should be used, as far as possible and when the fiscal rules allow, to support the economy and job creation, while also using some of the proceeds to reduce debt. Since the State assets disposal programme was agreed to by the Government, a number of significant announcements have been made of allocations of additional funding for capital investment to be funded from the proceeds of asset disposals. In this regard, I draw the Deputy's attention to the following. In July 2012, in its first infrastructure disposal programme, involving a total investment of €2.25 billion, the Government announced that on foot of the State assets disposal programme, it would undertake further Exchequer investment, including enabling works to support PPP projects. Almost €100 million has been made available for enabling works on roads and education PPPs. In June 2013 the Government allocated an additional €150 million for schools, energy efficiency and roads projects. In budget 2014 the Government announced that, with the €200 million already committed to the national children's hospital, some €200 million would be invested from the proceeds of the lottery licence transaction and used for a range of projects and programmes. In May 2014 the Government allocated a further €200 million. In budget 2015 the Government announced that €400 million of the proceeds to be received from the sale of BGE would be made available to support the Government's social housing programme. In 2015 the Government allocated the €335 million in proceeds from the sale of its shareholding in Aer Lingus to establish a connectivity fund. In total, the Government has allocated over €1.5 billion from the proceeds of the State assets disposal programme and the sale of the national lottery licence to support jobs and economic development across the country.

I will inform the Deputy if the position changes but I am not aware of any such plans. As to whether all the funding has been drawn down, I understand it has been drawn down in the sense that it was handed over after the financial transaction took place. Was the Deputy referring to the release of the funding to achieve the objective for which it was intended?

Funding has been available for the objectives of programmes that operated between 2012 and 2014. I will revert to the Deputy on how moneys connected with the sale of Bord Gáis Energy and Aer Lingus will be released. I understand the principles governing the establishment of the connectivity fund were agreed by the House. I will contact the Deputy on the level of funding, if any, released under the fund.

Has he read a report from the European Commission indicating that the State is falling behind in terms of capital expenditure, especially on housing, health care, child care, water services and infrastructure? What plans does the Government have to increase capital expenditure? Given that IBEC has been making a similar argument to the Commission, it seems everybody except the Government recognises the need for capital investment.

We have entered the preventative phase of deficit management. This is extraordinary progress when measured against the position we were in a number of years ago. I had hoped the Deputy would have acknowledged this progress when commenting on the need for capital investment. I have acknowledged the need to increase capital expenditure and the Government will work towards that end. However, we should take a different approach to capital expenditure. Rather than identifying how much additional money we want to spend and using this figure as a target to be achieved, we should identify what projects we want to deliver, work out their costs and complete them.

It is furthermore the case that the reform measures are to be implemented by the entire group of full-time firefighters. The agreement regarding the firefighters' pay scale is the result of discussions within the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement with unions that are fully signed up to the agreement, which remains the framework for public service pay. Any further consideration of remuneration for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, will fall to be examined within the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-18. Such arrangements will require compliance with the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement on the part of the staff interests. They will also have to comply with the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2015 and their affordability must be underpinned through delivering enhanced workplace practices and productivity.

Will the Minister confirm that the template used for the fire service was used by the Teachers' Union of Ireland in negotiations? Will he reaffirm that only trade unions that have signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement and their members will benefit if a similar template were used for other professions? Could this template, with its changes in allowances and so forth, be used in other professions, particularly for new entrants?

Will these unions continue to be threatened with the use of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation? I welcome the changes to the payment of allowances to newly recruited firefighters. Could this mechanism be used by other categories of workers in the public sector? This issue is not addressed in the Lansdowne Road agreement. Is the Minister suggesting that workers use the agreement's mechanisms to deal with these issues? I am not referring to firefighters but other categories of workers who also have legitimate issues regarding the payment of allowances. 
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	As I stated, this template was my parting gift to the Minister. It is very useful, not only for firefighters. Does the Minister agree it would be useful for getting the TUI over the line and for dealing with the Garda Síochána? Is it his intention that the provisions of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation will be applied to trade unions which are outside the Lansdowne Road agreement when the current Haddington Road arrangements come to an end?

What has occurred is that the terms and processes of the Lansdowne Road agreement have been used to deal with this matter. As I stated, we will use the processes provided for in the agreement to engage with different sectoral trade unions to do what we can in response to the issues they are raising. However, all such responses must comply with the structures, timeframe and costs set out in the Lansdowne Road agreement. To respond to Deputy Cullinane, I am not threatening or punishing any trade union.

The inflammatory language used by Deputy Cullinane-----

I hope the approach of the House will be to examine how we can resolve these issues. In light of the support the Deputy expressed for the Lansdowne Road agreement, perhaps he will also acknowledge its benefits. What I and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, have said is that we must be fair to the unions that voted in favour of the agreement by ensuring the benefits and protections it offers are confined to them.

The programme identifies a number of policy challenges and for each of these challenges a clear, unambiguous, high-level ambition is also identified. Examples of these ambitions include meeting the target of building 25,000 new homes needed every year by 2020; creating 200,000 jobs by 2020, including, as Deputy Calleary noted, 135,000 outside Dublin; reducing waiting times in the health sector; and spending at least €6.75 billion more on public services by 2021 compared with 2016. As stated in the programme, for every policy challenge, the new Government will ensure a balance is struck between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning. As outlined in the programme, economic repair must be complemented by social repair. An essential foundation for delivery of this objective is sound public finances. Consequently, the Government is committed to boosting public expenditure in a sustainable way and will introduce budgets that will involve at least a 2:1 split between investment in public spending and tax reductions. In aggregate, the programme sets out a commitment to spend at least €6.75 billion more on public services in 2021 than it is spending this year.The Government is also committed to providing a cumulative €4 billion in additional Exchequer capital investment up to 2021, over and above the amounts in the capital plan. Specific proposals for these increases will be made to the Oireachtas in due course.

Surely every Minister, now they are three weeks in office, has had a chance to establish the position. The only specifics in this document relate to housing. The document proposes year one actions and ongoing action but there is no consistency in it at all. It has all of the hallmarks of the circumstances in which it was conceived, namely, up against a deadline. Can the Minister give us a commitment that a costing document for all of the proposals, both those within this document and within the facilitation agreement Fianna Fáil has with the Government, will be published before the summer recess?
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	I too would welcome that costings document. It is quite extraordinary that we have a programme for Government that is so vague and where it is not vague, there are no costings with many of the proposals. The Minister mentioned earlier in response to Deputy Howlin that €6.5 billion of extra investment was being put aside by the Government for public services and capital expenditure. Some €3 billion of that is "standing still" money. It is to do with changing demographics and public sector pay. Therefore, in net terms, only €3.5 billion will be used to improve services. This information is in the document, which states the provisions are inclusive of public sector pay, which is the Lansdowne Road agreement, and ageing or changing demographics. Therefore, in real terms, we will only see a €3.5 billion investment. That is perhaps why many of the measures in the programme for Government, which Fianna Fáil has signed up to, are not fully costed. I would welcome the bringing forward of the costings for the proposals as soon as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	I return to my original question as it is the most germane for those of us here to hold the Government to account. We are halfway through 2016, so what are the implications for this year's Estimates, for public expenditure and for the published revenue of the commitments made in the new programme for Government? Is the Minister saying there is no additional expenditure over what was signed off by the previous Government to be borne this year? He should know, halfway through 2016, what the implications are for 2016.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	138	I have already answered Deputy Howlin's question but I am happy to repeat my answer, namely, that I will be reviewing the Estimates published for 2016 in light of where we stand now and will bring a recommendation to Government in that regard. As soon as I have Government support and agreement on the Estimates for this year, I will bring them before the Dáil. I am also conscious that given where we are in the year and the need for the Estimates to be passed, it is important we do this sooner rather than later, particularly before we move into the budget process for 2017. In regard to the costings for the overall programme, I have already provided the House with the cost of the total programme, €6.75 billion. It appears I cannot win with Sinn Féin. On one hand, it accuses me of spending too much on programmes it believes will not make any difference while on the other, it accuses me of not spending enough. It is a political choice to respond to demographics. It is what needs to be done but it requires spending taxpayers' money. There is nothing automatic about that choice; it requires the decision of Government. As the Estimates are made available on a year-by-year basis to deliver the programme for Government, I must bring them to the House. I will do that and aim to do that with the 2016 Estimates very soon.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	139	Pay issues for public servants are currently determined within the constraints set by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts of 2009 to 2015 while the industrial relations environment is managed under the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018, the Lansdowne Road agreement. The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement. This gives a framework for the next few years for the Government's proposals for ongoing public service reform as well as setting out an agreed pathway to pay restoration for public servants that is affordable to taxpayers. I believe the agreement is the best way forward to meeting the needs of our public service in terms of pay policy while also continuing to reform work practices and deliver a public service that is fit for purpose. This policy also facilities the allocation of existing staff resources by the Government to essential front-line services to enhance service delivery and support existing public servants in the delivery of those services.

Will the Minister provide a timeline in regard to those discussions and give us some indication of when he will come back with proposals? The Minister also spoke of a commitment to the gradual repeal of the FEMPI measures. Will he define what he means by "gradual"? Has the Government a timeline in mind as to how that will unwind? Retired public servants have also taken hits in regard to the various FEMPI cuts. Will the Minister engage with their associations in these discussions to the same level as with trade unions?

However, the problem I have in regard to that agreement, which we would honour, concerns pay restoration. The Minister spoke about pay restoration but it is for those on over €65,000 in terms of what was taken from them through the Haddington Road agreement.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	142	It is not. The Deputy is wrong.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	It is. I am talking about the Lansdowne Road agreement. There was a separate proposal in the Croke Park agreement, a registered agreement that is being implemented as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement. For those on over €65,000, they get full pay restoration - in terms of what was taken under the Haddington Road agreement - over 2017 and 2018 and for those on over €110,000, they get full restoration in three instalments. The Minister may not be aware of that but I am certain of my facts. There is full pay restoration in terms of what was taken from those on over €65,000 over 2017, 2018 and 2019. What about those on salaries under €65,000? They had their pay chopped in 2009 by the previous Minister. Where is the pay restoration for them?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	The previous Minister touched not a cent of anybody on under €65,000 but facts were never Sinn Féin's strong point. I have two questions. The cost of providing for the Lansdowne Road agreement for 2016 was €300 million. Has the Minister set aside any additional funding for additional public service pay restoration in 2016? In regard to pensioners, would the Minister agree that as the economy improves, pensioners should be the first to have full pension restoration?

When the commission will be set up will depend on the input I get from stakeholders and I will keep the Deputy apprised of that. I do not wish to prejudge what people may say on that. In regard to engagement with pensioners and others in regard to their agreements, I do not envisage further contact with any groups in regard to future changes in public service pay or pensions because the agreement we have is in place up to 2018. The contact I will have with groups or individuals will be about how we implement the agreement as it is currently organised.In answer to Deputy Cullinane's question, the benefit of the Lansdowne Road agreement is that it gives the strongest benefit to people on low and middle incomes. Given the way the last Government negotiated the agreement, which was led by Deputy Howlin and which focused on the cash amount made available to people on different salary tiers-----

I have already covered Deputy Howlin's question about pensions. I will not prejudge negotiations we might have in the future as to where benefits will go but we have an agreement in place until 2018. I have not set aside additional amounts on top of the sums to which the Deputy referred.

Those who undertook any lobbying since 1 September 2015 were required to register and submit returns of their lobbying activity on the online register. I am very pleased with the level of compliance achieved in these initial return periods. There are currently more than 1,300 organisations and individuals who have registered and almost 4,500 returns have been submitted to the register. The information available on the register provides the public with unprecedented insight into the role that lobbying plays in contributing to policy and funding discussions and decisions. Communications between the political systems, public service and all sectors of society will be supported and strengthened by this register, leading to better informed policy and decision making. The overall level of compliance is a very positive indicator that there is an acceptance of the need for openness and transparency in lobbying. It is clear that the work undertaken by my Department and the Standards in Public Office Commission in building awareness and understanding of the Regulation of Lobbying Act has been effective and I am confident that this momentum will be maintained as this work continues. Currently, Part 4 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which relates to enforcement provisions, has not been commenced. This was a deliberate decision made to allay any concerns that stakeholders may have had about inadvertent non-compliance with the provisions of the Act and to allow those lobbying a period of time to become familiar with their legal obligations and the registration system. Given the success of the system, and the high levels of compliance, it would be my intention to commence these provisions early next year.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, had meetings with the banks last year on variable rate mortgages. Two of the banks with which he met declared them as part of their lobbying returns but two others did not. Even at that level, there seems to be confusion over the obligations of the Act. It may also be that because no enforcement is in place, people are not afraid of it. How early in 2017 will the Minister enact the enforcement procedures and what month in this year will the review of the Act get under way?

The reason we built in a review period was to deal with the kind of issues to which the Deputy referred.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	As the Deputy may be aware, significant advances were made in this area in 2014 when a radically revised system for State board appointments was introduced with the following key principles at its core: the promotion of wider access to opportunities on State boards; the establishment of detailed and comprehensive criteria for those roles; and the introduction of transparent and rigorous assessment of candidates against these criteria. In broad terms, the objective was to open the State boards appointments process to the largest possible pool of suitable candidates from across Irish society. This constituted the most far-reaching reform of State board appointments since the establishment of the State. My Department issued guidelines in November 2014 setting out how the new appointments process is to work in practice. Since then, 336 vacancies have been advertised for 82 boards and 215 appointments have been made for the 59 campaigns completed. Some 4,990 people are currently registered on www.stateboards.ie to be notified of vacancies arising on State boards. In line with our commitments in the programme for Government, I now propose to further strengthen the process by requiring ministerial nominees for the role of chairs of boards to be assessed and have their suitability for appointment confirmed by the Public Appointments Service. In addition, nominees for chairs of State boards will, following confirmation of their suitability by the Public Appointments Service, be required to have their nomination ratified by the relevant Oireachtas committee prior to their appointment being made by the Government. My Department is also examining how the commitment to put the State board appointments process on a statutory footing will be most effectively achieved.

During the period of the last Government, only 20% of some 1,200 State board vacancies were filled through this public process. What target does he have for the new process?

The first example of the new process will happen soon in the case of the Department of Health, where competent individuals will be put into important roles as chairpersons of State organisations in a transparent manner.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	164	I want to raise the unacceptable situation regarding the approval of life-saving drugs. This has come into the public domain again in the past week, in particular in the case of three drugs, namely, Pembro, Nivo and Ibrutinib. Pembro has had an astonishing impact in the treatment of melanomas and the prospects for its impact on lung and kidney cancer are also exciting, something to which most oncologists will testify. Pembro and Nivo deal with melanomas and Ibrutinib deals with CLL, a type of blood cancer. They all have significantly improved survival rates and all are in use in most of the EU25 countries. They have been approved by the FDA and the European pharmaceutical agency, as they have by our own pharmacoeconomic unit, which is normally the area of contention when disagreements arise. It suggested, for example, that with Ibrutinib there was a 90% survival rate, which is quite dramatic, while up to 50% of those treated with Pembro can expect to have significant survival rates. There has been an unacceptable delay in approving these drugs, because the pharmacoeconomic unit approved them in February. My understanding is that the relevant group within the HSE is not due to meet until June. To be fair to the Minister for Health, he has brought forward that meeting to Wednesday. The compassionate access programme has been closed and it now only applies to existing patients.No new patient can access these vital drugs. I met a family over the weekend. Other Deputies have met families also. The prospect facing families is having to find up to €10,000 to start paying for a drug that has been approved by the pharmacoeconomics unit. What is going on is scandalous. It speaks to the lack of an overarching policy in this area. I ask the Taoiseach to take every step to ensure the approval process is sorted out as quickly as possible. My understanding is that after the approval of the HSE committee has been secured, the matter has to be referred to to the Government. I suggest we consider the establishment of a ring-fenced fund that could be top-sliced from overall Government expenditure. If 0.4% were taken from it, approximately €200 million could be put into a separate fund every year. The fund that builds up during the years could be used to deal with new technologies and new drugs. Such an approach would have a real impact from a policy perspective. Alternatively, the proposed sugar tax could be used to finance such a fund. We need to do something that differs from the current ad hoc approach, which involves pushing the can down the road and hoping the issue will not come up straightaway. That is what is going on because of the current budgeting process and lives are being lost as a result. It is just not good enough.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	Nobody wants to be put in a position of determining between life and death. This will continue to be an issue because new drugs are being tested, assessed, analysed and created as time passes. A number of new drugs come on stream every year. Deputy Micheál Martin has referred to pembrolizumab and nivolizumab. The new Minister in the Department of Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has asked for a meeting on the availability of these drugs to take place tomorrow. The State pays out €1.7 billion on drugs every year and that figure could potentially grow by approximately €400 million in the coming years. There is always an analysis that has to be carried out. I understand a price cannot be put on a life. More high-cost treatment drugs are continuously coming out. Like other countries, Ireland needs to ensure those patients who could benefit most have priority access to emerging high-cost treatments. At the same time, we must ensure the drugs are affordable to the taxpayer. It is important to emphasise that these decisions should not be made by the Government or ministerial order. They have to be made through the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics which makes clinical decisions on the basis of a determination of the value and benefit of drugs for patients who can avail of them. As the Deputy has pointed out, the drugs referred to are being considered by the HSE. I hope the participants at tomorrow's meeting will reach a conclusion on whether these drugs represent value for money. The Minister has asked the HSE to conclude its deliberations quickly because he wants to know the position. A memo has to come to the Government which will have to consider the cost implications of what is involved. No Minister wants to be put in a position in which he or she has to tell people that somebody will die if they do not approve a drug. As time passes and the years go by, there will be new treatments that will be exceptionally expensive and still have great benefits for people with particular ailments. A drug produced at the AbbVie facility in Sligo is not just a treatment for hepatitis C - it is an absolute cure. It brings joy and consolation to people who are able to avail of it and enjoy its curing qualities. It means a whole new emphasis on life and living for them. As I said, the group is meeting tomorrow and the Minister needs to know. We will wait and see what the group's analysis and conclusion is. The Minister will bring a memo to the Government as soon as possible. I take Deputy Micheál Martin's point that this issue needs to be dealt with as part of an overall strategy within the health system. Given that almost €14 billion is provided for it, it is obvious that one could identify areas where savings of a serious nature could be made. We do not want to be in a position where somebody who needs treatment with a very expensive drug has his or her life taken from them sooner than would naturally have occurred because he or she does not receive this treatment. We want to see a clinical decision by those who understand these things. After the Minister is informed of that decision, the Government will make a decision on the affordability of these drugs in order that taxpayers will know that they are getting good value for the money they are spending and patients can have their lives saved where that is appropriate.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	Any oncologist to whom I have spoken has been very clear about the efficacy of these drugs. The pharmacoeconomics unit which normally makes its determinations after weighing up cost-benefit analyses and survival rates made its decision in February. People were waiting for the HSE committee which was not due to meet until June to decide.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	169	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	170	This is not the first time this has happened. There is a significant hiatus between the decisions of the pharmacoeconomics unit and those of the group of HSE officials. In no way is it good enough. What group of officials will second-guess the formal process of evaluation that has already taken place? Greece which is more fiscally challenged than Ireland has these drugs in operation and is using them in its hospitals. We lack any sense of urgency. We need someone to cop on and get at this thing, particularly after they have been approved. We should encourage and nurture new technologies. That is what the country was about at one time. I am not saying the pharmaceutical companies are angels because they are not. They have to be challenged also. As a country, we are not playing this properly; we are just ambling along. We are delaying while people's lives are at risk. We need to value an approach which wants to encourage innovation and investment in research and development. The MSD plants in Cork and Carlow, for example, are key to the processing of these drugs. We have to fund innovation before we can have generic drugs. The bottom line is that these drugs have been passed by the pharmacoeconomics unit for use. We have an urgent obligation to get this over the line as quickly as possible, especially in the interests of the young people who are awaiting these drugs which can have a dramatic impact. This issue is going to come at us again in the coming months. As I said, pembrolizumab is going to be available to treat kidney and lung cancer. I have suggested a way to grapple with this issue for once and for all. No one in the country would object to the creation of a ring-fenced fund. I suggest €1 of every €250 spent by the country every year be put aside in a ring-fenced fund to be built up over time and used as leverage to negotiate and develop a strategy. It would be separate from the current health budget which cannot deal with this issue as it is. It is time. I do not want this issue to come up on Leaders' Questions in the next few months as the next drugs come on stream. I welcome innovation. If someone had done this in the last century in the case of penicillin, where would we be?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	Of course, the country has invested heavily in innovation and research. A certain number of new and very expensive treatments will be brought forward in the next five or ten years as a result of the work of the many research students working in pharmaceutical companies. We do not know the extent of the cost of these drugs when they are eventually tested and will come on the market. Some of them will be exceptionally expensive. As the Minister has ordered the committee to meet tomorrow, we will have a conclusion. Regardless of the outcome, I expect him to bring a memo to the Government. I am conscious of this. It would be lovely to have a ring-fenced fund for all of the different sectors, but life is really not like that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	It can be.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	The Minister will look at how effectively much of the €14 billion fund is being spent in areas of the HSE. I am quite sure a significant amount can be saved. We can all understand it would be nice to have a specific fund for exceptionally expensive drugs used to treat a smaller number of patients who really need them because of their particular ailments. I would like to think we can speed up the process of getting a decision and a conclusion in order that hope can be restored to these patients and that they can be confident the State has not forgotten about them. There is a balance to be struck in all of these things. We are paying over €1 billion on drugs every year. That figure is going to increase by a further €500 million in the coming years. While these are things that have to be taken into account in respect of the taxpayer, one cannot put a price on human life.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	I understand the British National Crime Agency has arrested two people today as part of its investigation into NAMA's Northern loan book, known as Project Eagle. For years now Sinn Féin and others have raised concerns about the sale of NAMA's loan books, including the sale and purchase process for its Northern loan book. The Taoiseach and the former Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, have accused the Opposition of conflating the matter. Deputy Joan Burton described it as just a "Northern tale". I put it to the Taoiseach that it is actually a national scandal and a disgrace. The sale and purchase process for NAMA's Northern loan book has been the subject of serious allegations. It has been alleged that, as part of a cosy cartel that was in operation, insider trading took place, that payments were made to a golden circle and that illegal fixer fees were paid. This was brought to the attention of NAMA by a potential US bidder, Pimco. NAMA previously claimed that its Northern advisory committee was not privy to confidential information on the sale, but it has since been disclosed that the committee discussed potential purchasers on at least two occasions before the loan book was sold at a huge loss to Irish taxpayers. There are investigations in the North by the National Crime Agency, NCA, the law society and revenue. There was an Assembly inquiry which found the Government's approach very unhelpful. There are also investigations in the USA by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI and other authorities. However, there is no investigation here. In this State, the Minister for Finance, the Government and NAMA have closed ranks. The chairman of NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, said he briefed the Minister in full, including on the scandal of a fixer fee of £15 million sterling, which is totally irregular and illegal. Despite this, the Minister failed to suspend the Project Eagle sale process or to inform the office of the First Minister or Deputy First Minister. The Assembly inquiry noted this failure with regret. This is a public interest matter, which must be fully investigated.

It must be fully investigated to get to the bottom of allegations of wrongdoing and cosy cartels which have cost the citizens of this State millions of euro. Does the Taoiseach not believe it is time for the Minister for Finance to make a full statement on all of these matters to the Dáil?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	The Minister has made a full statement already and there has been quite a deal of discussion at the various Oireachtas committees on the question on NAMA. NAMA personnel at the highest level have responded and given much time on different occasions to discuss these matters. If two people have been arrested, they have been arrested on suspicion of particular charges and I expect that the court system in the jurisdiction in which they were arrested will follow through on arresting them in the first instance. Obviously, it is not for me to comment on the court system of a different jurisdiction. If they have been arrested, I assume that it is for good reason in respect of activities that would be outside the law. I trust that this will see itself through that process and be judged before the courts.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	The Minister for Finance has not made a full statement to the Dáil. It is not just Sinn Féin which has these issues. Others have raised these issues consistently and in a very detailed way. It is impossible to get information from any of the Ministers on issues as serious as this one. The Taoiseach refused to establish a commission of investigation. NAMA is an arm of the State. It is dealing with the people's money. NAMA is not accountable but it should be. It should command public trust and confidence in the business of securing the best possible value for Irish taxpayers and I, for one, have no confidence that it has done this. I have seen this happen to the Taoiseach in that every so often an issue comes up but for all of his cleverness and skills as a politician, he is like a rabbit caught in headlights. This is a huge issue. There needs to be transparency, confidence and accountability. Why not depoliticise it? Why not simply open it up to those of us in the Oireachtas? The people have suffered grievously because of the kinds of activities involved in selling off what were the people's assets. Given the mounting public concern across the island, will the Taoiseach now commit to establishing a commission of investigation into the sale of Project Eagle?

I assume they have been arrested for good reason. Representatives of NAMA have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and have given very lengthy statements. They have been crystal clear that from their perspective, there is no allegation of wrongdoing against NAMA. NAMA has done nothing wrong. It has been completely in compliance with the law and the conditions it was set up under. Coming in and asking for another commission of investigation about this is not the way forward. There is no allegation of wrongdoing against NAMA and at the highest level-----

These are vital issues for low and middle income workers all over the island of Ireland. Can the Taoiseach tell us which Minister of Government is specifically charged with labour affairs and workplace issues? Will the Government legislate for the proposals in the University of Limerick report on zero-hour contracts, abuses, such as if-and-when contracts, bogus self-employment designation and, above all, protecting workers in so-called informal insolvencies and collective redundancies?

Is it the Government's intention to legislate on the University of Limerick report proposals that were being advanced by former Minister of State, Gerald Nash? The matters I have talked about are of real concern to low and middle income workers and, in fact, to all workers. The issues are zero-hours contracts, abusive if-and-when contracts, bogus self-employment and the protection of workers in insolvencies. Does the Taoiseach agree that there are now sectors of the economy which are vulnerable to exploitation, notably catering and security? Is any statutory provision envisaged by this Government to protect those vulnerable workers?

If there is an opportunity for a debate in the House, we will have that. Minister Howlin, or Deputy Howlin - gabh mo leithscéal - is well aware of the foundation he partly put in place himself. Ireland has moved up nine places to the seventh most competitive economy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	Will the Taoiseach indicate when we can expect publication of the Government's legislative programme outlining its legislative priorities? In that context, I note the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a health levy on sugar sweetened drinks. Will the Taoiseach indicate when that will be introduced? The Taoiseach said it would be good to have a ring-fenced fund but we can make that happen if we want. The Taoiseach can legislate to have a hypothecated fund or a ring-fenced fund where a certain proportion of expenditure is set aside every year. We did it before for technology and for hepatitis C, and the Taoiseach can do it for this area of new drug technologies, or he can use a sugar tax. While the methodology can be worked out, the idea of a ring-fenced fund should be put into practice. Will the Taoiseach indicate when a sugar tax will be introduced? In the Thirty-first Dáil there was a Bill on the B list to introduce legislation for assisted human reproduction. The programme for Government for the Thirty-second Dáil contains a commitment to introduce legislation on the regulation of surrogacy and assisted human reproduction services. Will the Taoiseach indicate if this Bill will be on the A list when the Government produces its legislative programme? The Minister for Health is beside the Taoiseach and he might be in a position to indicate how high up the list that is. Last week I asked the Taoiseach about the cap that seems to have been put on the supply of home care packages and home helps, even though there is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase funding for same. In addition to increased waiting times for home care packages, there is also an increase in the number of people waiting for clearance for the fair deal scheme. At the end of April 2016 there were 603 waiting four weeks, which compares to 197 at the end of September 2015, when the average waiting time was two weeks. Clearly, something has happened over the last two months, as most Deputies in the House can confirm, not least the Deputies beside me. Someone needs to review the waiting times and the cap that is being put on this area of home care packages needs to be lifted. Will the Taoiseach indicate when those items in the programme for Government will be implemented?

I expect the legislative programme will come before Cabinet next week, once Ministers and Secretaries General have settled on what it is they want to be able to put through during the forthcoming period. We have had this practice of A lists, B lists and C lists for as long as I can remember. On every occasion the Dáil has come back, Ministers were sent in to get their Bill on the A list and they found themselves with 25 or 30 Bills, none of which appeared until the second half of the Dáil programme, which resulted in all of the pressure for guillotines to be applied.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	This is a different situation. To get any Bill through now, we need consensus, agreement, consultation and so on. That is what Members are going to have, and they will have plenty of it. There is no point looking for 25 Bills on the A list when a Minister is only going to get three or four through. The committees that will be set up by the Oireachtas will have a far greater responsibility than previously. Members should not be expecting A lists and B lists. We need to know what are the priority pieces of legislation from Ministers and their Departments that are important to put through in this session, which will last until the end of July or the middle of August - just to be on the right side of the argument - before the House rises for the summer, and again for the second period when we move into preparation for the budget for 2017.

I expect that next week. Issues like the sugar tax and such like are a matter for the budget. The Minister for Health will have as many or more home care packages for this year. He is looking at the question of the waiting lists for home care packages and the timescales involved, which Deputy Martin mentioned. He is trying to get a fix on a whole new strategy for attempting to deal with the many problems in the health care sector that can be dealt with effectively and with the cost-effective use of the taxpayers' money. We would expect the legislative programme before the Cabinet next Wednesday.

Having listened to the Taoiseach waxing lyrically, I note the programme for Government in a wonderful understatement acknowledges that significant reform of the Seanad is long overdue, and states, "We will pursue the implementation of the Manning Report, as a priority". In light of the secret deal done between the Taoiseach and Teachta Martin to give Teachta Martin the right to nominate three people to the Seanad, how seriously should we take that commitment to Seanad reform? What happened to the Government's commitment to openness and transparency or, for that matter, to Fianna Fáil's commitment to new politics?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	Is this the extent of the reform of the Seanad? On 12 occasions reports have been proposed on Seanad reform and not one has been implemented. We are proposing the establishment of a committee on Seanad reform to report within weeks. Will the Government's new Seanadóirí support this proposal? On the issue of An Garda Síochána, the programme for Government commits the Government to supporting the new independent Policing Authority. Sinn Féin is very critical of the decision by the Government to only provide the Policing Authority with responsibility for nominating persons for the posts of Garda Commissioner and deputy Garda commissioner. Despite our efforts to get it to do it the way Patten did it, the Government has retained the power to make these appointments, which is unacceptable. However, my concern today is that, last Tuesday, the Cabinet appointed four of the eight vacant assistant Garda commissioner posts. Under the legislation establishing the Policing Authority, this was to be its responsibility and I understand it was to take up this responsibility in July. At this time of controversy and difficulties, why did the Cabinet completely undermine the role of the new Policing Authority in appointing these assistant Garda commissioners one month before the legislation is due to come into effect? What of the other four unfilled positions and the up to 20 senior Garda promotions we understand are to be announced shortly? Is the Government going to make these appointments also? Does the Taoiseach not accept these Cabinet decisions undermine the role and function of the Policing Authority and the commitment to it that the programme for Government contains? A constituent of mine contacted me last week to express her concern once again at the failure of the HSE to agree the availability of immunotherapy treatments for cancer patients, specifically Opdivo and Yervoy.This woman has been involved in a clinical trial since 2013. She is now in remission and her story is a good one, but other cancer patients do not receive these drugs or the new drug, Pembrolizumab, which one oncologist described as game changing. It is being hailed, along with the other immunotherapy treatments, as a replacement for chemotherapy and with significantly better outcomes for patients. It is also said to be cost-effective for the State. Delaying this decision will cost lives. Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Health to clear away whatever obstacles there may be to immunotherapy treatments and the use of these drugs?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	243	The Minister has already done that. There is a very clear process for the determination of drugs of this nature. It is done through a clinical process. The meeting is tomorrow and the Minister will be informed and will report on it. Obviously he is anxious to have an effective process expedited in the patients' interests. Decisions are made clinically and not by politicians or the Government. In respect of the second matter raised by the Deputy, last week the Government appointed four assistant commissioners. Let me be very clear about this. The Government did not change the recommendations or the order of recommendations made in respect of those nominees for positions which were vacant. The reason they were appointed was because significant areas of the country were not in the charge of any assistant commissioner and it was felt appropriate that those four appointments, which came through the process in the order in which they were nominated, be put in position to deal with the fact we had an escalating gangland situation with serious elements of crime to be dealt with and significant parts of the country were not under the direction or control of any assistant commissioner. The other appointments to be made, and the 20 or more senior appointments that must be made, will be made by the independent Policing Authority. The Government will have no function in making those appointments. This will apply from now on for all those appointments. They will be made completely by the independent Policing Authority. It was just the urgency of this situation and the fact huge areas of the country were without direction from an assistant commissioner, putting pressure on the entire system, that they were put in place. I confirm to the Deputy again there was no change in the order or the recommendations made. In respect of the Deputy's first question, I would like to see the Manning report implemented in terms of reform of the Seanad. We have had so many reports, commissions and work groups over the past 40 years looking at the Seanad. The people decided they wanted the Seanad to remain and remain it will. In my view, I would like to see the new Seanad deal with the implementation of the Manning report. Perhaps it might not be able to be implemented in all of its facets, but it is a report based on an objective, experienced analysis of people who have served in the Seanad and who have no further personal interest or stake in it other than to see how it might work effectively. In respect of the Deputy's remark about Deputy Martin, the position under the Constitution is the nominees of the Taoiseach refer specifically to the Taoiseach of the day. I could have decided not to have had anything to do with Deputy Martin in this regard, but I think nobody could object-----

This is a partnership Government. It is very different to having a majority Government, because one is not in a position to do as one might like. I did say that if he gave me a couple of nominations from particular sectors I would consider them. Can anybody object to the founder of Pieta House being able to give of that experience? Can anybody object to the chief executive of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland or a business person adding to the range of what is in the Seanad? This is the reason. These are important facets of understanding that we are in a very different political position to where we were before, and attitudinal change is very important. I like to think the appointments made will work in the broader interests of many issues. We will debate mental health this evening, which is of such importance. So many people are behind closed doors where the public might never know about it with tragic consequences in some cases.

I bring the Taoiseach's attention to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016. It was the last Act passed by the House on 11 February. It is now 110 days later. In three and a half months we have not passed a single Bill. I cannot recall in my time here a period of time elapsing like this. The Taoiseach has indicated a list of Bills, some of which I have in front of me, which are ready to roll. Some of them have passed Second Stage and others are in the middle of Second Stage. The Taoiseach mentioned the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, and legislation dealing with paternity leave and with standards in public office, in which I was involved. All of these Bills are ready. Why are we not dealing with legislation this week? We need to have a real legislative programme to get our teeth into and I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that we have this. I am amazed we do not have it for this week, but certainly we should have a comprehensive legislative programme for next week. On a similar issue, we are halfway through the year and we have not passed any departmental Estimate. It cannot be that more than half of the allocated resource to a Department is extended without the authorisation of the House. It is constitutionally fraught to allow this. When will the Revised Book of Estimates be published so we can refer the Revised Estimates to committees and give them legal authority? The Taoiseach will share with me the following deep concern. This morning, I heard that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is finding life at Cabinet very difficult. Is there anything we can do at this time of trauma for him to ease the burdens which are obviously placed upon him?

The Minister is working very hard on this, and instead of waiting for it to come through by the end of the year we hope that with a bit of agreement it might be possible to put it through before the House rises for the summer.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	This morning, The Irish Times reported a briefing note prepared for the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, suggests the qualifying age for disability allowance be raised from 16 years to 18 years. It states the reason for doing so is that young people with disabilities might be considered as a cohort in the broad definition of jobseekers. Last Saturday, the same newspaper reported on a briefing paper sent to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, suggesting linking disability payments to an applicant's ability to work.The Taoiseach is well aware that the Government has indicated a plan in the programme for Government to introduce a fit-for-work labour activation scheme aimed at people with disabilities and people who have suffered serious illnesses. Despite the denial of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in the House last week that this is in any way similar to the British Tory Government's work capability assessment - a scheme which is now being investigated by the United Nations on human rights grounds after more than 2,000 people died within six weeks of being declared fit for work - it smells very much like it. It is clear that a package of measures concerning these issues is coming down the track. Can the Taoiseach give the House an indication as to when that might be? When will we see legislation on these issues?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	One gets many briefing notes in Departments, as Deputy Barry is aware. No memo has come to Government from the Minister for Social Protection in that regard. We launched the comprehensive strategy for work for people with disabilities some time ago. People with disabilities are as entitled to jobs as anybody else. We would like to see them happy in their work and that the work in which they are engaged pays. This has nothing to do with the other scheme to which the Deputy refers. In that sense, briefing notes are one thing but decisions by Government are another. We want to incentivise and encourage as many people as possible to engage in work that pays and in which they are happy, irrespective of their category.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	I am sure the Taoiseach would join me in welcoming the first meeting of the Select Committee on Arrangements for Budgetary Scrutiny tomorrow. I understand that the budgetary process in June is a critical period where some of the initial Estimates from Departments are formulated and talks between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments take place. I also understand we should have a different budgetary process this year so that we do not wait until budget 2018 to implement any change. If the Taoiseach agrees with that, can he outline when the sectoral committees will be established and whether they will be able to take part in a revised budgetary process so that each Department and every Member of this House have the chance through their sectoral committees to engage in the process? I understand we need to do this to the required timeline, which is in the next two weeks. Will that be possible? Do we have the resources and the ability to set up the committees that quickly? Is it part of the Government's vision of how this budget scrutiny process should operate that it should start this year, rather than just being an academic exercise which waits for 2018 before we do our business differently?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	Yes, it will start this year, and the summer statement, to be issued after the Estimates for 2016 have been concluded, is the start of that process. I understand that the sectoral committees should be in operation by the week after next. This, in the run-in to the summer period before the House rises and in preparation for the budget, is the start of that process. There will be the plenary discussion, the national consultative engagement and the opportunity for the sectoral committees to engage. The plenary session in this House will give its views on the different Estimates. The process is therefore already under way.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	When will we know whether we will have a Minister for the environment? Does the Taoiseach agree that while a Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is certainly appropriate, having no Minister with the title "environment" in Government, given the age in which we live, is a mistake in the programme for Government? Equally, culture has disappeared, the arts are downgraded and science has vanished from the title of any office holder in Government. When are we likely to know what the working titles of the different Departments will be? There are two Bills of which I did not hear mention in the list outlined by the Taoiseach but which are very important to people. Regarding the schools admissions Bill, many people, particularly in urban areas, do not want their children's access to school to be entirely determined by their religious profession. What does the Taoiseach propose to do? That Bill was left ready by the previous Minister for Education and Skills.

It is on the list, at No. 13 today, to be restored to the Order Paper. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is at a meeting of Ministers for culture in Brussels today.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	273	The main issue during the run-in to the election was about housing, planning and local government. The priorities were housing and homelessness. It was therefore practical to transform the previous Department into the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. Out of that former Department came the question of the environment, central to which is climate change, an area that has now been moved to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. If people want to add the word "environment" to the title, that is fine by me. Deputy Burton is well aware that action is much more important than names or words. I have listened to this business of the arts being downgraded for the last three weeks now. The arts are not being downgraded. In fact, more money was put into that sector and that Department over the last 18 months than for very many years. We want to maintain the importance of the sector. Titles are one thing but action and effectiveness are something else. Regardless of whether we restore a name or continue with the word "Environment" in the name of a Department, the central feature is climate change, which is much more important in the context of what we are trying to do in Europe and at home, with all the consequences that follow.

Page 57 of the programme refers to the extension of the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, which follows on from the question asked by Deputy Shortall. We have prepared a Bill but it has been ruled out of order because it contravenes Standing Order 179. We would be very happy, and the 10,000 children who are relying on the quick passage of this legislation would be only too delighted, if the Taoiseach would join us in supporting this Bill.

#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	I begin by congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, on her elevation to the new position of Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people. It is an area that the Minister of State has a huge commitment to and a passion for, and I look forward to working with her to help in our necessary improvement of mental health service provision. Mental health issues affect all categories of citizen - male and female, young and old, urban or rural. There are no exceptions. However, today I want to focus on young people, specifically those living in County Kildare. Kildare has one of the largest populations of young people in the country and the majority of correspondence that I have received from constituents whom I have engaged with on this issue has come from younger members of the community who feel passionately about this issue and who either have been affected themselves or had close family members or friends affected by mental health issues. I believe much of the increased media coverage and discussion about mental health in recent years has been driven by young people who have suffered themselves or know friends or family members who have, and who, therefore, want to speak out about it. For too long mental health issues were not discussed or acknowledged in Ireland even though they have always existed. Bringing the discussion out in the open is one of the first key steps in helping to address these critical issues. There are 77,832 persons between the ages of zero and 24 years in County Kildare, accounting for more than one third of the population. As I mentioned, this is one of the highest rates in the country and is also considerably higher than the eastern and midlands average. Research carried out by the Children and Young People's Services Committee found that current service levels in Kildare are not sufficient to meet the needs of the 77,832 young people in the county. However, Kildare has also one of the lowest funded youth services in the country, including those for mental health issues. That same report also highlighted that funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in Kildare in 2011 was €13.55 per young person. This was the third lowest per capita allocation in the State. Kildare also has one of the lowest funded mental health services per head of population, and this is just not good enough. We have the Lakeview mental health facility in Naas, which is over 25 years old. It is a 29 bed unit that is in real need of significant capital investment. Lakeview, I understand, is constantly at in excess of 100% occupancy. We also have ten beds in Portlaiose taking an overflow of Kildare patients and in addition, in more recent times, we have had to go and use services in Tallaght as well. This has a significant knock-on impact on support services. We also do not have enough high support hostel places as step-down facilities from Lakeview, meaning patients struggle to transition from the service following their time at Lakeview. I understand that a proposed investment plan has been submitted for consideration to the Department of Health and I would expect a decision to be taken on this as soon as possible to boost existing services in the county. This investment will be our attempt in Kildare to catch up with the rest of the country. Sometimes I feel that we in Kildare suffer from a presumption of wealth and our close proximity to Dublin. When it comes to mental health services, I believe that perception has damaged us in terms of investment. That must change. I was surprised to see in the statistics provided by Mental Health Reform that 75% of mental health difficulties arise before the age of 25. That statistic is frightening, but backs up the need for services for our young people. Credit is due to the many organisations providing services, in Kildare and nationally. From the great Samaritans to Pieta House, we have wonderful voluntary elements that are playing their part in providing the support needed to people when they reach out. We also have pilot programmes that need to be extended. Mojo is one such programme in Kildare town. This is a pilot project for men over 18 funded by the National Office of Suicide Prevention, NOSP, which has been very successful to date. While there is a commitment to continue the programme in 2017, the funding available through NOSP is limited and its future cannot be guaranteed. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that Mojo and programmes like it which are serving a real need in the community are continued through the allocation of increased funding. The child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Kildare is simply not fit for purpose.I have dealt with too many cases in which the need was not met by the service required. While changes are afoot to move services into the primary care centre in Kildare town, there seems to be an issue regarding funding from the primary care element. I will take it up with officials in the Department of Health to address the deficiency. While we have a very fine building that can help to improve the CAMHS facilities, they have not moved yet. We need it to happen very quickly. I have dealt with cases of children as young as 11 years expressing suicidal ideation and needing to go to Pieta House, given that the services in the CAMHS in Kildare could not assist them. It is not good enough. While funding for mental health services was increased by 16% under the previous Government, more is required after decades of neglect. We need to get mental health funding up to 12% of the health budget in order to be in line with our international colleagues. There is much more that I would like to say about the status of A Vision for Change. Mental health is a major issue which permeates many facets of society. We must improve how we deliver mental health services. If we do, it will go a long way toward dealing with many other issues. Continued investment in services is critical and I will use my voice to fight for it as long as I remain a Member of the House and beyond.
#HildegardeNaughton	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-party	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-dob	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	313	Mental health and an awareness of it should be included in the national curriculum for schools. The Young People's Mental Health Advisory Group which is part of the National Health Service, NHS, clinical research network recently recommended this in the United Kingdom. We should do the same here. The rationale is that prevention is better than cure and that if problems present in later years, they can be dealt with more effectively. Others have mentioned the stigma attached to mental health as a first obstacle. What better way to tackle this than in early education about mental health while young people are still learning? The NHS indicates that to have maximum access to young people, it is best done through schools. School is also where many young people start to experience mental health problems first. We have had some advances in educating young people about their mental health. MindOut and the Jigsaw mental health project are services that have been very successful. Youth Work Ireland has been offering an excellent service for young people with mental health difficulties across the country. They take up the slack in the State system and prevent even more people from joining waiting lists. However, a more sustained and school based approach is warranted. A host of international, peer-reviewed literature on the subject suggests a multi-level, school based intervention on adolescents' emotional well being is effective. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service also produced a very good spotlight document on promoting mental health in schools. It suggests mental health, rather than being seen as a problem, should be seen as something which requires maintenance and protection. I could not agree more. It is not a problem to be solved but part of who we are, like a limb or an organ. Some mental health difficulties are lifelong. While there may be no cure, in the majority of cases there are ways to enable people to live their lives. It is ongoing and we should not think it is in any way a problem. Our discussions should be about ways to enable people who suffer from mental health difficulties to lead the most fulfilling lives possible. We should be concentrating on promoting physical fitness, exercise and a balanced diet, on developing our mental health awareness and knowledge and on ongoing support and treatment, where necessary. I will make a point which I picked up from a recent social media post and talking to people. Some people, when they hear that a friend or acquaintance is taking anti-depressants to treat depression or anxiety, have a tendency to be critical of the use of anti-depressants. The point was made that some people benefited enormously by taking them. I recently spoke to a person who was infuriated by the suggestion the use of medication was something to be criticised. While the person would prefer not to be taking it, it enables them to avail of non-medical treatments. Medication is often taken as part of an holistic treatment for anxiety or depression which may involve exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy. There is no golden rule. People's mental health issues are complex and multifaceted and require knowledge and understanding. That brings me back to my original point. Where better to impart that knowledge and understanding than in school? The research indicates that mental health promotion programmes are effective in equipping people with the necessary skills to avoid or deal with mental health difficulties. There are great benefits to be had from school-based programmes. They include positive effects on behaviour, social and emotional skills, the ability to learn and achieve academically and increased levels of problem solving in social settings. The World Health Organization estimates that 20% of children and adolescents worldwide experience mental health problems. The OECD reports that 4.5% of Europe's population suffer from depression, with an associated cost of more than €118 billion. In Ireland the cost of poor mental health was estimated to be 2% of GDP, or €2 billion, two years before the economic crisis struck in 2008. Major costs are associated with poor mental health. While there would be a cost involved in placing mental health in the education system curriculum, it is very much warranted, both practically and financially. It would be the right thing to do.

#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	I extend warm congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and wish her all the best in her new role. She will be a good Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services and older people.  It is ten years since A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, established by the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and disability services, former Deputy Tim O'Malley. The foreword states, "Each citizen should have access to local, specialised and comprehensive mental health service provision that is of the highest standard". This should be our objective as we set about trying to secure resources for mental health services. Let us consider the cost of mental health problems to society. Mental illness causes both social and financial damage. The Mental Health Commission estimates that the cost of dealing with poor mental health is 2% of GNP. The mental health of the population of Ireland is an essential foundation for economic and social recovery. More than 450,000 people in Ireland experience depression at any one time. This represents one in ten of the population. People with a mental health disability are nine times more likely to be outside the labour force. Spending on the delivery of mental health supports is scandalously low. According to the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, annual expenditure on mental health services is 6.2%, which is extremely low when compared to the figure in countries such as the United Kingdom where it is 12% and Canada and New Zealand where it is 11%. A Vision for Change proposed annual expenditure of 8.24%. The low level of expenditure on mental health services must be addressed and we must start the process in the next budget. The number of suicides in Ireland has remained high, with between 495 and 554 deaths per year from 2009 to 2012. When a focused set of policies, backed by adequate resources and supported by Government policies and State organisations, was put in place to deal with road deaths, we reduced the significant number of road deaths that used to occur on the road network. We must give mental health the priority it deserves to enable us to deal with the number of suicides in Ireland. In its 2016 budget submission the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland put forward a number of positive proposals to assist in developing a policy platform for mental health services. One proposal concerned the provision of community based mental health teams for patients of all ages on a 24/7 basis nationally. It stated this must be a priority if inroads were to be made in dealing with the continued morbidity and mortality due to suicide, self-harm, chronic mental illness and alcohol and substance abuse. It also proposed a nationwide recruitment of recommended professionals to fully resource the teams, giving people in need co-ordinated, professional support where and when they needed it. A Vision for Change delineates the types and numbers of mental health professionals who should be involved in mental health teams in each area nationally. The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland also proposed multi-annual funding, beginning with a five-year rolling incremental budget, increasing to a minimum 12% of GDP. I acknowledge the work of many advocates in this area and give special mention to Dr. John Hillery, director of communications and public education at the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, who is passionate about advocating for people with mental health challenges. In my constituency, Kildare North, I see the benefits of having a day care psychiatric service in Kilcock. Users of this service contacted me recently when it was threatened by cutbacks. I was delighted that it was maintained, but I saw the distress and anxiety caused by the threatened cutbacks to the people using the service and the benefits they derived from it.

It is a privilege to be given the opportunity to contribute on behalf of my constituents, with a view to highlighting areas where there are significant opportunities for improvement. I extend my good wishes to the new Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Helen McEntee, and wish her well in her post. I also extend my good wishes to the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. Mental health is the most critical health issue facing young people in Ireland. Up to one in four students experiences psychological problems at any given time.For some the cause may be a psychiatric illness while for others it is bullying, a problem at home or difficulties coming to terms with their body image or sexual orientation. We are not doing nearly enough to help our young people to cope with such problems as is evidenced by the fact that Ireland's youth suicide rate is now the fourth highest in Europe.  As part of the agreement to support a minority Government, Fianna Fáil made it a critical point that the strategy, A Vision for Change, would be implemented fully and the party expects that to happen. Fianna Fáil's recommendations are based on the core principles of early intervention, stigma reduction, peer support, accessible community-based care and giving young people a voice in politics that affect them. I agree with the WHO's statement that mental health is an issue which even the poorest society must afford to promote, to protect and to invest in.  Every young person goes through tough times. It is estimated that at any one time one in five of them is experiencing psychological difficulties. Some Irish studies suggest that the number in this country may be as high as one in four, which equates to six or seven students in an average school class. Organisations such as Amnesty International, See Change, GROW, Alive2Thrive and STOP thrive in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and have done excellent work in reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. However, serious stigma remains and it presents a significant barrier to improving mental health. Studies have found that six in ten Irish adults would not want people to know if they were experiencing mental health problems. We must challenge this stigma and normalise the discussion of mental health issues for our young people. They must know that they are not alone in experiencing mental health difficulties. We must ensure that young people with mental health disorders to not face discrimination. Despite the high prevalence of mental health problems among Irish young people, we are optimistic that the situation can be improved if the Government acts decisively. In 1990, Australia's suicide rates were near what they are in Ireland today. However, following significant investment by the Australian Government in mental health reform, coupled with an increase in public awareness about mental health problems and the importance of getting help early, Australia saw a 55% reduction in its suicide rates in less than ten years. I would like to know how much funding will be invested in mental service services in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan. I call on the Minister to place mental health on an equal footing with physical health. We must implement A Vision for Change, that is, to give a commitment, collectively, that we will not allow another year, five years or ten years to pass without this commonly agreed strategy being implemented and properly resourced.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the important issue of mental health services. For far too long mental health services have suffered because of the outgoing Government's failure to allocate the resources necessary to ensure a functioning health service. Despite promising to protect funding for mental health services, Fine Gael and the Labour Party delayed funding allocations and instead diverted money to other areas when crises emerged. It is claimed in the HSE 2016 service plan that €35 million has been set aside for mental health services. However, that plan fails to outline where and when the money would be spent and it merely contains vague references to further specific initiatives.  Mental health issues are bordering on a national emergency. It is disgraceful that voluntary organisations and charities are funding essential services which should be provided by the State. We need to properly fund our mental health services and to stop this practice of raiding the budget every time there is a shortfall in other areas. Mental health services need to be acknowledged as being one of the most important sections of the health care service. We need to start prioritising mental health and this new Government cannot continue to ignore the significant challenges that need to be addressed in the mental health sector. It must begin by securing a workable budget that is properly ring-fenced to ensure that the services are enhanced and improved. As a priority, we need to engage in and fully appreciate the role that the arts have to play in this important issue. The arts initiative in mental health, which is already happening in some parts of the country, has the potential to embrace a range of arts practices occurring in primary health care settings, which bring together the skills and priorities of both health and arts professionals. This approach will promote health and wellbeing by improving the quality of and cultural access to health care settings. The arts initiative in mental health can involve all art forms and can incorporate a variety of approaches. By engaging the arts with mental health services, we can facilitate mental health service users to participate fully in the cultural life of their community. We can challenge the stigma faced by service users and we can enhance the health care work environment and promote the value of the arts within the health care service.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	There is a very broad consensus in this House and across the State that mental health is a very serious issue that requires immediate attention. It is our job to take that consensus and build a coherent and focused plan to ensure that the changes which need to happen are identified and tackled in the coming months. Mental health is an issue which affects nearly every family and people in every walk of life. It is particularly important that we discuss this issue now as no doubt budget preparations are already under way. Money is not a silver bullet that will solve all the problems in this area but it is clear that our mental health services and our mental health care professionals have been chronically underfunded for decades. The clearest evidence of this is that ten years on from the publication of A Vision for Change many of its recommendations are either completely unfulfilled or partially complete. Lip service has been paid to the delivery of true community-based care and institutions were closed or downsized but the replacement services have not met demand. The Mental Health Reform group, made up of large number of bodies actively involved in care provision, advocacy and health promotion, estimates that a yearly budget of €973 million is required to properly deliver the services and care needed to meet the demand being placed on the system. That is nearly €150 million more than what has been pledged for 2016 even before we consider the shameful proposal to reallocate €12 million earmarked for mental health for other purposes.  The list of crucial items yet to be delivered due to a lack of funding goes on and on. Staffing levels are 23% less than recommended. Only 2.8% of the recommended posts in mental health and intellectual disability adult services have been created. We do not have a 24-hour crisis support service in place, which leaves people in serious distress outside office hours with little access to care. In some cases people in crisis may have to travel hundreds of kilometres back and forth to different services in order to potentially get a bed in an acute unit. This is what is required of somebody who is already incredibly vulnerable and in such a hopeless state.  Accident and emergency departments, which are already packed to capacity with general medical emergencies, are having to deal with people in mental health crisis who have nowhere else to go. Many of these, after waiting for an extended period of time, have been told there is no place for them and to leave the accident and emergency department. Recently we have seen a spate of tragedies where people who left accident an emergency department in crisis subsequently took their lives. On the north side of Dublin two brothers in the space of weeks reported to an accident and emergency department with no resolution, and left vulnerable and in crisis. One brother took his life and the other brother was found having attempted to hang himself. The Minister has said that those who leave an accident and emergency department due to waiting times are gambling with their health but it is the State that is gambling with the lives of people who may be suicidal and are being forced to wait in this manner, in crowded, noisy and chaotic waiting rooms.  The full roll-out of suicide crisis assessment nurses would cost less than €400,000 but it has yet to be completed. These nurses need to be on hand to ensure no person in crisis leaves hospital without assessment and the appropriate care. We also need a focused response to the very common problem of what is called dual diagnosis, where someone with a mental health problem also has a substance abuse problem. Many people in desperate situations turn to substance abuse and our services must be able to address this without passing people from pillar to post looking for appropriate care. I wish to praise the excellent work of voluntary and community bodies such as Finglas Suicide Network, Pieta House, the Mental Health Reform group and many others who have done so much to raise these issues and to provide crucial on the ground services. Initiatives such as the recent Walk of Hope in Tolka Valley in Finglas, organised by local people, is one of many. It was a magnificent initiative to raise awareness of mental health problems. It is the responsibility of the State and we must live up to that challenge. We cannot shirk responsibility by relying on the dedication of members of the public who pledge their time so generously. We also need to treat our nurses and junior doctors better. They are not volunteers but are professionals who deserve fair remuneration and decent conditions. We can provide a service which truly delivers care where it is needed but we need to recognise that this costs money and needs real dedication. If we are willing to prioritise mental health care, we will succeed. That is a political choice. Past Governments chose to ignore the issue and that cannot be allowed to happen again.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom gach rath a ghuí ar an Aire Stáit nua, an Teachta Helen McEntee. Is mór an onóir di é a bheith ina hAire agus tá a fhios agam go mbeadh a hathair iontach bródúil aisti inniu. I have three issues to raise with the Minister of State. My colleague, Deputy Ellis, has spoken very well about the macro issue in Ireland and I want to look specifically at some of the localised, micro issues with regard to mental health. I am the chair of the campaign to save Navan Hospital which held a meeting last Thursday night to discuss the closure of the 24-7 psychiatric unit in Navan. There is deep unease within the campaign about the closure of that unit. We understand there will be clinical and accommodation benefits and advantages to the new Drogheda unit but there is significant concern that there is not enough capacity within the region. One of the major difficulties is that despite having one of the highest levels of mental illness in Europe, Ireland has fewer adult psychiatric beds than most other European countries. There has been a sharp drop in the number of those beds in the five years of the Fine Gael Government. The closure of Navan and the move to Drogheda will only reduce the number of beds available in our region. We are also concerned that it will be difficult for people who live in places like Oldcastle, Kells, Athboy and Trim to get to Drogheda. Indeed, family and friends are very important to the support of persons receiving treatment but they will not be there because the public transport links to Drogheda are simply not good enough. On top of this, there are concerns that the Drogheda building to house the new unit has not been signed off as of yet and that the pathway for patients has not been properly created. Patients admitted to Navan's accident and emergency unit are an example. We have just heard the difficulties patients have had when admitted to accident and emergency of not getting to see the specialists with psychiatric experience that they need. Due to health cuts, Meath has 33% less money for mental health services and this is going to be something which is very important for the Minister of State over the next five years. For every individual in County Meath, there is €104 spending on mental health services. That compares to a State average of €150 per person. This is not unique. Across a whole range of socio-economic areas, Meath is at the bottom of the funding list. That is because we have had a massive growth in population in the 1990s and the last decade. There are 80,000 new people living in the county but there has not been a major increase in funding to deal with that. That underfunding has a real human impact. I can give one example. There is a growing number of patients with schizophrenia in Meath who are being prescribed a drug called Clozaril to ameliorate their symptoms. This drug is usually prescribed at the end of a person's treatment - in other words, when all the other drugs and treatments have failed. It is a very strong, dangerous drug but in most cases, it allows patients to be able to live full and normal lives. However, the danger of the drug means there is a necessity for a specialised nurse to administer it. Due to cuts by the Minister of State's Government and the lack of funding in County Meath, there is no second nurse. The only nurse who is there is at complete capacity. When I put the question to the HSE as to why it would not fund another person, it said it did not have the funding to do so. It cannot be clearer than that. This is a fool's errand. Patients who do not get the service in County Meath face extreme difficulties on a humanitarian level, as do their families, but some are then forced to spend their time in the 24-7 psychiatric units the Government is closing. There are three or four more patients being prescribed the drug every month. The cost of the patient receiving the drug and living a full life compared to the cost of keeping a patient in a 24-7 psychiatric unit is not comparable. It is a fool's errand. The lack of funding for a second specialised nurse is actually costing the Government more. I hope that in the next five years, the Minister of State will pay attention to that underfunding element we have in County Meath and ensure very quickly that we have a specialised nurse available in the county to administer this drug. I also hope she will stop the closure of the 24-hour psychiatric unit in Navan.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	I congratulate Deputy Helen McEntee on her appointment as a Minister of State to tackle a very important subject and an issue which has not really received the required political attention over the last number of decades. It is important to note that we now have a dedicated ministerial appointee with responsibility for this portfolio.  I will start by addressing an issue which in certain circles remains a taboo and something which is not discussed openly. That is regrettable. If we are overweight, we exercise and if we need to improve our knowledge, we study. However, when it comes to the most important muscle in our body, we do not exercise it. We do not speak about it and we are not really given the opportunity to be heard and yet that can often be the antidote to depression. It can help even those who might not like to classify themselves as depressed but might say they are feeling low. This relates to one in four of us statistically but everyone in certain professions finds this is a subject that arises from time to time. It is important for us to recognise the importance of being able to talk and be heard and to ensure that the State provides a service which can cater to all of those in need of support, whether through resources and physical buildings or the personnel to support the general public. I am glad to see that there is a focus on mental health services in the programme for Government. I remember debating this in the Chamber and I was in the Chair at one time listening to various Members discussing mental health prior to the formation of the programme for Government. It is important to see that focus on the subject in the programme and its result in the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the area. I am pleased to see this approach being taken in the programme for Government, particularly with the acknowledgement that the budget for mental health will be increased on an annual basis. We must work tirelessly to progress and implement A Vision for Change, which is ten years old this year. I am sure the Minister of State will do just that. Education allows people to disassociate mental health issues or depression from the taboo status it has had in society heretofore. As such, the introduction of a junior certificate subject in this area is very important. Education is the key to a vast majority of issues across Irish society. If we can provide school children with the opportunity to articulate issues in what is a very pressurised environment for them in terms of bullying and physical concerns about appearance and so on, that will be positive. It is important to provide a broad base for our schoolchildren to come through the education system with the tools necessary to tackle issues that might arise with their own mental health as they grow older. We always come under pressure. The last ten years or so have been incredibly problematic for families the length and breadth of this country, whether as a result of unemployment, mortgage distress or other issues like that.Not a day goes by on which my office does not speak with individuals who, despite so many years having passed, are still under severe pressure, be it from small personal debts, issues relating to their family homes or so on. The stress that this can cause for families can shove a wedge between couples and mortgage holders, resulting in the collapse of marriages and partnerships. Several Departments can provide support, but the most important is the Department of Health, which is tasked with an added emphasis on providing mental health services. The new junior certificate subject will be accompanied by the establishment of a national youth task force on mental health, which will target how best to promote awareness among young people across the board. As outlined in the programme for Government, we will conduct an evidence-based expert review of the status of Ireland's implementation of international best practice in terms of mental health. We are a small country of just over 4 million people and, while we have proven for many decades to be world leaders in innovation at Government level, we must learn and be informed by international best practice. The best way to improve our health services, particularly mental health services, in this way is for our Minister, Ministers or Oireachtas committees to investigate and speak with representatives of various nations at health service or parliamentary level. It is a positive that we are utilising this option and conducting an evidence-based review. We must increase awareness of mental health in every community so that we might promote a discussion and remove the stigma that, unfortunately, continues to apply in Irish society to mental health issues. I apologise for having missed the previous Deputy's contribution on the provision of acute services, but the development of the national forensic mental hospital in Portrane is a positive step. It provides a 21st-century state-of-the-art facility almost in the heart of Dublin that caters for those who require 24-hour care, outpatient services etc. While the facility on the south side of Dublin is good, it is bursting at the seams and does not provide all of the requisite services. Centralising services will be important, although some issues arise in the constituency, as is always the case with such developments. The HSE's broad approach in its delivery of this facility is to be welcomed. The mental health budget has increased year on year from €711 million in 2012 to €826.6 million in 2016. While this includes a lay-over from last year, there were reasons to do with the recruitment process for that €35 million being held back. The new Dáil arithmetic means that we must all work together if we are to do anything. The recruitment process to put experts where they are required must be prioritised, which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will do in the coming months. The development of the national forensic mental hospital in Portrane is important in the move towards a patient-centred approach. I am sure that every Deputy knows someone who has faced mental health difficulties. We have all heard from constituents who have been impacted by such difficulties. It is important on this subject that the Dáil arrives at suggestions. I presume that this matter will go before the Oireachtas health committee, once it has been formed, for the purpose of debate and informing it of examples from which we can extract and implement best practice. It is up to us all to make a positive contribution to what is an important subject.

Like other Deputies, I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, every success in her portfolio. She will leave no stone unturned in dealing with this issue. She will have the co-operation of all Members in tackling what is a problem for society. Every Deputy knows the situation and has seen the stress, heartbreak and puzzlement of children, aunts, uncles, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters as they try to grapple with their families' tragedies. We have heard all of the statistics, for example, the 11,000 people presenting at accident and emergency departments last year after self-harming, and about budget cutbacks, but I will not dwell on the latter. I want to move forward and try to rectify funding cuts or improve the service so that no one is left without help. Too often, people in my locality present at a hospital but cannot be looked after. This is not the staff's fault. Rather, it is because there is no money to provide the service. This aspect of community services is important. I wish to refer to my constituency. The Minister of State will know a bit about it. Jigsaw, the mental health counselling service for young people, closed in County Roscommon last February because it could not recruit a clinical co-ordinator. The good news is that the service will re-open shortly, but only on a limited basis and without a full staff complement. The people in charge at Headstrong promised us that a full-time clinical co-ordinator would be put in place, but that will not happen. These services are important. Jigsaw provided a vital service for young people in Roscommon, with free counselling for people aged between 15 and 25 years of age. It was temporarily closed in February due to problems with recruiting clinical staff to deliver an important one-to-one service for young people. Despite four attempts, the most recent of which occurred this month, Headstrong was unable to fill the clinical roles needed to establish a full service for Roscommon. Now, the service will only re-open on a limited basis. I want people to take note of my next few lines. In the past three years, 409 young people accessed Jigsaw's services in County Roscommon, including 96 in the past year. Jigsaw is an important service for Roscommon and everywhere else it operates. Ours was a good service. I hope that the Minister of State can do something to reinstate a full service so that young people can be looked after.

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on her appointment and my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Browne, on his appointment as mental health spokesperson during the life of this Dáil. I hope that substantial progress is made. When I think about mental health, I think about the people. I am an accountant, but this is one debate that is not about statistics and numbers. Although we could cite them today, we would be missing the point. This issue is about the hundreds of thousands of people who are suffering as we speak. People will have been surprised by our interest in this debate since it commenced a couple of weeks ago. There is not a Deputy who has not been asked by many constituents about whether he or she has contributed, or will contribute, on this debate. A large, silent group of people are watching what is happening in the Chamber. They hear talk of other issues, but these are the ones that matter to them because they are suffering in silence.It means many people suffering from mental health issues are not living their lives to their full potential. Their families are not either because there is an impact on them and their communities. The first point we have to accept is that there is no easy answer; it is a journey and there will always be a long journey to go. We all talk about how people should be more open. Men should be much more open. More often than not, the funerals of those who have committed suicide in my area are of men. Sometimes it is women. It is saddest when it is a young person. One feels he or she must have been in a very dark space when he or she felt there was no way out or way ahead. This requires understanding, not judgment. It is very easy for people to be judgmental and say, given an individual's circumstances, he or she should be better off than others. However, there is no accounting for what happens people's brains. Many people suffer from financial or emotional stress. There is more stress in the rat race of modern-day life than there used to be. Often, there are no answers when it is all said and done. This is why I say people will be on an ongoing journey. The more we talk about mental illness here, the more we will increase its priority in the national debate and political agenda. That, in itself, will lead to additional funding. It is easy to allocate an extra €10 million here or there for various services but there should be greater understanding among people as to what is actually involved. We need to accept that the mental health service has been the Cinderella service of the health services. If this debate achieves nothing but an increase in the profile of the need to deal with mental illness, it will have done everybody who suffers from mental illness a lot of good. They will know they are not alone.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, all the best in the future. I will continue on from where Deputy Fleming left off. It is a journey. When we speak of mental health, it has many connotations. It is a broad ranging and far-reaching concept and crosses every boundary, including age, gender and status. It defies adequate coverage by me in my two minutes and 49 seconds here this evening. It would be wrong of me to start without saying I did not agree with the sidelining of the €12 million from mental health services when I first entered the Dáil a number of weeks ago. I felt it was very wrong, as did many Members. Let us hope for a more positive working relationship right across the Chamber so we can deliver to all, young and old, across the country. Protesting groups, such as the Union of Students in Ireland and Mental Health Reform, are indicative of the sectors in which the cuts are having a direct impact. These include the young, the elderly, adolescents and those going through university, the adults of tomorrow. Also included are young families, the highly qualified unemployed, the poorly paid, those in JobBridge, the homeless, the evicted, the indebted, the new poor, the casualties of the Celtic tiger, the marginalised and the disempowered of society. In the words of Dr. Harry Barry, there is no joined-up thinking and the disconnect between government and reality is alarming while the crisis of suicide is escalating. As Front Bench spokesperson on children and youth affairs, I want a bottom-up approach and early intervention. I want us to start with the children. This is where it all begins. If we work with CAMHS, start out in the community and the preschool service, get relevant people into the schools and support the parents and teachers, we will actually be cutting out the problem from our queueing systems in hospitals. In 2014 in east Galway, from where I come, we lost St. Brigid's. There was an outcry over its loss. We channelled all the people with mental health issues into University Hospital Galway where there is a 250-bed unit bursting at the seams. It cannot cater for this. There are people presenting at the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Galway with psychiatric needs but it is not the right environment for them. Having gone that far into Galway city centre, they will already have sat for an hour in traffic. If one has come to Galway from Coose, which is on the boundary between counties Galway and Clare, or Portumna, which is on the border between counties Galway and Tipperary, or where Deputy Eugene Murphy is from, off down in the bowels of Roscommon, one will have been in the car for two hours, and one might be on medication. We have to think of the person driving the ill person. The latter are probably undergoing psychosis or having hallucinations. They sit praying to get to their destination. When the patient arrives at University Hospital Galway, he or she must then sit in a queue in the hope of gaining access to a bed. What really frustrates me - I did not realise this until a number of weeks ago - is that neither department talks to the other. The rooms in the psychiatric part do not feed into the overall governance. My last point is on youth. The standard operational procedure issued to CAMHS last June clearly set out that it is not the role of CAMHS to make recommendations that determine the provision of specific educational supports or resources as that is the responsibility of the Department and the National Educational Psychological Service. I want the Minister of State to find out why two Departments are making the decision. Children have to be assessed twice. This is clogging up the whole system and it is really frustrating to parents.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	It is very positive that we have been having this discussion. I listened quite intently to many of the contributions. Some excellent proposals have been made by Members throughout the Chamber. I know the Minister of State will take the very best of them and all the positive ones on board and implement them. I congratulate her on her recent appointment and wish her the very best in her new role. I am sure she will do an excellent job. Mental illness is an area she feels very strongly about. I speak for every Deputy in saying any assistance on this issue we can give will be forthcoming. The Minister of State's role is very important. Given the shocking figures on suicide and people presenting with mental health difficulties and the fact that modern communications technology and media can expose everybody to global events at the touch of a button on a telephone in the privacy of one's own home, very often when alone, I feel there is growth in anxiety. Perhaps with the exception of people at the front line in war zones or those in extraordinary circumstances, people are now being exposed to types of phenomena to which they may never have been exposed in the past. This is being treated as ordinary but I believe it is extraordinary, particularly for young people, very impressionable people and vulnerable people who are seeing all sorts of unspeakable violence and tragedy unfolding before them through social and various other media. It is a cog in a wheel but not something we should overlook either. The growth in anxiety levels is partly attributable to daily exposure to material people were not exposed to previously. It is just a cog in the wheel but it is a factor. In the future, as we try to tackle some aspects of the problem, we should consider this. Unfortunately, there have been a number of very tragic suicides in Kerry in recent days and weeks. It seems to keep happening despite all the efforts made by so many people. Families and friends of suicide victims ask what more they could do, or what can be done. The State should certainly ensure that absolutely nobody slips through the net, that everybody experiencing a crisis has help and that there is no reason for someone not to receive help. We must address crisis welfare to ensure those who are experiencing a crisis do not face problems caused by a lack of finance or restrictions to access. A person transferred to an accident and emergency unit after a road traffic collision will receive the best possible treatment irrespective of his or her financial circumstances, whereas people experiencing a mental health crisis must often join a waiting list for treatment when they present at a hospital. That is not good enough. People presenting in a crisis must be treated similarly to those who experience trauma in a road traffic collision. If such treatment is not available on the spot, the State must provide the funding needed to allow the individual in question to access treatment or assistance. This would not cost the world and would be supported by all sides in the House. Access to assistance must be provided. On maternal health, I recently attended a meeting in Tralee organised by the Nurture charity. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, to meet representatives of the group as it provides a fantastic service. One of the issues raised at the meeting was the lack of accreditation for counselling services. This issue must be addressed.  Counselling services should become part of the culture of the workplace. Given the stressful nature of employment, the provision of workplace counselling services should become the norm rather than the exception.  We must take a ground-up approach to mental health, which means people should not wait for the State to do everything. This process must be driven by every citizen, starting at primary level. Children in primary school should learn about mental health in the same way as they learn about toothache or looking after themselves through sport. It should be a mainstream, ordinary part of the curriculum.

I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, on her appointment to a very important position. I hope the Government will give her the resources necessary to tackle, in so far as she can, the issues that arise in the mental health area. As these are many and varied, I will not dwell on them in great detail other than to mention a couple of important issues. Speaking as someone who spent six unhappy months as a mathematics teacher, I believe the Government must reinvest in guidance counselling at second level. In its first year in office, the previous Government's decision to integrate guidance counselling hours in overall school hours resulted in a significant reduction in the number of guidance hours available in secondary schools. As the economy improves and more investment is made in education, particularly in second level, the issue of guidance hours should be tackled first. While this issue does not fall directly within the remit of the Minister of State, I hope she will be in a position to influence the Minister for Education and Skills and ensure action is taken on the matter. As Deputy Griffin outlined, people in every walk of life face many pressures. Young people, in particular, are under pressure caused by unrealistic expectations, social media and so forth. For this reason, the cuts in guidance counselling must be reversed as soon as possible.  The statements people make on social media never cease to amaze me. People would never dream of making the same comment to one's face or if one was willing to answer them back. I took a leaf out of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan's book by answering back on social media. It is amazing that some people who hide behind anonymity are not used to people they target answering back. Some people will call politicians every name under the sun because they believe it is fine to abuse us. While I accept that social media, as with all other media, cannot and should not be censored, an element of personal responsibility must attach to the statements people make on social media. While I do not know how this issue can be addressed, I note the House has not yet had a proper discussion of the issue.  I grew up in a household in which mental health was always discussed. In the past ten or 15 years, the stigma attached to speaking about mental health has declined, although it has not yet been eliminated. Nowadays, people feel they can speak about issues that remained unspoken previously. An uncle of mine who lived with my family spent most of his life in a psychiatric hospital where he should never have been placed. Thankfully, this no longer occurs for the most part because families and the institutions of the State are much more aware of mental health issues and must more able and better resourced to deal with them. A job of work remains to be done, however, and I hope the Minister of State, as the face of mental health in government, will ensure it continues.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	Two weeks ago, I held a public meeting in Wexford to discuss the state of mental health services in the county. Ten groups were in attendance, namely, Good2Talk, the Collective Sensory Group, Cycle Against Suicide, New Me, New Ross, the campaign for Wexford's acute mental health service, Creacon Lodge wellness centre, Eolas Soiléir, Cura, See Change and the Cornmarket Project. These groups, among others, pick up the slack when the Health Service Executive is lacking but receive very little credit for doing so and next to nothing in the way of funding. The meeting heard from people who are going through or had been through the mental health system, others who could not access services and others who wanted to break free from HSE services. There is a crisis surrounding mental health and mental health services, and nowhere is this crisis worse than in Wexford. Sadly, it is directly connected to neoliberal Government policy and the rise in inequality it has caused. Figures released last month by the charity, Mind, revealed that 46% of people with mental health problems in the United Kingdom had considered taking their lives or attempted to do so as a result of social factors such as debt and welfare difficulties. The austerity programme of the past seven years has taken its toll on the collective well-being, in particular in the area of mental health. One of the most maddening aspects of these years was observing cuts being made to mental health services just when support and resources were needed most.  Children and teenagers are being failed most. Even from a purely economic perspective, this is a disastrous position. Many studies, most recently a study carried out by the Centre for Mental Health in the United Kingdom, have shown that there is a serious economic case to be made for improving prevention and early intervention services. Money is much better spent reshaping services for children and young people and on community-based alternatives than on inpatient crisis care in general. Sending patients far from home to access acute care when they are in crisis is expensive and bad for the patient, his or her family and his or her recovery. Despite this, only ten inpatient beds are available for those aged under 18 years in the entire south of the country. These are all located in the Eist Linn centre in Cork. Let us imagine the case of a teenager who survives an attempted suicide in Wexford and desperately needs around-the-clock supervision. If he or she is lucky enough to get a bed, it will mean travelling more than 200 km. That can hardly be described as humane.  The meeting the other week, which lasted for four and a half hours, was a very troubling experience. A number of issues stood out and were raised repeatedly during the discussion. Most important was the intense dissatisfaction with the complete absence of 24-hour acute mental health services in County Wexford. It is not a coincidence that the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that Wexford has the highest suicide rate in the country. The rate doubled in 2011, one year after all acute beds in the mental health service were moved to Waterford.People in Wexford are ending their lives because the Government has made the reckless and absurd decision that the best time to provide emergency mental health services is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday. The logic of that decision does not bear thinking about when we think about the times people are likely to come under pressure. I was also struck at the meeting by the fact that nobody advocated or had anything positive to say about the medicalised model of mental health care that is promoted by the HSE. This brings us to the crux of the matter. We want better acute services but we do not approve of how these services tend to medicate rather than resolve issues and trauma. However, matters are so bad at this point that we are glossing over that concern while we call for just basic service provision. We got rid of a place that was not fit for purpose, St. Senan's, and were told that as planned under A Vision for Change, great care through community provisions would be made available. Sadly, that has not happened. In a recent response from the HSE to a parliamentary question about the numbers of people currently prescribed anti-depressant medication by the health service, it revealed that as of 2015, there were 249,900 people on eight different versions of anti-depressant medication. This quarter of a million people comprises only those on State-supported medication. Some of the listed drugs are widely known in the scientific community to be dangerous. Seroxat was declared safe by a 2001 study and was marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as safe and effective for children and adolescents for the treatment of depression, although company executives were aware that studies had shown that the drug was no better than a placebo and caused thought disturbance and suicidal behaviour in a significant number of young people. After a ten-year struggle by concerned scientists and researchers to get to the truth, the 2001 study was reanalysed and rebutted last September. However, GlaxoSmithKline refuses to retract it. Why are almost 10,000 people in Ireland still being prescribed this drug by the HSE, although we know it is unsafe? For ten years, GlaxoSmithKline intentionally deceived the public about its findings and made a killing while it knew it was killing children. Sertraline, manufactured by Pfizer, is the second most widely prescribed anti-depressant in Ireland. It also has a woeful track record. The first study of the drug took place in Leeds University in 1983 and all the subjects who took it reported apprehension, insomnia, movement disorders and tremors. Pfizer pulled the study and yet here we are 33 years later handing it out to 42,585 people. There are many alternatives to this top-down medicalised model of care, even for the most debilitating of mental health problems. For example, in western Lapland in Finland, there has been a state-endorsed programme called Open Dialogue in place for the past 25 to 30 years. In the 1980s, western Lapland had the worst incidence of so-called schizophrenia in Europe. Now it has the best documented outcomes in the western world. Today, 75% of those experiencing psychosis have returned to work or study within two years and only approximately 20% are still taking anti-psychotic medication and a two-year follow-up. The Open Dialogue approach ensures the person having the crisis is empowered and has the final word about how his or her care proceeds. Everyone involved in the crisis is invited to meet and discuss how to deal with the issue. The family, friends, care professionals, police, people who have been affected by the person and people who have affected the person are all invited to sit and discuss the best way to advance the well-being of the person in need. The Open Dialogue representative is only there to facilitate the discussion, not to judge or have an opinion about what should happen to the individual. At the centre of this process is a foundation built on respect for the individual and his or her autonomy. That alone marks a massive step forward for the person's sense of self worth and healing process. It is frightening how much needs to change about how we provide care in this area. The Government's only solid plan so far is to remove ring-fenced funding from it. I already mentioned the group It's Good2Talk. Before the election, I saw a picture showing a huge cheque for €130,000 being awarded to that group. That was a political stroke for certain politicians. However, as of two weeks ago, the group has not seen a penny of that money and has been led to believe that, for one reason or another, it will only get some of it. Will the Minister of State find out for me whether this group will get the money it was told it will get? We are all very much aware of the problems all around the country in regard to mental health and I am sure anybody who knocked on doors during the election got it by the bucketful. Sadly, for a number of years now we have also got neoliberal government by the bucketful. This has led to significant difficulties and challenges for many people. It has also led to mental health issues for many people. Now, here we are taking funding, which was supposedly ring-fenced, from an area that is already under-funded. How in God's name can we proceed with that cut? The suggestion was made that professionals could not be found for jobs to be covered by that funding. If that is the case, the money should be put into some other mental health area. We all know there is a huge need for extra funding for mental health care all over the country, not just in Wexford. I am aware the fact we have more than 20% unemployment in Wexford is one of the reasons we now have the highest suicide rate in the country but that is not disconnected from the issue of the provision of services. The Government needs to put more money into mental health care.

Like many Deputies, I had to make a number of requests for speaking time on this issue, which gives an indication of the impact of mental health problems in every constituency. Depression, anxiety and other such conditions do not discriminate but affect people of all ages and backgrounds at any stage in their lives. Addressing this issue is a huge challenge for our new Minister for Health and I wish him and the Minister of State well in that respect. I recently met with the Kilkenny consumer panel on mental health services, a voluntary group of service users, family members and staff working in partnership to improve local mental health services. They are extremely concerned that the mental health budget has been raided to the tune of €12 million. We all understand there are great pressures on the health services in this country but I cannot overstate my view strongly enough that mental health services should not be subject to any diminution of funding. The mental health situation in this country is reaching epidemic levels and we need investment, as opposed to cuts, to improve staffing levels, the provision of services and the quality of care available in all parts of the country. Service users, their families and friends and those who continue to suffer in silence need to see investment in psychiatry and psychology health professionals. They need sustained and meaningful engagement between the Department of Health and groups such as the Kilkenny consumer panel to identify the best ways to help those who suffer the most and those who suffer in silence. People who come forward and speak openly about their experience with mental health problems are to be commended on doing so as they inspire hope for those who remain silent. However, it is those who suffer in silence who are most at risk of allowing a mental health problem to fester and manifest itself through real physical harm, such as suicide. The Kilkenny consumer panel recently wrote to the Minister expressing its legitimate concerns. I have a copy of that correspondence for the Minister if he or the Minister of State would like to see it following this debate. Groups such as Men's Sheds have saved countless lives and must be supported further. I met with the group's CEO, Mr. Barry Sheridan, recently and he explained to me that it has a budget shortfall of €200,000 per year. This is a lifesaving network that is attended by more than 10,000 men per week in 300 communities in Ireland. Mr. Sheridan explained to me that the group receives three or four requests for new sheds to be set up every week. This means there are three or four communities coming forward every week seeking help from Men's Sheds because of the demand for effective mental health services that work in their towns or villages.The HSE must provide avenues of funding to groups such as Men's Sheds but I dare say that their work is being undervalued. Increased investment could go a long way in such organisations and, ultimately, save lives. Will the Minister of State address the clear and apparent problems we are having with recruitment? What action is she undertaking to find out why psychiatry and psychology graduates are choosing not to enter our mental health service and what provisions are being pursued to ensure that such posts are filled in the future? Fianna Fáil is committed to reviewing what still remains to be achieved under A Vision for Change and it wants to see an updated plan for 2016-2026. A Vision for Change was brought in for the 2007-2011 period by the former Minister of State, John Moloney, who had forward thinking ideas about mental health. We all know about what were the old mental homes and we know of the importance of getting people out and integrated into the community. That was what A Vision for Change was about and it needs to be pursued by this Government. We need to properly fund our mental health services as current funding is insufficient to deliver the staffing levels envisaged by A Vision for Change.

I wish her well in her new important role and I guarantee my support in anything she endeavours to do to raise awareness of the importance of good mental health. I thank Deputy Aylward for sharing his time with me. I have been waiting a long time for this slot, which shows the importance of the issue. Peace of mind is a natural condition and is available to everyone. Good mental health strengthens and supports our ability to have healthy relationships, make good life choices, maintain physical health and well-being, handle the natural ups and downs of life and discover our potential and grow toward it. Businesses benefit when employees have good mental health. Mental health is associated with higher productivity, better performance, more consistent attendance and a reduction in workplace accidents. It is imperative that businesses provide workplace support for people who are going through a hard time in their lives. Early intervention is extremely important in the whole area of mental health. If a person is feeling down, it is imperative that there are services and supports available to help prevent their feelings from escalating and becoming unbearable. The whole notion that it is okay not to be okay needs to get out there more. In general, we are very quick to discuss and seek help for physical conditions and problems but very slow to speak of or seek help if we are feeling down or feeling vulnerable. There need to be more helplines available and maybe an idea would be to increase the number of age-appropriate helplines. The important thing is that people feel encouraged to use these lines. We need to engage and implement a robust strategy to ensure that every man, woman and child in Ireland feels thought of, cared for, safe and well.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I thank the Deputies and the Acting Chairman. The number of people who want to speak and the fact we are debating who goes first are indicative of the seriousness with which the public and Deputies across the House take the issue. When the debate started, there was a big outcry on social media that we were not in the Chamber and were not interested in speaking but that reflects the lack of public knowledge about how this House works. It is normal for people not to be in the Chamber during part of a debate. It also showed that people wanted to engage with and to watch this Parliament for once because we were discussing an issue of critical importance. Mental health is hugely important. During the nominations for Taoiseach, I read out a letter from a woman in my own constituency whose family had been very much affected by this issue. Her family ran into financial difficulties around mortgage repayments, resulting in relationship breakdown, and she was unable to access mental health services in her area. Ultimately, the woman died through suicide and the family was left with many unanswered questions. After I read the letter out, the amount of feedback I received really showed how much this issue had affected so many people. It touched people and people saw in it something of their own circumstances, or those of their sister, family and so on. The link between austerity and mental health issues cannot be ignored as the two things are intrinsically linked. So many people are now experiencing these issues that one cannot divorce it from what is happening. We have seen an undermining of the social fabric like never before. We have seen an undermining of the concept of public services and a greater emphasis on individualism, which is contributing to isolation and is very unhealthy for people. Psychologists Against Austerity have called neoliberalism "poisonous public policy". It is fairly obvious when one thinks about the unspeakable pressure people have come under as a result of their situations; they are perfectly predictable and natural reactions to what they are faced with. If one takes away people's security of employment and housing and leaves them to drown in debt while taking away their social protection and removing community supports, it is no surprise they suffer and that their mental health suffers. One in five suicides worldwide is linked to unemployment and job insecurity and huge numbers of suicides are linked to depression and anxiety as a result of not being able to access a job. In this context, cutting mental health services is like closing oncology departments after a nuclear disaster. It is the last thing one should do. The fact that the mental health budget has been even touched is absolutely scandalous and is the wrong answer to the issue. Actions speak louder than words. The first day Deputy Enda Kenny was elected as Taoiseach he spoke about the need to teach young people resilience and said that they and their families could access the services they need. Resilience has a particular meaning in mental health services but to hear the Taoiseach say that, when the actions of the last Government have actually contributed to poor mental health, is not acceptable. There were cuts to mental health budgets to the tune of almost €214 million, or 21%, between 2009 and 2015. There is a link and those in power have to take responsibility for that. People could infer from the Taoiseach's remarks that they would have to put up with whatever was thrown at them. The facts as they relate to Ireland show that we are performing very poorly. Ireland has the fourth highest rate of suicide in Europe among young people aged between 15 and 19. Almost one fifth of people aged between 19 and 24 have experienced some type of mental health problem and 75% of mental health difficulties arise before the age of 25, so that age cohort must be our starting demographic. Young people in society need our help the most. The Taoiseach directed them to the services but sometimes the services are not there. Sometimes they are, of course, and I praise the great initiatives that have been taken, such as the Jigsaw programme in second level schools where young people engage in peer mental health tutoring with their school colleagues.It has been shown scientifically that if young people talk and open up to other young people - perhaps those who are a little older than themselves and might be perceived as cool kids in the way younger teenagers look up to older teenagers - they take in much more from such peer mentoring than they would from adult mentoring. The programmes being run in our second level schools are absolutely worth their weight in gold. They encourage young people to talk and open up. They emphasise that there is no such thing as a small problem or a problem that cannot be shared. This service is an asset that needs to be developed. Pumping people up on anti-depressants is not the best way to deal with these issues. People often need counselling. They need to talk and listen. In many cases, people do not have the money for such services because they are privately run. It can cost between €60 and €100 an hour to continue with counselling. Those who cannot afford private services have to wait for months to access the services provided by the public system, which do not extend beyond a maximum of eight sessions. We cannot have a health service like that. It is letting people down and costing lives. That is why any discussion on mental health must be linked with economic policies. Neoliberal economics is directly at odds with the idea of good mental health. I do not have time to speak about the fragmentation of mental health services, as evidenced by the presence of different providers. Instead, I will focus on the issue of mental health in prisons. The Jesuit Centre for Justice and Faith, which made an excellent presentation to us this morning, has released a report about young people in prisons and the dangers of solitary confinement. All of the empirical evidence shows that a significant proportion of those who end up in prison have mental health problems. People with such problems are disproportionately represented in our prison system. We have not managed to find a proper system of interim care between the old institutional model that prevailed in years gone by and the care in the community model that exists now. There is a gap there. Many people end up in our prisons because they are responding to behaviour, trauma or crises that happened earlier in their lives, when their mental health issues were not dealt with. It is enormously expensive to keep some someone in a prison. The best way to deal with someone who has mental health problems does not involve putting him or her into an environment where, at best, he or she will be locked up in their cells with one or two other prisoners for 17 hours a day. Some people can be in solitary confinement or lock-up scenarios for 23 hours a day. These are the mechanisms that drive people to mental health problems. Clearly, such an approach does not help people to sort out their problems. At this morning's meeting, Fr. Peter McVerry and others suggested that the services in our prisons should not be equal to what is in the community - they should be better than what is in the community. That might sound a bit mad but there is a need to re-tilt the balance. One of reasons some people end up offending and getting involved with our criminal justice system is that they have not been given the supports they need. Once they are linked in with the system, we should be going over to help them sort out their problems. This area needs huge consideration, particularly in light of the correlation between young people and offending and the prevalence of mental health issues among young people.  Everybody in this House has a genuine desire to tackle these issues. This is one of the biggest problems facing Irish society. We have to back up our approach to it with the empirical studies showing that economics feeds into mental health difficulties. A different type of tack needs to be taken from an economic perspective if we are to deal with this issue.

I am not sure whether it is good to draw a dichotomy between health and mental health. I know we need to accentuate the whole mental health argument in order to raise awareness of it but at the end of the day, it is all about health. I think we will have reached a successful point when people regard their mental health as an essential component of their overall health and well-being. I hope we will reach a day when we do not need to talk about mental health as opposed to physical health. The demand for speaking time during the debate on mental health reflects well on this Parliament. Like some of my colleagues, I am getting to contribute to this discussion at the third attempt. My slot is quite short. There has been a rich tapestry of contributions from Deputies on all sides of the House. Everyone has had something unique to contribute to the debate. I know the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will take that on board. Her task is to parse what has been suggested and come up with a cohesive policy. Many of my colleagues will know that there was a positive protest on the street outside the Dáil in recent weeks. As I was walking back in through the gates of Leinster House that day, I heard someone call my name. It turned out to be an 18 year old student from my constituency who had taken a half-day from school to be here. The person in question had walked to Kildare Street because they wanted particular issues to be raised. When I stopped at a petrol station in Rathfarnham on my way home that evening, I ended up engaging in two conversations with constituents on the whole topic of mental health, which was quite live at the time. All of this shows that this is a big issue. The Minister of State does not need me to tell her that. I would like to focus on a couple of issues during my brief comments. I am not making a political argument when I mention that the establishment of a national mental health authority was included in Fianna Fáil's manifesto for the recent general election. I suggest that a national mental health authority, filled with experts from across the wide range of mental health fields, is badly needed to co-ordinate the entire public policy approach to mental health and to give mental health a central position in national dialogue, policy and development. A national mental health authority could ensure every Department and Government decision is mental health-proofed. We have never done that before. Other kinds of proofing take place when decisions are made by the Government but we need to engage in mental health-proofing to improve awareness of the downstream effects of Government and Department decisions on mental health. We need to look at the crude figures for investment in mental health and in structures supporting mental health from a cost-benefit perspective. It has been proven in other jurisdictions, including Australia and New Zealand, that such investment results in a reduction in health premiums in line with the reduction in the cost of mental health difficulties to health insurers. I am bringing the debate down to the brass tacks of figures. We also need to start a more coherent and developed national mental health conversation. The recent appointments to the Seanad indicate that my party is taking seriously the need for such a conversation. Many people of all ages are not aware that their mental health can suffer in times of stress, crisis and loss. This is a big issue that needs to be addressed. Having worked in this field for a number of years, I am aware that this aspect of the matter can come as a surprise to many people. Many of my clients were really taken aback by how they were responding to previous traumas or crises. Many people are not aware that it is perfectly natural to feel bad or down - or "abnormal", as my colleague said - in the teeth of or the aftermath of a crisis or loss. Many people are not aware that when we suffer loss or trauma, the body holds onto it and finds some kind of way of letting that loss or trauma go. How could we be aware that it is okay to feel sad, down, angry, frustrated, anxious, hopeless or depressed when our national stereotype involves suffering in silence? We need to break that kind of stereotype. I have much more to say on this issue but time has run away with me. I will finish with a sentence that is known across the psychological field: "Lack of expression leads to depression". We are still on statements but action will be needed at some point. I look forward to seeing what the Minister of State proposes out of the fruits of these statements.

Tá jab an-tábhachtach le déanamh ag an mbeirt acu. Guím gach beannacht orthu. When one lives in a town that has a river running through it, the sound of the search and recovery chopper coming over the town brings fear into every house. The closer one lives to the river, the more clearly one can see the Air Corps crew of the chopper as they fly over the river, with the heat-seeker going up the river, looking for somebody who has sadly ended his or her life.There are other ways to look for people but that is the most public way. It is the one thing that frightens people who live along a river. We all need to work collectively to bring an end to that. The figure of 554 people who ended their lives through suicide has to come down. My party has proposed the establishment of an authority similar to the Road Safety Authority with ring-fenced funding so that civil servants do not get to play with the budget to suit their needs and we do not have a repeat of the €12 million reallocation incident a few weeks ago. As a country, we need to collectively change our mindset. Deputies John Lahart and Margaret Murphy O'Mahony touched on the fact that this issue is one for all of us. Our mental health is as important as our physical health and in the same way we treat our physical health, we must treat our mental health. I believe young people are leading the way on this and I really want to acknowledge the work that young people did to initiate the Mindspace project in Mayo. It was a team of volunteers, led by Breda Ruane from the Mayo Education and Training Board, which involved young teenagers in transition year from around the county, who put the legwork in to create Mindspace in Mayo. It is a kind of recreation of the Jigsaw project in Galway, which does fantastic work. We need to invest in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, and in the rolling out of the CAMHS model across the country. More importantly, we need to roll it out consistently. Geography should not dictate what level of service, what access to service or what speed of service one gets. There should be a consistent model of CAMHS across the country. Similarly, that is why restoring guidance counselling is so important in secondary schools. There is a generation that has a notion of guidance counselling as being the career guidance teacher we all spoke to. It is a much broader and more holistic concept than that. It is the person in the school who identifies and works with young people who are going through issues and it is in school that one is more prone to such issues. A proper, functioning guidance counsellor in place will start to work with people who come under mental health pressure at school from an early age. It is important to get them into the service at an early age. As we all know, early intervention is absolutely crucial. Why do we still force people to go through the old accident and emergency system to get emergency mental health cover? One does not want to be in the accident and emergency department. If one is under physical pressure, one has to be. However, if one is under mental pressure or mental stress, it is the last place one needs to be. We need to roll out a system of proper 24-hour emergency mental health care around the country. Again, geography should not dictate service or access. As long as we push people through the accident and emergency system, many will leave it, not go through it and, as a result, will not have that recovery experience or receive the kind of coverage that we have. An issue that was raised in the last Dáil by the health committee was that we, as public representatives, and our staff need training on how to deal with constituents who come to us. I fully agree with Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly that we have stirred up a major problem in this country. If we think we have problems now with our mental health, the events in family homes across the country in the past eight or nine years will store up a further avalanche of problems, unless we decide to invest properly in people from an early age and decide to take this seriously. Geography should not dictate what service one gets, whether one goes private or public, or whether one can recover from an incident quicker than otherwise. As Deputy Lahart said, we are all only one incident away from a mental health crisis. Nobody is immune to it. We need to embrace it and work at it as a country, as public representatives and ultimately, as a Government.

Guím gach rath orthu le sin. I wish them every success in their positions and I congratulate them on their recent appointments. When the people of this country reach out for help, it is critical that they are able to find good quality services and supports. We are more than a decade on from A Vision for Change, which was commissioned by the then Minister for Health in response to a widespread need for improved mental health services. It identified the critical structural, human and financial resources required. Sadly, the early momentum and progress that was achieved at that stage by A Vision for Change was not maintained. Things have slipped back over recent years. That happened during a time of increased demand for mental health supports. The consequences of increased demand alongside the slip back led to much larger increases in waiting lists for children and adolescents and people seeking emergency treatment. For example, the figures in Cork are astounding. According to HSE figures, there were 537 children waiting to be seen by child and adolescent community mental health services at the end of last year. Alarmingly, 115 of those children and young people had been waiting for more than 12 months. It is very easy to dehumanise it but behind all of those figures there are real people suffering in isolation who are very distressed and very distraught individuals. In many cases, the families around them are suffering the same way. I wish to acknowledge the huge community initiatives such as the Darkness Into Light movement and Cycle Against Suicide. These are predominantly driven by younger people who are bringing people together, increasing awareness, fundraising, talking about the issue, raising the profile and making people realise that it is okay to feel the way that they do. Unfortunately, we are still 3,000 staff short of what was recommended in A Vision for Change. That needs to be dealt with to ease pressure and to tackle the waiting lists. What is needed is an enhanced focus and resources for mental health services. Mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health in terms of the development of State resources. We need to see the establishment of a national mental health authority to ensure that there is a single organisation tasked with the co-ordination of mental health services. We need a full review of what is still left to be achieved in the strategy and a revamp of the plan to get it back on track. We also need the reinstatement of an implementation review group which will issue regular reports on the progress being made to deliver the strategy. The people and the resources need to be put in place and not siphoned off to other areas as we unfortunately saw a number of weeks back. The challenge is not isolated to the health services. Previous speakers identified the education system where we saw the removal of the ex-quota guidance counsellor. Unfortunately, that had a knock on effect in schools around the country. Guidance counsellors were able to offer many services aside from talking to people, accessing services and so on. It was done in a way that if a student who was distressed wanted to go and use the service, nobody really knew whether he or she was going in to inquire about the CAO, career guidance or some other distressing issue he or she had. That was a big loss in schools. If schools had been able to maintain the service, the focus would have been shifted in the service's restricted time and CAO and career guidance would have trumped guidance counselling. This service was lost at a time when young vulnerable people were at a particularly tough time in their lives. We need to see the reinstatement of that guidance counselling service in schools to be able to support people at that critical time. I know it was a significant part of my party's discussions during Government formation earlier this year. It is something that is key and we need to see it delivered on. The provision of mental health services must be a priority for Government. Far too many people have been suffering from mental health issues in isolation and are not receiving the help and support they need from the State at the right time.

The previous Government was devoted to cleaning up the economic mess. Now, Ireland is in a strong position to grow again. My party's priorities are all about making sure the benefits of strong growth are fairly shared and about working to improve the quality of life for working people. For us, getting the economy back on track was not an end in itself, it was a means to getting people back to work and getting pay back into their pockets. Who else in government would have ensured that Ireland, uniquely, would have delivered two rises in the minimum wage against the backdrop of the worst economic recession in our history? As the economy continues to recover and unemployment continues to fall, we want to see the benefits of recovery translated into better working conditions and improved pay, particularly for low-paid workers. Of course, the world of work is changing fast. Workers have adapted to more flexible terms and conditions but, in all this change, we need still to protect the basic requirement of decent standards for working people. Work is not just an input into production, it is about human dignity and respect. For some people, the needs of the economy require labour to become commoditised. We reject the forced casualisation of jobs. We reject a future that sees workers become trapped in job and income insecurity or in a succession of short-term, low quality jobs, with no access to adequate social protection. In particular, there are too many women now working in jobs that are poorly paid, insecure and outside or at the very edge of our employment protection laws. I and my party have no interest in the notion of "jobs at any price" or in the spread of casual labour at the lowest wages. This Government and Dáil must not preside over an economic recovery model that is fuelled by a ruthless race to the bottom or the sacrifice of employment rights that have been hard won and that are the mark of decency and a progressive society. What people want, and are entitled to, are sustainable, secure and reasonably well-paid jobs. Therefore, what we have outlined in the motion is a programme to tackle abusive terms and conditions of employment, such as low pay, insecure hours and enforced and bogus self-employment. We are seeking to continue with the work we started in government. We installed a Labour Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Ged Nash, now a Senator, whose role was to insist that this country needs not just more jobs but quality jobs. During his period with responsibility for labour affairs, he drove the Labour Party agenda of making work pay, enhancing dignity at work and reducing inequality. That is why we set up the Low Pay Commission, why we brought in new industrial relations laws to rebalance the interests of workers and employers and why we turned public attention to the abusive relationship that surrounds the casualisation of work. Let us be clear about this. We are not a nation of Luddites. We have a small, open economy and we respond to the needs of the global marketplace. We recognise there are sectors in the economy that place a premium on flexibility in the workplace. However, for us in the Labour Party, the basic requirements for a decent working life must be maintained. We want the right balance between enterprise's need for flexibility and a worker's right to job security - to a basic level of predictability in the terms and conditions of work. There is a growing number of people in precarious employment, that is, non-standard employment that is poorly paid, insecure or completely outside the employment protection laws. Precarious employment is not gender neutral: women are invariably over-represented in this type of work. In government, we highlighted several of these issues. First, we commissioned research and recommendations on zero and low hours which show we have a serious and growing problem. People working under these contracts are being told, in effect, they can work on a casual basis. For these workers, hours at work and payslips can vary dramatically, with no guarantee of any work at all from week to week. These workers do not know from one week to the other what they are to be paid or how they will face consistent bills. Erratic pay produces massive insecurity and is entirely destructive of any attempt to plan finances and plan a future for workers and their families. These are frankly perverse arrangements aimed at downgrading the status of employment. Workers are entitled to basic security in their employment in order to plan lives for themselves and their families. We believe this Dáil must legislate to bring these abuses to an end. However, dealing with a phenomenon of this scale - protecting workers against the casualisation of jobs - will require more than just one quick-fix legislative amendment. It needs detailed collective consideration and the agreement of this House. Low pay must continue to be high on our agenda. The minimum wage is but a starting point and we want to go further. The minimum wage is our statutory floor, whereas the living wage is different. It recognises there are sectors in the economy in danger of becoming addicted to low pay and there are many employers who can afford to but refuse to pay more than the statutory minimum. The living wage is an independently assessed and agreed measure of the income necessary to meet basic needs, such as housing, food, utilities, clothing, transport, health care, child care and recreation. From the Government's viewpoint, the living wage boosts taxes, reduces the welfare spend and allows for investment in essential public services. I accept that progress on this will have to be incremental and that it cannot be done at the stroke of a pen. In government, the then Minister of State and now Member of the Upper House, Ged Nash, took the first steps to put this on the public agenda at a forum for employers, unions and civil society. The Dáil needs to go further. We need to look perhaps at the UK experience and at the benefits provided for society, for the economy and for businesses there. I believe we can ensure that the State and all State agencies will become living wage employers and that we should impose a living wage condition on public procurement contracts. I also believe that, in the lifetime of this Government, increases in the national minimum wage should be continued until it reaches two thirds of median income. It is high time we set about legislating for common and comprehensive definitions of employment and self-employment so there will be one definition for tax, social welfare and employment protection purposes. We need to crack down on bogus self-employment practices that exploit workers and leave them without legal protection. There was, in truth, only so much that we could do during what was a short period in office. The then Minister of State, Senator Nash, delivered on the recommendations of Low Pay Commission and the national minimum wage, and he produced collective bargaining legislation and laws on registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and the re-establishment of the joint labour committees. However, like any busy Minister, he left some work undone. Many of the issues that need to be addressed now are set out in the motion which we have put before the House. We do not want the foot to be taken off the accelerator with regard to these important objectives. That is why we wrote last week to all parties and groups in this House, looking for consensus on these matters. When we drafted the motion, we hoped to attract support from a wide range of groups and parties - in fact, everybody with a progressive view of work. When we wrote to all the parties, Sinn Féin - typically, immediately and out of hand - rejected any effort at co-operation with us. That is not too surprising. Sinn Féin is a party of professional contrarians, opposed to everything and anything, including the Opposition in this House. When an agreed and progressive road forward is clearly signposted, they go yomping off alone into the wilderness. It turns out that those in the Anti-Austerity Alliance are exactly the same, except they cannot even dissent by consensus with Sinn Féin and have made their own separate amendment.The position of these two parties on our motion betrays not just their churlishness but their ignorance about the issues. It passes belief that any party which seeks to support Irish workers could know so little about the current industrial relations landscape. Sinn Féin and AAA-PBP state we in the Labour Party did nothing to protect the rights of Dunnes Stores workers and that we failed to provide specific or adequate legislation. Do they not know that this very week the Labour Court is hearing the claim against Dunnes Stores brought by Mandate, or that the claim has been brought under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act that was introduced last year by the then Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash? The Dunnes Stores dispute will be one of the first hearings under the new legislation. I am entirely in sympathy with Mandate in its struggle against the stubborn refusal of Dunnes Stores management to provide its workers with some certainty on hours and earnings. The refusal of management to sit down and negotiate with the workers through their union is nothing short of a national disgrace. The workers have shown real courage and conviction in pursuing their case and I and the Labour Party fully support them. I and my party did not just mouth off about this issue. We are not content with simply carping and whinging. We challenged and changed the law and we put the workers on a proper footing. The new Act allows the Labour Court to intervene, even when employers do not turn up, and it allows the Labour Court to issue binding determinations on pay and conditions that are enforceable in the Circuit Court. The Labour Court can now look to comparators, both unionised and non-unionised, and it can see what collective agreements have been established as the norm for the sector. John Douglas and his union welcomed the Act. They are prepared to engage with the legislation and advance their workers. In the same way, Mandate has also welcomed our investigation into zero and low-hour contracts. This is real political leadership and engagement and real co-operation with the labour movement in all its branches. It is the way real progress is made. It is the way the Labour Party operates. As I stated on the day I became leader, the Labour Party does not do theatrics. We offer real change and real solutions to people's dilemmas. Sinn Féin and the Trotskyists, on the other hand, have a critique but no solution. Quite frankly, they are out of their depth when it comes to genuine industrial relations issues. We are almost at the first anniversary of the Clerys liquidation. That liquidation was engineered so as to ensure the Clerys building was separated from the employees and staff. I welcome to the Gallery some of the Clerys workers to view the debate. The actions taken by the company amounted, I believe, to an effort to subvert both company and employment protection law. We need to emphasise that the workers are not out of pocket as regards statutory entitlements. The State became obliged to pay all the sums that were due to the company's employees. It is the taxpayer that bears this multi-million euro loss. I hope the Minister, in replying to the motion, will be able to give us an update and to spell out in clear terms the current position on the various initiatives taken by the former Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash, under the previous administration. He published a report which outlined Companies Act provisions enabling the courts to ensure that all assets that ought to be available to the creditors can be clawed back for their benefit. The as yet untested section 599 of the Companies Act featured in this analysis. The report pointed out that the Minister for Social Protection had standing as a preferred creditor in the winding up, and that this remedy was potentially available on behalf of the workers who are out of pocket. I understand the Attorney General has now advised on this issue and I ask the Minister to inform the House on what action is to be taken in this regard. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the former Minister of State, Senator Nash, appointed two experts to examine legal protection for workers where operations and assets were moved to separate legal entities. Mr. Kevin Duffy, chairman of the Labour Court and Ms Nessa Cahill, a company law specialist, have published their report with recommendations and it is on the public record. Will the Minister tell us what is her attitude and that of the Government to these recommendations? When can we expect to see action on foot of the report? It would be a pity if the change in administration resulted in less impetus to drive forward these urgently needed reforms. The priority must be to ensure that situations such as that which befell the Clerys workers can never happen again. Our motion meets this requirement and I hope it will enjoy support across the House. This would be the signal we would give to people under pressure in the workforce tonight. I commend the motion to the House.

I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and my neighbour, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, on their appointment, I strongly urge them to ensure this happens. We need to maintain the progress made by the Government of 2011 to 2016, beginning with one of its first acts, which was the restoration of the minimum wage that had been axed by Fianna Fáil. Many thousands of workers in this country still struggle to pay their bills and we intend to champion their cause, as we did - particularly through the leadership of Senator Ged Nash - while in government. We make no apology for focusing on low-paid workers. They should not have to worry about an unpaid bill or the cost of food. They should have bread and roses; enough to live on and something left over for the enjoyment of life. As Deputy Howlin has just said, more than 60% of those on the minimum wage are women. Despite the fight for equal pay for equal work, some sectors which are predominantly female in their workforce have appallingly low rates of pay. I commend the former Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash, who asked the Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations on the low pay of women. I call on the Minister and Minister of State to ensure these recommendations, when they are devised, are implemented. The sectors involved include child care, shop work and cleaning. The two increases in minimum wage and the new employment regulation order for contract cleaners have made some welcome improvements, but we need to move to a situation where the minimum wage rises further, to reach 60% of median earnings and to where a living wage of €11.50 per hour applies throughout the public service. Women working in child care are among those on the lowest of incomes. It is crucial for families, but also for those working in the sector, that the commitments to invest in the cost of child care are fulfilled. Quality care and education in the early years of a child's life make an enormous difference to each child's development and chances in life. Those who work in the sector are extremely dedicated but their pay is generally minimal, even if they have a third-level or post-graduate qualification. The suggestion made in the early life of the Government that tax breaks should be used to assist parents with the cost of child care would have done nothing to make child care more affordable, have better quality across the board or be better paid. I am glad the Government has given an assurance that it will not follow this course and I will continue to press for direct support to the sector instead. Continuing to increase the minimum wage will secure a share of the growing national prosperity to all workers in child care and other low-paid sectors. I remember going to my local petrol station in the depths of winter and the two women working there had smiles on their faces because the minimum wage had just increased. These are the workers we want to support. Others we want to protect through the motion are freelance workers, those forced into bogus self-employment and those on if-and-when contracts. Dr. Michelle O'Sullivan and her team at the Kemmy Business School in the University of Limerick, UL, did a fine job in the comprehensive report they carried out on zero-hour contracts and their impact. Their recommendations are practical and fair and I support what my party leader has just said, that they must be implemented. The same is true of the proposals in the Cahill-Duffy review carried out following the shocking overnight closure of Clerys - and I also welcome the workers to the Gallery - and the separation of assets that callously deprived workers of protection. One of those workers raised an issue with me when I spoke to her this morning, which I promised to raise this evening. A colleague of hers, having worked for decades in the retail trade in Clerys, secured a job in another store but, despite his years of experience, only on the minimum wage.When the minimum wage is reviewed, there should be consideration of the need to recognise years of experience in setting pay rates. We were determined to use our first Private Members' time in this Dáil to advance the rights of low-paid workers. It is an area around which we, as public representatives, should all unite. I, too, am concerned that both Sinn Féin and the AAA-PBP have decided to play politics on this issue instead of supporting the rights of workers. Again, I urge those on all sides in the House to ensure that this issue remains on the political agenda. We are very happy to have placed it there tonight and we urge other Members to support the motion.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	Workers' rights are at the core of what the Labour Party stands for and what the labour movement is all about. Only this morning I met workers at Oberstown detention centre who staged a four-hour stoppage to highlight safety concerns on the campus. The fight for workers' rights goes on. While the Government is the tool by which to implement real change, we have an opportunity in this Dáil to shape change from the Opposition benches and also through co-operation and alliance. The motion calls on the Government to prepare and introduce a legislative package that will build on what the Labour Party achieved during its membership of the previous Government in respect of strengthening workers' rights. The previous Government faced a difficult task in rescuing our economic sovereignty and steadying the ship. Despite the budgetary constraints, Labour delivered in many areas but we also admit that we were unable to deliver as much of our agenda as we would have wanted in respect of other areas. However, one area in which we unquestionably furthered a progressive agenda is that relating to workers' rights. As pointed out recently by SIPTU president Jack O'Connor, Ireland was the only country in the OECD during the global financial crisis which actually improved legislative protection for its workforce. Without Labour in government - including the work of Eamon Gilmore on getting collective bargaining on the agenda and the work of Joan Burton and the former Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash, in delivering this and many other measures to strengthen workers' rights - there would have been no progress made at all in this area. I believe that without Labour driving this agenda, the minimum wage would still be at €7.65 and the legislative architecture would be the same as when Fianna Fáil left it in 2011. Because of Labour in government, the minimum wage was increased twice. The campaigning zeal of Labour Youth ensured the concept of a living wage was placed firmly at the centre of the workers' rights agenda. We brought in new collective bargaining laws and restored registered employment agreements. Our collective bargaining legislation ensures that a mechanism for workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and terms and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. The former Labour Party Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash, spearheaded the examination of the prevalence of zero-hour contracts in the Irish economy. He commissioned a comprehensive report by UL. The study examined the evidence of the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and so-called if-and-when contracts. While both involve non-guaranteed hours of work, the main difference is that workers on zero-hour contracts are obliged to make themselves available for work, while those on if-and-when contracts are not contractually required to make themselves available for work. In the four sectors examined in the study, namely, retail, hospitality, education and health, if-and-when hours and low working hours are prevalent in the accommodation, food and retail sectors and in certain occupations in education and health, such as community care work, general practice nursing, third-level lecturing and school substitution. There are significant negative impacts for workers on if-and-when hours, including unpredictability of hours, difficulties in managing work and family life, unstable income, difficulties accessing financial credit, etc. The report also suggests recommendations to tackle if-and-when contracts. We commend these recommendations to the Government and ask the Minister to pursue a strategy which will deliver on them. When the Labour Party was in government, it prioritised workers' rights. In opposition and with this motion, we will demonstrate that we continue to hold the strengthening of workers' rights as core to that for which we stand. When this motion was circulated, Sinn Féin was very quick out of the blocks not to support it. Instead, it is advancing an amendment which is specifically designed to fail and in which it attacks the Labour Party for doing nothing when it was involved in the previous Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. Sinn Féin's partisan approach to this important issue highlights that above all else it values political positioning above making a difference.

We are seeking progressive, like-minded parties, groups and individuals in this Chamber to see the value in this motion and to vote for it tomorrow evening.

This involves opportunities for work that are productive and deliver fair outcomes, security in the workplace, better prospects for personal development and social integration. In Ireland it means, among other things, paying a living wage and giving decent terms and conditions of employment to vulnerable workers. Fairness and decency at work cannot be achieved by codes of practice or whimsical employer benevolence but must be assisted by effective legislation that will right the enormous imbalance of power between employers and employees. Business models based on a race to the bottom in standards inflict damage not only on workers but also on the prospect of sustainable growth for all. Legislating for fairness and decency will benefit society because there is an enormous connection between decent treatment and improved economic performance. Fairness and decency at work means addressing the abuse of zero-hour and low-hour contracts. It indicates a real desire to abolish bogus self-employment contracts. It entails finally confronting the scourge of workplace bullying through the enactment of effective legislation. It would mean ensuring that service workers enjoy the same protections as every other worker under the transfer of undertaking regulations. It also necessitates change in legislation to extend insolvency protection legislation to workers who are left without wages and other compensation when the employer ceases trade. Fundamentally, we need nothing less than employment rights that are fit for the 21st century to make people feel secure and productive at work. The motion before the Dáil this evening shows how we are looking to the Government to provide a fair framework of law and to promote fairness and decency in the context of employment practices. In other words, this motion is simply putting forward a workers' agenda - nothing more, nothing less. We welcome the Clerys workers to the Gallery. We met them earlier today. Of course, we are all aware of the situation that arose in Clerys: the liquidation and the developments and how matters were resolved. The principal disquiet that arose from that issue was the fact that the insolvency was preceded by a company restructuring, which involved separation of the trading business that employed the staff from its major asset, namely, the Clerys building. When the operating company was declared insolvent and went into liquidation, the employees lost their employment without any notice - some of them learned about it on Facebook - or any consultation. They did not have payment under statutory entitlements, but this was remedied by the right to recourse to statutory entitlements through the Department of Social Protection because the State is obliged to pay all sums of money due to companies' employees. It is the Department of Social Protection that bears this cost, approximately €2.5 million. However, employees in a situation such as that faced by the Clerys workers, some of whom had 46 years' service, some of whom had decades of very sterling and worthy service to the company, were left not being able to negotiate an enhanced redundancy package going beyond the statutory minimum. They therefore lost out hugely, not just their work but also any compensation that they could claim. An employer insolvency in a case such as this impacts on two sets of legislation. Employee protection is covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts, which provide a statutory minimum entitlement to redundancy payments. In addition, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 confers a right to payment of wages in lieu of notice. Finally, outstanding wages, holiday pay, commission and bonuses are protected by the Payment of Wages Act 1991. In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the employer to make these payments. If, however, the employer has disappeared into a situation of insolvency, legislation provides for payments by the Department of Social Protection. Then there is the collective redundancy legislation. Under the Protection of Employment Acts 1977 to 2007, an employer who is contemplating a collective redundancy is obliged to enter into consultations with a view to reaching agreement with staff representatives. These consultations must take place at the earliest opportunity and at least 30 days before the notice of redundancy is given. The aim of the consultation is to consider whether there are any alternatives to the redundancies. However, certain provisions of the Act are stated not to apply to employees in a business which is being wound up, and the reason given for this approach to date is that where an insolvent firm goes into liquidation, it can no longer trade. It can no longer accrue debts as it is in no position to discharge. It would be difficult to keep staff on the books, expecting them to work merely to serve out a 30-day notice period, where the employer has no resources to pay those staff. Neither would the staff need this if it merely delays access to social welfare. As Deputy Howlin stated earlier, there have been a number of developments in response to the issues raised at Clerys liquidation, including the report to the then Government by the former Minister of State, Senator Ged Nash, dealing with the application of the Companies Act. Section 599, which was first enacted in 1990 and re-enacted verbatim in 2014, is about bringing assets of a connected company into a liquidation on the grounds of fairness and equity. This is borrowed from New Zealand legislation. It does not apply in the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia. Since 1990, it has never been invoked. This is the area that should be focused upon. It seems designed to suit the situation that has arisen in Clerys, indeed it is custom built to do so. It is time to throw off the shackles and utilise the legislative section to pursue the issue that has arisen in Clerys. We do not know if it will be effective until it is tried. Let it be utilised and tested on this occasion to bring in assets of an associated company where there has been unfairness meted out to creditors, such as the employees. The sole object of this transaction was to leave the State carrying the can for the redundancy of the employees. It, in effect, represented an engineered bill being presented to the Department of Social Protection. If an ordinary person overdraws, over claims or makes a claim that is not justified, he or she is rightly pursued, even if it is only €200, €2,000 or whatever. We now have a chance to pursue persons for over €2.5 million. Let us try it. We are saying that Clerys was closed and the valuable assets were extracted from the company. The insolvent company was put into liquidation and sent out all the bills, such as redundancy bills, holiday pay and sick pay, directly to the Department of Social Protection. What transpired in this case will be attempted again if it escapes without question and without detailed investigation. Let us utilise existing law to see if it works and if it does not work, let us come back here - that is our job - to change it and bring forward laws that work. There should be no foot-dragging in that regard. I am sure we will get the advice of the Attorney General which the Minister is entitled to get. I will not say too much about the authorised officer because that is before the courts to determine whether the requirements of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 were satisfied. Contravention of the Act is an offence punishable on summary conviction with a fine of €5,000. The issue here is there is a 12 months' time limit on prosecutions which are brought in the name of the Minister and therefore they must be brought by 11 June next. We have expert reports in this area. The former Ministers, Deputy Richard Bruton and Senator Nash, announced a twin-track examination of protection in law for employees and unsecured creditors, particularly to ensure that limited liability and-or corporate restructuring cannot be used to avoid a company's obligation to its employees and unsecured creditors. They appointed two experts to examine the legal protection for workers, particularly where operations and assets may be moved to separate legal entities as part of a restructuring. This examination would specifically look at situations where valuable assets in a company are separated from the operating entity and how the position of employees can be better protected in such situations. Mr. Kevin Duffy, chairperson of the Labour Court, and Ms Nessa Cahill, an experienced company law specialist and barrister, were given eight weeks to examine existing legislation and also consider a new solution on how best to protect innocent workers in such cases. The then Minister's deputy requested the Company Law Review Group to examine legislation with a view to recommending ways company law could be amended to better safeguard employees and creditors. As the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, will be aware, Ms Cahill and Mr. Duffy have reported. Their focus was on how the interests of employees could be more effectively safeguarded where collective redundancies arise from liquidation following restructuring in which assets had been put beyond the reach of the liquidator or been transferred to a related person. Among other measures they proposed was that employees should in future have a right to consult with their employer for a minimum 30 days' period before a collective redundancy can take place, whether the employer is insolvent or not. Where a related company or person is contemplating a significant decision in regard to an asset that will lead to collective redundancies, such as refusing to renew a lease or a sale of a property, the company or person should be obliged to notify the employer who would be obliged to trigger a 30 days' consultation period with employees. Compensation for failing to respect employees' rights on 30-day consultation period should be increased from four weeks' pay to two years' pay. I refer here to section 608 of the Companies Act 2014. Where the employer transfers assets out of the business with the effect of perpetrating a fraud on employees, there should be a mechanism for recovering the assets or the proceeds of a sale. The priority is to ensure that a situation such as Clerys would never happen again. Our commitment in the Labour Party has always been that if the law is tested and proves to be ineffective, then it must be corrected. However, the jury is still out on the view taken by Ms Cahill and Mr. Duffy that the Companies Act remedies "that are already available do not appear to be in need of amendment, but more in need of use". It is now over to the Minister. I also want to address the issue of workers who are in formal insolvencies. I have met numerous workers who have fallen foul of this. Over the past number of years, those of companies in retail, construction and the hospitality sectors have gone through the formal insolvency process, such as receivership, liquidation, bankruptcy or some other process recognised by law and, as a consequence, employees in those companies are able to apply to the State's insolvency fund for up to eight weeks' arrears of wages, holiday pay, minimum notice and third party awards where the insolvent employer is not able to pay. I refer to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 2004. However, employees in companies that fold up, as Deputy Niall Collins as a solicitor would know well, and stand static are actually prevented by law from applying to the statutory insolvency fund. Such employees cannot recover unpaid wages and other amounts due like their colleagues in employments which have taken the proper insolvency routes. They are left at a serious disadvantage. I am aware of persons who are owed €30,000 and €40,000 in this way. The fact is that employees in such circumstances are left bereft of not only their employment but also their due payments. I believe it is in breach of European law because a 2008 employers insolvency directive, in Article 2(4), specifically provides for protection of employees in insolvency situations, such as the informal ones to which I am referring, where payments have been stopped on a permanent basis. The High Court recently made reference to that, which points to an inherent unfairness in the current law in the Republic. A solution to this problem would be for the Government to amend the existing legislation in line with the directive. That was the original proposal in the 1984 Act. This could then cover what is called "informal" or deemed insolvencies where the employer has given up trading or where payments to employees have ceased for six weeks or more. At present in such circumstances all one can do is enact the regulation under existing powers pertaining in section 4(2) of the 1984 Act. An application under these regulations could then be dealt with by the Department of Social Protection which already has responsibility under the solvency payments Act and the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. There are many issues here. One of the issues I have been concerned about over the years is that we have no statutory redress for bullying. Everybody agrees that workplace bullying is totally unacceptable but the time has come to take the long-awaited step of incorporating appropriated redress in employment law. To date, there has been an abject failure in respect of legislative innovation in this area, and one must go to court. It is an increasing problem in the workplace and it has negative effects, both for the alleged victim of the bullying and the employer. For the alleged victim, one often finds him or her in stress and ill health. Such workers' productivity drops off and, of course, their career development stalls. For the employer, the workplace can become dysfunctional, with poor morale and, maybe, costly litigation. There is an increased level of complaints but the insufficiency of existing measures to tackle the problem is leading to great frustration for both the employer and the employee, and there is no formal channel for resolving bullying complaints. By contrast, harassment and sexual harassment claims which are clearly and narrowly defined in the Employment Equality Acts, can be processed through the Equality Tribunal and eventually the Labour Court if necessary. In contrast, the worker making a bullying complaint has no defined redress under employment law. The lack of a statutory call to action set out by the Legislature has meant that the task of developing and applying an appropriate course of action has been left to the courts and to lawyers, and such a route is invariably costly, time consuming and traumatic for all of the parties. The task force on bullying of 2006 commented adversely on the lack of formal procedures to deal with bullying and called directly for legislation to be enacted to give effect to these proposals. Legislation should define workplace bullying, give an outline of the internal procedures that need to be put in place to deal with bullying complaints, and outline the formal route for adjudication on bullying complaints which has to be legally sound and cost effective. One must have a comprehensive definition of bullying. It needs to incorporate the tenets that bullying occurs when an individual or group of individuals behaves unreasonably towards a worker or a group of workers. One has to describe the type of behaviour which is unacceptable and state that such behaviour must be deemed to create a risk to health and safety at work. Then one must set out the use of internal procedures and the third-party adjudication that, eventually, a complainant can apply to the Workplace Relations Commission, which is now the one-stop shop for formal adjudication in the matter. The director of the Workplace Relations Commission can also dismiss claims if, in his or her considered opinion, the claim is frivolous. Regarding redress, one could give an order for a specified person to take a specified action or for compensation of up to two years' pay. Ultimately, one can appeal to the Labour Court in the manner laid out in the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Bullying is a major issue and it is surprising where it happens. In many places across the State, there are semi-State companies where it might surprise the Minister that zero-hour contracts and casualisation of employment is being applied. It must stop. Over the coming weeks, I intend to find out how many State or semi-State companies are engaged in this practice. It would be a very bad example if any State or semi-State company were engaged in any such practice. We want to stamp it out. We have the report from Limerick, which we should act on and implement. These are pointers given in a constructive fashion by the Labour Party. The Minister will find us a constructive party. We are unashamedly returning to 1912 and 1913 to pursue a workers' agenda. Woe to the begrudgers.

The Government will support a social economy model to deliver a strong economy and a fair society. Many positive actions have been taken in the recent past. Very progressive proposals are included in the new programme for partnership Government. These proposals will enhance the well-being of our people and protect the most vulnerable in our society. It is important to acknowledge the very significant progress in the past five years. We have seen sustained job creation and decreasing unemployment. We have maintained our focus and drive towards full employment. It is also important to take stock of the progress made in recent years in improving employment rights. We have also reformed the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations legislation used by workers and employers. First, I would like to stress the improvements in employment and unemployment. Full employment is what will make all our other plans possible, including better services, higher living standards and, ultimately, better lives for people living in Ireland. The country has witnessed a significant shift in the economy during recent years. The policies pursued are paying dividends in terms of rebuilding the economy and society. Since 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs has delivered measures agreed by the Government to promote job opportunities and employment growth in all parts of the country. Recent CSO figures show 155,000 more people are at work. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a high of 15.1% in February 2012. Employment continues to grow strongly and 47,600 additional jobs were created in the past year, most of which are full-time. Casual and part-time work decreased by 8.3%. Part-time underemployment has also fallen year on year, from 114,800 in the first quarter of 2015 to 99,100 in the first quarter of 2016. It is down from more than 150,000 in 2012. Employment growth is spread across economic sectors and the regions. Employment has grown in 12 out of the 14 economic sectors in the year to the first quarter of 2016. The unemployment rate fell in all eight regions in the year to the first quarter of 2016. These are very encouraging figures and trends. They show there is strong and continued employment growth across the economy and the regions. My priority in government is to ensure these positive trends continue. The Government will use the benefits of a strong economy to ensure we have a fair society. I acknowledge the progress made in recent years in improving employment rights to protect workers, especially the most vulnerable workers in our society. The Low Pay Commission was set up on a statutory basis in July 2015. The commission’s job is to examine and make recommendations each year on the national minimum wage. The commission is set up to ensure increases over time in the national minimum wage are sustainable and fair. It takes account of changes in earnings, productivity, competitiveness and the likely impact any change will have on employment and unemployment levels. The national minimum wage increased to €9.15 per hour on 1 January this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation to increase the rate from €8.65 per hour. The previous Government's reversal of the cut in the national minimum wage in July 2011 and increase to €9.15 ensures that work pays. The statutory minimum wage is a statement of core values. It provides a pay threshold below which society agrees workers' wages should not fall. The next report of the Low Pay Commission regarding the national minimum wage is due on 19 July. I look forward to responding to any recommendation of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage as part of the 2017 budget. As well as making recommendations on the national minimum wage, the commission has also been asked to examine the appropriateness of the lower sub-minima rates. The report is due by the end of October 2016. The commission has also been asked to examine why almost 65% of those on the minimum wage are women. This report is also due by the end of October 2016. I will highlight other major reforms in employment rights. We have seen the most significant reform in the history of the State of the workplace relations system used to vindicate employees' rights. The Workplace Relations Commission and a stronger Labour Court are in place. We have ensured the wages and conditions of agency workers were brought into line with their full-time counterparts. We have re-established the joint labour committee and registered employment agreement wage setting system, which had been found to be unconstitutional. Employees' terms and conditions can be assessed by the Labour Court if collective bargaining does not lake place. In workplace relations reforms, five bodies were merged into two, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. This change provides a better service at less cost to employees and employers. It represents the most significant reform of the State’s employment rights and industrial relations machinery in 70 years. Welcome reforms were made to our collective bargaining laws through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015, which was commenced in August last year. The legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the total employment conditions of workers can be assessed by the Labour Court if collective bargaining does not take place. The changes bring clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect. It also provides strong protections for workers against dismissal or victimisation where they invoke the provisions of the Acts. Also in 2015 the statutory code of practice on victimisation was strengthened. The stronger code explicitly provides that inducement of workers to relinquish or forego trade union representation is prohibited. This applies in the same way as victimisation of workers for availing of trade union representation is prohibited. There have been other developments in recent years also regarding wage setting mechanisms. In 2012 new legislation re-established the framework within which employers and employee representatives could work through the joint labour committee system. They can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. If their proposals are adopted by the Labour Court the Minister can make an order giving effect to such proposals. Two such orders were signed on 1 October last for the security and contract cleaning sectors. In addition, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a revised legislative framework to replace the registered employment agreement framework. This had been deemed invalid by the Supreme Court in 2013. The legislation sets out a replacement framework for registered employment agreements in individual enterprises. It also sets a new mechanism whereby pay and pension and sick pay provisions in a particular sector can be established, agreed and enforced by a sectoral employment order. Ireland's comprehensive suite of employment rights legislation sets out protections for all workers. This includes special protections for those who work on a part-time basis or on a temporary basis. For example, a part-time employee cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee. All employee protection legislation applies to a part-time employee in the same manner as it already applies to a full-time employee. Fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent workers. All temporary agency workers have a right to equal treatment with regular workers from their first day at work. I make the point that throughout the crisis the Government was committed to maintaining employment rights and particularly those protecting the most vulnerable workers in our society. If anything, where changes were made or new legislation introduced, they have improved protections. Another recent example was to provide for the accrual of annual leave while absent from work on sick leave. This change strikes the right balance between protecting the rights of vulnerable workers who are off work due to illness and the impact on business. Looking forward, I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen regulation of precarious work. To this end I am committed to considering an appropriate policy response to the report of the University of Limerick, UL, of its study of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy. All Deputies will be aware that UL was appointed in February 2015 to study the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts. Its study was published in 2015. It found that zero hour contracts are not extensively used in Ireland. However, it found that low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts. These can be regular part-time contracts with fixed hours. They can also be a contract with "if and when" hours only or a hybrid of the two. If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work. The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues. It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL. Therefore, it was essential to seek the views of stakeholders. To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a public consultation. A large number of submissions were received by 4 January 2016, the closing date for receipt of such submissions. The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL. These responses require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department. The study and the responses to it will be considered by Government with a view to agreeing the actions that should be taken. I want to welcome here tonight the Clerys workers who were treated so despicably. The closure of Clerys department store and the manner in which its workers lost their jobs was totally unacceptable and that should never happen again. It raised questions as to how the relevant provisions of employment law and company law could be exploited to produce an outcome never intended by the respective codes of law. Ms Nessa Cahill, a company law specialist, and Mr. Kevin Duffy, chairman of the Labour Court, were asked to conduct an expert examination. They examined the legal protections for workers with a particular focus on ways of ensuring limited liability and corporate restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees. The examination looked specifically at situations where assets of significant value are separated from the operating entity which is the employer. It looked at how the position of employees can be better protected in such situations. In parallel with the work of Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy, my predecessor requested the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, to review company law. This was with a view to recommending ways company law could be potentially amended to ensure better safeguards for employees and unsecured creditors. The CLRG has commenced its work in this regard. Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy submitted their report in March. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the relevant provisions of employment law and company law. It makes a number of proposals for reform of the law, which are primarily concerned with amendments to employment law. The report was brought to Government and published on 26 April. My priority now is to get considered responses to the report from interested parties. I will then bring forward a response to the report for consideration by Government. Stakeholder views will be important in assessing how the suggested reforms could operate in practice and in identifying any unintended consequences. I am pleased to say that yesterday I launched the public consultation on the experts' report, with a closing date of 17 June. I would welcome submissions from all interested parties, including members of the Oireachtas. Separately, my authorised officers have sought information from a number of parties regarding the collective redundancies that took place at Clerys and that work is ongoing. In my new role I am happy to encourage employers across the economy to adopt, on a voluntary basis, the living wage. This concept is grounded in the idea that a person's wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living but is quite separate from the national minimum wage. The living wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs. I want to assure the House of the Government's commitment to continue the significant progress made in recent years in improving the protection of workers' rights, particularly the most vulnerable workers. In this respect I look forward to working in a positive and constructive manner with colleagues across all sides of the House.

In his absence, I wish Deputy Howlin the best in his new role as leader of the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil supports the Labour Party's Private Members' motion on workers' rights. In the recent general election, my party put forward a strong suite of measures to increase job security for low-paid workers. We support fair and decent living wages for all workers. Bringing clarity to hours of work is as essential to creating decent jobs as increasing the rate workers are paid and helping vulnerable families who are reliant on welfare. Workers in precarious zero-hour contract positions face uncertainty every week as to the hours they are required to do and this leads to a lack of security in terms of how much they are actually going to earn. On a broader level, low pay and casual working arrangements prevent people from getting mortgages, entering rental agreements and being able to make financial commitments. Sadly, these people are being denied the opportunity to climb the labour market ladder further due to the lack of more secure jobs. Further impediments to securing decent jobs remain. The European Commission has correctly identified the high cost of child care and the loss of secondary benefits such as medical cards and rent supplement as significant barriers to employment in this country. Tackling job insecurity is an essential part of our commitment in Fianna Fáil to creating decent jobs and decent pay. Parties like Sinn Féin, however, prefer to preach on issues than to act and put narrow party political interests ahead of affecting real change when the opportunity presents. In the recent post-election discussions, Sinn Féin walked off the pitch and went to ground for narrow political expediency. My party chose not to absolve ourselves from collective responsibility in acting in the national interest. I note that in part of the Sinn Féin amendment to the Labour Party motion, the party seeks, true to its tactic of revisionism, to paint Fianna Fáil into the blame zone for what happened to the Clerys workers. However, yet again, when one looks up the road to the North of Ireland, one sees a similar high-profile case involving Austins in Derry. There were no utterances from Sinn Féin in the North of Ireland on that high-profile closure which involved asset stripping. In the North of Ireland, where the party is in government, Sinn Féin failed to get legislation banning zero-hour contracts through. In the recent framework for a confidence and supply arrangement to facilitate a minority Government, a policy commitment was reached to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work which prevents workers from saving or gaining job security. As the lead Opposition party, we will be ensuring this commitment is kept firmly on the political agenda and that proposals are forthcoming. Fianna Fáil supports a ban on zero-hour type contract arrangements by changing the remit of the Low Pay Commission to put forward legislation on banded-hour contracts for those on low pay. This will allow workers on low and zero-hour contracts a minimum set of hours and the right to request more hours as practised in larger retailers. We also support clamping down on exploitative bogus self-employment contracts. These contracts, which are becoming increasingly prevalent, circumvent basic employee rights to holiday pay, sick pay and pension contributions and deprive the State of PRSI and tax revenue. The issue of bogus self-employment could be rectified without legislation because people declare themselves voluntarily with the Revenue Commissioners to be deemed as self-employed. There is a basic principle of whether what is involved is a contract of service or a contract for services. It seems from those I talk to in Revenue that it is a matter of resources in terms of policing and overseeing how these declarations work. This issue is having an impact in the construction sector in particular, which is growing hugely, as well as in other areas, including the red meat trade and the forestry sector. Fianna Fáil has always protected citizens who are on low pay. We introduced the National Minimum Wage Act in 2000 which gave all employees a legal statutory entitlement to a minimum wage. The Act increased the minimum wage by 37.1% from 2000 to 2011 while Fianna Fáil was in power, which rate was greater than the rise in inflation in the period at 29.7%. While we then cut it, which was a mistake, the important nuance some of our Labour Party colleagues have failed to acknowledge was that it was cut for new entrants only. That is a significant point, although the cut itself was a mistake, which I acknowledge. Fianna Fáil welcomed the establishment of a Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations each year to the Minister on the national minimum wage. We suggested and welcomed its most recent recommendation to increase the minimum wage. It allowed a careful balance against causing any adverse effect on job creation. The State should ensure low-income workers automatically feel the benefit by an increase in their disposable income. It can do this by ensuring PRSI and tax contributions from low-paid workers are fairer. Employers in industries where profitability is improving should recognise the sacrifices that employees have made and look to increase their take-home pay, starting with those on the minimum wage, while enabling more jobs to be created. Politics should be taken out of the issue and the commission allowed to carry out its evidence-based work in its independent role. The commission must be sufficiently resourced to perform this function. Much mention has been made of a living wage. Establishing a living wage is an important measure in ensuring work pays at all levels. It is important to note that the €11.50 figure was not just plucked out of the sky. I took a personal view on it and signed the ICTU pledge on a living wage of €11.50. However, I note that significant research was done to arrive at that figure. A basket of more than 2,500 items was looked at as part of the research and they were not just looked at in Dublin. A regional view was taken. It was a well-researched figure and not one that was simply plucked out of the sky. An adequate living wage, which has been estimated at €11.50 per hour, is vital to attracting more people into the workforce. As the largest employer in the country, the Government should act as a role model in this regard. That would set a broader standard without placing an undue legislative burden upon employers struggling to keep costs down. Fianna Fáil did some research in this regard and 12 out of 15 Departments responded to our requests for information on the cost of implementing the living wage. It was indicated that the total cost for all staff directly employed across these Departments would be approximately €11.5 million. The Labour Party has been very vocal in projecting itself politically to driving forward the living wage campaign. However, it is interesting to note that four Departments led by senior Labour Party Ministers in the previous Government did not pay all directly employed staff the living wage. For many young people starting out in life, trying to get a foothold on the career ladder is increasingly difficult. We know it ourselves as they come into our clinics every day of every week. The failed JobBridge scheme has been unfairly exploited by certain employers while unpaid internships have exploded beyond short work experience to form a major part of the employment market for young people. Any successor scheme must be fit for purpose and give participants a clear pathway to securing decent work experience and learning the skills to enable them to progress up the career ladder. Mention has been made of the Clerys workers who are in the Visitors Gallery. Their plight is an appalling indictment of the actions of one particular group of vulture capitalists. It also highlights a significant gap in provisions when it is possible for a company's assets to be split in a way that puts them beyond the reach of creditors in a liquidation. Staff at the iconic Dublin department store were summarily dismissed by the new owners last June and only received statutory redundancy payments. To add insult to injury, the State was left to pick up the tab for the redundancies, as the new owners effectively shirked any responsibility to the staff. It is vital that all existing employment and company law provisions be fully implemented to avoid a Clerys-type liquidation and that further changes be examined to address any legislative gap so as to prevent a recurrence. The findings of the Kevin Duffy and Nessa Cahill report and the Company Law Review Group's examination of these matters, once completed, must be carefully examined by the Oireachtas. It is imperative that the legal framework in place be fit to deal with such situations. The industrial relations machinery of the State has stood the test of time. Under a Fianna Fáil-led Government, under changes made to the Industrial Relations Act 25 years ago, the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, was established. This conciliation body provides a professional industrial relations service for employees and employers, as well as having an industrial relations advisory, development and research services role. Sinn Féin is playing politics once more in its antics with this Private Members' motion. It is interesting that, after the Provisionals waging a violent campaign for 30 years that resulted in the deaths of members of the Garda, Sinn Féin is now pitching for headlines with its amendment to permit members of the force to strike. I speak to many gardaí and none of them has ever told me that he or she wants to have the option to strike. Citizens are indebted to gardaí for their courageous and heroic acts in putting themselves in the line of fire while policing communities daily and keeping us safe from harm. Industrial action by gardaí would endanger the stability and order of the country. There is a mutual obligation between gardaí and the Government to uphold the peace at all times. The Government must treat gardaí more specially than other groups in recognition of their role and the burdens they bear without the right to take industrial action. Fianna Fáil believes associate membership of ICTU should be extended to the Garda representative bodies to enhance their negotiating position on conditions and pay. Gardaí should be allowed to join and take an active part in negotiations.

For a reason that I will explain, I am delighted that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is present. I knew Mr. Frank Prendergast well. He was a Labour Party Deputy from the same constituency as her and his constant theme was that the gap between the bottom and the top had widened inexorably over time, particularly through percentage increases. I took what he said seriously and the evidence would support him. This is bad for societal solidarity. I realise the challenges. We live in an international world and there are international norms with which I do not agree, but they influence what happens on this island. The wider the gap between the very wealthy and the very poor, the more inexorable it becomes and the greater the disconnect in society. Therefore, this is a serious issue to be addressed and it must be examined in great detail. As a people, we must decide whether it is in anyone's interest to have an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor. I remember asking someone who had come from what would today be considered a poor rural background and grown up on a small farm whether they had felt poor when young. I received an interesting answer: "No. Is mar a chéile muid uilig. We were all the same." Everyone was in the same boat; therefore, poverty was shared by the whole community. Unlike some places we might have in mind, for example, South America, people living in great poverty were not cheek by jowl with the wealthy. Frighteningly, though, it appears from the statistics that that is where we have moved during the years. I favour a high minimum wage to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, there is a danger that people might then believe the living or minimum wage should be universal rather than the floor below which one could not legally go. What is happening at Tesco is scary. Workers are being told that their contracts will be ripped up and that they must regress. The zero-hour, if-and-when contracts seem to be unfair. When the complexity of an uncertain working arrangement is matched against the reality of the social welfare system, the situation becomes much worse. While I hope the motion will be carried, we will not be able to resolve this issue in an hour and a half. In the previous Dáil we referred the oil and gas exploration issue to a committee. Everyone sat around the table and we arrived at a report what was agreed to unanimously. We did some serious work that influenced our oil terms. The issue before us today should be referred to a committee and the Oireachtas must examine all of its aspects. Our society must decide what shape it will take. We must decide whether it will be the law of the jungle or whether we will, as far as we can with what our society can control, no longer tolerate the ever-widening gap between the very rich and the very poor. For many years I was de facto an employer because I was the manager of a co-op. I was in charge on a day-to-day basis, although I was subject to a local committee that was the ultimate owner alongside the shareholders. Whenever the union approached me, I put all of our wages, including mine, on the table. If I was claiming that the wages sought were not affordable when times were tight, it was the workers' right to know what everyone was earning, including the person on the largest salary. If a sacrifice was being sought, it had to be seen that an equal sacrifice was being made by everyone. In a company such a Tesco, however, the people at the top are earning megabucks, yet there is constant pressure downwards on the wages of ordinary people at the bottom. When this debate ends, I hope we will not say we have had our big day in the sun in raising the issue before parking it quietly. It is too big for that. I hope this debate will encourage people to see that important detailed work needs to be done, with a great deal of background research, in order that the Oireachtas might reach a coherent view on workers' rights and relative salaries in our society. If we were to do this, we would do justice a service. A very valid point was made on the radio some days ago that in many cases, the State has to supplement the wages of low-paid workers through the family income supplement, thus putting a burden on the taxpayer that the employer should bear.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	I congratulate the Ministers who are present, Deputies Pat Breen and Mary Mitchell O'Connor, on their appointments. It is a great honour for them and I do not doubt their commitment in any way. I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points on this motion. I thank the Labour Party for using its Private Members' time to bring this issue forward. We would all aspire to a living wage of €11.50. Indeed, we would all aspire to a living wage approaching €14, as suggested in amendments. In ideal circumstances, we would all like to see that. The commitment to move towards €11.50 is one I would certainly support. A year or two ago, SIPTU or congress first started the campaign to get many of us in these Houses to sign up to the commitment. It is honourable given the costs and challenges facing many households throughout the country. We need to do this. We need to be careful to have the correct balance so we do not affect competitiveness adversely. The Minister of State said the fragile recovery extends across very many sectors and regions but that is not true of the north west, from where I come. This region includes Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Cavan. In that part of the country, there are in the region of 200 empty retail shops, pubs, supermarkets, forecourts, factories and other business premises. The IDA Ireland budget predominantly focuses on the east coast or a ring very close to the broader east coast region. There is a huge challenge in this area. For the many unemployed people in Sligo, Cavan, Leitrim, Donegal and other counties next to the western seaboard, having a job for 39 hours per week that pays €350, €360 or €370 is a lot better than having a job paying €188 per week or, if one is below a certain age, even less. That is not to say we should not aspire to the figures I have mentioned. Having been a spectator of the process and practice of politics over the years and having been something of a participant as a Member of the Seanad over 14 years, I believe the evidence is clear that the money follows the population, which is a reasonable formula. It also follows senior Ministers. In the north west, we have neither a senior Minister nor a population. Nevertheless, there are citizens there who deserve equal treatment and somewhat equal access to services. They certainly need some hope in the context of the strategic vision of the Government or Oireachtas to enable their region not only to look after itself but also to contribute to the national effort in a more meaningful way. That would certainly be possible if we were prepared to begin to resource the region's strengths and to put a strategy in place that would facilitate entrepreneurs in order to seek to fill the 200 various empty business premises throughout the region. We could rebalance the IDA budget. I have concerns over aspects of what former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran, said in a recent interview. He referred to our not being able to afford rural or regional Ireland and that we need to centralise and resource the centres in a way that could cater for others. Aspects of what he said are true but the general theme of what he said is false and certainly not in keeping with the aspiration of providing for the nation as a whole. If the greater Manchester area debate takes over the strategic vision of whatever Government we have, we will lose as a nation. If we are to take a purely economic view of the provision of services to less populated parts of the country, of course people will move. If one decides to turn off water at Mullingar, the people of Sligo and Donegal will have to go there for water. If we decide to stop providing broadband for those areas, nothing is surer than that businesses will not locate there. If we refuse to provide a motorway to the north west, as we have done for many years and with no existing plans to build one, it impedes access and the somewhat futile efforts of the IDA staff in the region, who, as we know, are the best in the world at what they do. However, we are falling down as an Oireachtas in examining these regions strategically to ask how we can empower them to perform to their potential and not just regard them as a pain in the national side. Yesterday the IMD, the international centre for competitiveness, announced its results for the year. Ireland has recovered greatly, rising from 16th place last year, or certainly in recent years, to seventh. While I agree with the intentions of this motion and aspire to paying people the maximum we can, we cannot be stupid about it either. We must be thoughtful and state in policy that we want those employers who can afford it and who have turnovers and profit that support this objective to embrace it and give employees the supports they require. However, we must also acknowledge the fact that many are underperforming, not because of a lack of will to perform but because we are not providing them with the necessary tools to do so. Over the years, all Governments, including those of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Independents, considered the regions to be a pain in the national side and they threw an odd bone of placation to keep them quiet. We need to be much more strategic. The motion does not go this far but I would abolish zero-hour contracts and if-and-when contracts. They are a tool to be abused more so than to facilitate. I have concerns about what we will do with them.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to investigate irregularities regarding e-mails from publicjobs.ie and the subsequent interview selection process for candidates for temporary summer work. I know of many young people who applied for temporary work in the Department of Social Protection. It affects my constituency more than any because we have a social welfare office in Sligo. Many people, particularly young people, who applied for temporary summer positions and who were called for an aptitude test were called for interview but quite a few were not. Many of those who use Hotmail did not receive a request to come for an interview. I raise this issue because it has affected many people. Many who were watching what was happening made contact with the relevant authorities and managed to be called for an interview but there were those who were not since they were not as aware as others of what was happening. This is very unfair. I contacted publicjobs.ie last week on behalf of some of the applicants only to be told they would not be called. I understand circumstances have changed slightly since then. There are still people I know of who have not been called for an interview. It is very unfair that because of a glitch in the system, certain applicants were not notified about an interview. They did not receive the information and some of them have still not received it. It is very unfair. Everybody who did the aptitude test should be given the chance to complete the interview.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	360	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I note his genuine concern for those affected. The Public Appointments Service is the independent centralised recruitment agency for the Civil Service and public service and conducts regular recruitment competitions for the Civil Service. I understand from a parliamentary question asked today that the Deputy is primarily interested in the temporary clerical officer competition.As he will be aware, the Public Appointments Service recently advertised for a temporary clerical officer competition to fill vacancies which may arise during the year in various Departments and locations nationwide. The current temporary clerical officer competition was advertised on 23 February 2016 and closed for applications on 1 March last. When the campaign was advertised an information booklet was published on publicjobs.ie to provide candidates with all the necessary information about the role and the application and selection process. The information booklet is still available on publicjobs.ie for candidates to reference at any time. Information booklets are issued with all competitions.  The current temporary clerical officer competition attracted more than 11,500 applications. Candidates were required to complete a questionnaire for the first stage of the selection process. On the basis of their performance in the questionnaire, candidates were ranked and an order of merit created for each location. Candidates are invited to interview in order of their ranking from stage 1. The number of candidates invited to interview depends on the likely number of vacancies for the location in question. To date, 2,599 candidates have been invited to interview, of which 916 have been assigned to vacancies. A further 574 candidates have been successful at interview and are awaiting assignment as vacancies arise.  The Public Appointments Service informed candidates in the information booklet that they could expect to receive most communications in regard to the competition to the e-mail address provided on their application. Personal e-mail accounts may have filters which can result in e-mails from publicjobs.ie being blocked or directed to junk or spam e-mail folders. In the information booklet, candidates are advised to add publicjobs.ie to their safe senders' or contacts' lists of their e-mail accounts to avoid not receiving e-mails because a message from publicjobs.ie has been blocked. Candidates are also advised to check their e-mail on a regular basis as e-mail notifications of updates may sometimes be filtered into their junk or spam e-mail folder. The onus is on each applicant to make himself or herself available on the date or dates specified by the Public Appointments Service if he or she is invited to tests and-or interviews and to ensure he or she is in receipt of all communications from the service. Once an e-mail has been issued and the Public Appointments Service does not receive a notification of a failure to deliver, the service cannot accept responsibility for communication not accessed or received by an applicant. In the context of a campaign which requires a large volume of vacancies to be filled across multiple employing organisations and locations within a short timeframe, it is necessary for the Public Appointments Service to rely on e-mail communication. Once it is satisfied that e-mails have issued, there is no capacity to take further action to ensure the candidate has seen or read the message.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Helen McEntee, every success in her new brief. I am sure she and the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who is seated beside her, will do very well. I thank her for coming to the House to deal with this sensitive issue. The provision of early intervention mental health supports and services for young people in Carlow is in a state of crisis. The Carlow regional youth service offers an early intervention counselling service and runs two projects. The first of these, the Folláine counselling service, offers one-to-one support for vulnerable young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives. Unfortunately, in the past eight weeks, two 14 year old boys have died by suicide in Carlow town. This has had a devastating impact on our whole community and placed an unprecedented demand on the regional youth service support services. In 2015, the Folláine counselling service worked with 103 young people. As of 27 May 2016, a further 76 young people had engaged with the service this year and the waiting list for an appointment currently stands at 12 weeks. The leading presenting issues are anxiety, emotional difficulties, depression, self-harm and bereavement. These issues are more acute for young people than in previous years and interventions are taking longer. As a result, the Carlow regional youth service can no longer accept new referrals for Folláine. With the exception of the psychological service and child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, Folláine is the only support service that provides early intervention support for mental health and well-being in young people in Carlow town, which has a population of approximately 22,000. The service currently receives funding of approximately €30,000 per annum or €400 per client.  The second project run by the Carlow regional youth service is the YARC project. To date, 47 young people have been referred for one-to-one support to YARC. This is an increase of 50% on the same period last year and again the presenting issues are more acute and require longer intervention. In 2015, the two YARC project workers worked with 70 young people, with September being the busiest month. Both the YARC and Folláine projects have had effective outcomes for their clients, including return to mainstream education, improved emotional resilience and progression to mainstream youth work opportunities.
Based on previous experience, September is also the busiest month for the Folláine counselling service. It is estimated that an additional 65 young people will require support from Folláine in 2016. Additional funding of €26,000 is required for this purpose. To continue to offer the services of the YARC project, the Carlow regional youth service urgently requires an additional youth worker to meet current demand for mental health services for young people in Carlow town. This would cost approximately €48,000 per annum. I am extremely concerned about the lack of services available to support the emotional health and well-being of young people in Carlow. Existing organisations are best placed to respond quickly and effectively to the current and future early intervention needs in the town. These services support and alleviate demand on the Health Service Executive and Tusla specialist services. The Carlow regional youth service is a complementary service provided to schools and also offers other statutory services. It was not established to replace HSE or TUSLA services. As matters stands, it cannot accept further new referrals with its current level of funding. A task force is required in Carlow to address the current difficulties in the town. In addition to the two young people who recently died by suicide, two adults died by suicide in Carlow in recent weeks. Unfortunately, Carlow has the third highest rate of suicide by area of residence. Recent figures show that the area's suicide rate stood at 15.7 per 100,000 compared with a national rate of 11.3 per 100,000. On 24 May, Carlow regional youth service hosted a meeting which was addressed by the psychologist, Dr. Eddie Murphy, and attracted more than 300 concerned parents. I ask the Minister of State to examine the issues I have raised and ensure additional funding is found for early intervention services and the establishment of a task force in Carlow.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I thank Deputy Deering for raising this issue. Mental health in general and mental health services are very topical and I hope they remain on the agenda. In that respect, I need the support of Deputy Deering and others to ensure that is the case. The HSE national service plan for 2016 outlines a commitment to develop early intervention and prevention services for children and young people to ensure timely access to counselling and psychotherapy at the appropriate stage and to continue the development of such services into adulthood. These early intervention and prevention services have been prioritised for allocation of development funding. Existing initiatives such as the national counselling in primary care, CIPC, service have received €7.5 million for further development from the programme for Government investment in mental health since 2012. This service provides short-term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 years and over who hold a valid medical card. The Government is strongly committed to improving all aspects of mental health services, building on the additional ring-fenced funding of €160 million provided to modernise such services between 2012 and 2016. In this context, funding for mental health in 2016 will increase from the 2015 outturn of €785 million to a projected budget of €826 million. This amounts to an increase of €41 million, or 5.2%. I stress that the Government is committed to increasing funding in the mental health budget in each year of its term of office.  Mental health services in Carlow are arranged in accordance with A Vision for Change, the national policy document for mental health services. Services are delivered across the geographical location through a combination of acute inpatient and community-based facilities located throughout each extended catchment area. Access is also available to acute mental health services through the emergency department of St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, by way of the mental health liaison service which provides mental health assessment and support to the emergency department on request. Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Carlow are delivered through the Carlow-Kilkenny mental health service. The Carlow CAMHS team is consultant led and comprises a range of multidisciplinary health professionals who are experienced in working with children and teenagers with mental health difficulties. The primary referrer to the service is the family general practitioner. Substance misuse services provided by the HSE and HSE-funded agencies are based in St. Dympna's Hospital, Carlow. Service provision includes counselling, outreach and community drug initiatives and clients can be self-referred to this service. In addition, a weekly drop-in clinic is held in St. Dympna's Hospital. In addition to nationally provided services such as Console, the Carlow self-harm intervention service, SHIP, is a free, GP referral specialist counselling service for individuals aged 16 years and over who are experiencing suicidal ideation or the impulse to self-harm. I note Deputy Deering focused primarily on young people, including those aged under 16 years. The Government has committed to providing sufficient resources at national and local level to ensure each region has a full range of mental health supports available. Deputy Deering's frustration with services in County Carlow is shared by most Deputies in their respective counties. We have started at a very low base. It is important to note that while people are coming forward and more people are looking to avail of these services, this is putting an additional strain on a service that has been under pressure for some time, even with additional funding. In the mental health division in my area of Louth and Meath, while the mental health teams for young people have increased and we are now implementing A Vision for Change, gaps remain in the system and we have found it very difficult to hire the relevant staff to deal with issues and to ensure waiting lists do not get out of control or that children must wait longer than 12 months. I am conscious of the difficulty in recruiting and retaining nurses in the mental health area, and for that reason I am happy to inform the Deputy that the HSE is reintroducing a one-year post-registration programme in psychiatric nursing for nurses who are already registered in either the general intellectual disability or children's division of the register. This programme is being provided through the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and UCD and I hope it will start in August. This programme will provide a small number of places and can only make a small impact, but it is a start and I am committed to ensuring it is done. If the Deputy feels there are other issues outside of recruitment and staffing that need to be addressed within the services of the county, I would be happy to visit his constituency to meet the teams there and to try to address the problems there.

The issue relates to the extent to which the county town of Naas in County Kildare has been affected by the economic downturn. The various efforts that have been made to address this issue so far have been unsuccessful, despite the best intentions of all involved. The purpose of raising this issue is to encourage the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to use his powers of persuasion with the local authorities to try to achieve some movement on the procedures that have been stalled. Arbitration has moved extremely slowly over recent years and is now stalled again and postponed for another year. This means we must see the continual reminder of the tower cranes stalled like animal predators on the skyline. These stalled cranes are symbolic of what has happened. Despite the best efforts of the local authorities, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the business people of Naas, we have not been able to move the project ahead and return to a situation where we can see movement taking place. Usually, the sight of tower cranes over a town, village or city is a sign of growth, activity, development and economic well-being. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs that are now hovering over the town of Naas do not give that impression at all. With each passing day and week, there is greater recognition by the people, business people in particular, that something must be done to get movement going again. Despite the fact considerable efforts have been made so far in this regard, we need to renew our efforts. It is for this reason I am asking the Minister of State to consider carefully how it might be possible for his Department to intervene in a positive way to nudge the powers that be in the direction required to bring about a restoration of activity and bring to an end this blight that has befallen the town of Naas, the leading provincial town of County Kildare, which is bedevilled by the impact of the downturn in the economy, as symbolised by the immobilised cranes. I appeal to the Minister of State to do his utmost to contact all the bodies concerned with a view to bringing procedures to a satisfactory conclusion.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-05-31 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the town centre development in Naas. I am familiar with this issue as I saw it raised in a television programme. I understand the Deputy's concerns and the importance of moving forward on the issue for the benefit of the community of Naas. The Deputy has set out a view of Naas that people would like to see changed to make it a progressive and developing town. The proposed development is, unfortunately, one of the casualties of the recent economic recession in that it was proposed to commence at the wrong time, just as the economy went into decline in the late 2000s. As a consequence, it has been stalled since. This is a shame because as it is a town centre and it should be developed before areas outside the town are developed. Numerous other developments of this nature, as well as town centre areas, were similarly affected by the decline in economic activity over the past decade. This is one of the many legacy issues we as a country have had to face arising from the economic collapse of the late 2000s from which we are only now beginning to recover. I am informed by Kildare County Council that the securing of a satisfactory conclusion to the development of the Naas town centre site is a priority issue for the council and that the progression and reactivation of the development has been a particular focus of its efforts over recent years, this with a view to assisting in the revitalisation of the central part of Naas, the main town in County Kildare. The Department has also been keen to see that development. The Deputy is correct that there is interest on all sides in the development, but we need to find some way to make it happen. I will use whatever powers I can to help on this issue and to try to move the project along. I do not have a direct role, but I will try to do what I can. In this regard, the council has advised that on foot of arbitration procedures, it recently successfully completed an agreement with one of two site owners relating to the provision of roads infrastructure to service the town centre site. The arbitration case relating to the second site owner remains to be heard by the property arbitrator, but I understand that the hearing in this case is delayed due to the property arbitrator's current caseload. We will look to see what we can do to make progress in this regard because the long delay is unsatisfactory. The remainder of the stalled town centre development in Naas is in NAMA, but I understand that the council, in parallel with the arbitration proceedings, has been engaged in ongoing discussions with relevant parties with a view to advancing development of the site at the earliest possible date. I should point out that my role as Minister of State in regard to planning and development generally is to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework as required, including in regard to national urban policy. In this context, numerous measures were initiated by the previous Government to assist in the rejuvenation of town centre areas and to help businesses located there. Such measures included reduced contribution levies for town centre developments, assistance with rates, and efforts to promote and support, through the new planning guidelines, the vitality and viability of city and town centres. In this respect, I will use whatever powers I have in my new role to try to help progress this development. We will consider additional input if necessary as this is an issue that needs to be progressed. I do not have a direct role in regard to the progression of individual sites, but in general we need to see this happen. I will certainly help where I can. The Department is keen to see progress and has been working with the council to try to make this happen. We will continue to communicate on that and will try to give it a push forward. It is hoped we will have some success.

I am glad to see the Minister is here and I thank him for attending in person. I am using this opportunity as a chance for discussion. As a former Minister, I have a high regard for the Department and feel that getting the proper name for it is important. Discussion on this issue will be framed by comments made by the Taoiseach earlier today. He said we could get obsessed by words, but it is actions we need to account for. However, we should also be aware of what people in the environmental community are saying, that there is not a government in western Europe or the western developed world that does not have an environment Ministry. This says something to us. While we need action more than words, perhaps getting the words right at the start would help the Minister in terms of the actions he must take. The Minister may have some freedom in regard to a name, as according to what the Taoiseach said today, the name for the Department has not been finally decided so there is still room to manoeuvre. I suggest therefore that the Minister should consider as a title for the Department, the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Communications. I will outline why this makes sense. It is important we keep communications, energy and the core of the Department together. There is a real strategic interest in this regard and I am glad the Government has not changed that. There is a real strategic interest in having the digital technology revolution industry in the same location as where we will have the regulation of the clean energy revolution and the efficiency revolution that needs to take place. The two are similar in a variety of ways. Huge investment and innovation is taking place. The areas are similarly regulated and there is a mixture of both State and market interest. Therefore, it makes sense.That is and should be the core of the Department. Indeed, it should be the core of economic development for any Government because that is where the opportunities and the jobs are as well as the solutions to climate change and the other environmental problems we face. It is important that we keep communications within the Department and that we see that as a natural synergy which will regulate the Internet revolution that is taking place as well as the clean energy revolution. It is good for us to cite climate change in the title to indicate that we will lead on this issue. We are not doing that at present, so it is a statement of intent that we will lift the level of effort, ambition and action on the climate change issue and in our energy portfolio. The Minister has a key position. I used to joke with a former colleague, the then Minister for the Environment, by asking him to step aside because it was time for the professionals to get involved and for energy Ministers to provide the solution. This was true at the time but energy in response to climate change defines everything now. People talk about trialoguing whereby we had to get the three-way system of security, competitiveness and environment right but climate change trumps everything now and comes first in energy policy. One can get competitiveness and security in a variety of ways but we now must apply laws of physics in the energy sphere, so the energy portfolio is now the climate change portfolio. Why would we put the word "environment" here? It is difficult because environment has been split in three ways. Some has gone to the Department headed up by Deputy Heather Humphreys. In the days of Phil Hogan, he had the natural heritage side of the portfolio and, in his time, Deputy Simon Coveney had responsibility for water and other environmental services. With the movement of climate change across to this Department and the management of waste, air quality and the EPA, this is also the home of environment.  The reason I suggest the Minister takes this title is to grab the power and grow the Department, to strengthen it and empower it within Government. By giving it the title, the Minister is saying to Deputy Simon Coveney that he has to follow and that planning, development and housing have to fit into the big environmental picture of what we are doing in respect of the climate. It recognises that the ability to solve climate change issues and to tackle our environmental problems come from our communications and energy industries. The Minister putting his Department as the lead Department for the environment strengthens his case in Cabinet and strengthens what we need to do across agencies in the State, in the public service and elsewhere. It is not guaranteed to work. In the UK, the creation of a climate change and energy ministry has not effectively taken any power back from the Treasury and there are other examples in other countries. However, for our country, I advocate the Minister bringing back the word "environment" into the title and combining it with climate change and communications. This would make a good fit for the Department he is now lucky to lead.

As he is aware, a range of functions currently undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will transfer into this Department in the coming weeks. The Department will be renamed the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment when the transfer of functions is completed. I agree with everything Deputy Ryan said apart from the fact that he said every developed country had a Department of the Environment. That it is not true, as Hungary does not have a Department of the Environment. It is something I have been looking into and I believe it is very important that "environment" is in the title of the new Department. Following the Taoiseach's announcement, in addition to the current functions, my Department will also assume responsibility for the following sections from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government: environment policy and awareness; climate policy section; EU and international environmental policy; waste policy and resource efficiency; and the air quality and environmental radiation policy environment advisory unit. There are clear synergies between the existing energy responsibilities and those of the functions which are due to transfer from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. It was a great honour to receive my seal of office as the first Minister in the history of the State to have overall responsibility and the title for action on climate. The Government, in both its climate policy in the programme for partnership Government and the recent White Paper on energy, has committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy by 2050. In December, we had the Paris Agreement, which has recently been ratified and cements the EU's contribution to the international effort to address climate change. Central to this is the decarbonisation of the entire energy system, covering electricity, heat and transport. The transfer of the environment function into a reconstituted Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment allows the synergies between climate and sustainable energy policy to be fully realised. It brings a coherence across the various policy areas involved and will ensure that Ireland addresses the challenges in ways that are technically feasible, cost effective and fair in terms of Ireland's contribution to the overall EU ambition. As part of the transfer of the environment functions, air quality policy is also moving, which affords the opportunity to fully integrate energy decarbonisation with the attendant air quality implications. This will ensure no inadvertent adverse impacts from the decarbonisation efforts. In relation to the communications element of the portfolio, my Department will continue with the procurement process for the national broadband plan. I am in discussions with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on the detailed arrangements to give effect to commitments in the programme for a partnership Government regarding her Department's role in relation to the roll-out phase of the national broadband plan. That role will include leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband task forces and working with local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract or contracts has been awarded. The Department headed up by Deputy Heather Humphreys will also assume responsibility for the post office network. In essence, the key aim of Government in amalgamating the environment functions currently undertaken by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with the energy portfolio of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is to put in place the best structures and arrangements to enable us to transition to a low carbon economy and meet our international obligations on climate change. The Department will continue to strive to protect Ireland's energy supply, generation, security, affordability and sustainability and to ensure that Ireland complies with international energy and climate change policies.
