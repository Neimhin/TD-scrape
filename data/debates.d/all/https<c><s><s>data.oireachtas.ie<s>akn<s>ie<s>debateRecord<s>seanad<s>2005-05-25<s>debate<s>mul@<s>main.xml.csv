I have selected those matters raised by Senators White, Brennan and Dooley and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Morrissey, Ulick Burke, Bannon, McHugh, Coghlan and Terry may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Yesterday, Senator O'Meara raised the "Prime Time" programme on Monday evening about the tax exiles who pay no tax in this country. The Taoiseach said in the Dáil yesterday that the entire scheme was being reviewed but he said that two years ago. Has the Leader any information as to when that review might be completed? This amendment to the Finance Act occurred when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance in 1994.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Which scheme is this?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Tax breaks for non-residents who are out of the country for more than 183 days in the year — a commitment was given that it would be reviewed.Most ordinary taxpayers are disgusted that a certain golden brigade can get away without paying any tax when most compliant taxpayers do their bit. The Government argues that if we get rid of this amendment to the Finance Act, significant people, in the Taoiseach's own words, will fly from the country. So be it. If they head off, we will be grand without them. A large group of significant people remain here, God help and protect them, one of them being the CEO of a large airline who manages to get by living here 12 months of the year. If the others head off into the sun, let them do so. Why is the Government so intent on protecting these people? Will the Leader find out from the Government when the review of the scheme will be completed?No. 13 on the Order Paper is statements on planning. Apartment building represents a major component of the total housing output but there are serious question marks over the standard of design and building in them. Many of them are no better than shoeboxes built on top of each other. I, along with other Senators, came across the case whereby a local authority in Dublin amended its development plan to ensure higher standards and better living conditions for apartment buyers. However, it has found that the Government has not put guidelines in place for the design and the standards of apartments. This means that any builder can now take an action to An Bord Pleanála against a planning permission because there are no guidelines in place on a national basis. Will the Leader provide time for a debate on this issue when we can examine the issue of the standard and quality of apartment blocks, not just in Dublin city, but in all our urban centres?The Government has already produced guidelines on density, which will ratchet up the number of apartment blocks throughout Dublin city. I understand this is necessary for sustainability and transport. However, we must work hard at improving the standards of building and design of these new developments if we are serious about providing decent homes for people.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I could not agree more with Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of non-residents. I have raised it many times previously. The House should know the way those people living abroad are playing ducks and drakes with the scheme. If one flies into the country in one's private jet to do a day's business and then, like Cinderella, be out of the country by 12 o'clock, it is not counted as a day for purposes of the scheme. One could easily commute in and out of the country on that basis. This is appalling and gives a bad impression about our tax system and the way it treats the wealthy.The last time I raised this issue, I got two different reactions. I got a stiff reaction from a well-known exile, a non-resident who took grave exception to what I said even though he could disagree with none of it. I also received letters from the chief executive officers of six publicly-listed companies, thanking me for raising the issue. They said they were sick and tired of seeing these heroes, who do not pay their taxes in Ireland, playing ducks and drakes with the system and that it should be changed. I often criticise Michael O'Leary but I always add the rider that at least he pays his taxes in this country.Rugadh agus tógadh mise i gCorca Dhuibhne agus chuaigh mé ar scoil le muintir na Gaeltachta agus na Galltachta. Bhí sean-eolas againn ar ár ndúiche féin. I cannot find any person from the Gaeltacht or Galltacht of west Kerry who agrees with the daft proposal to change the name of Dingle to An Daingean. It is a form of cultural terrorism to pretend this does some good for the Irish language. Muintir na Gaeltachta believe this is an embarrassment with no sense in it. It is of no help or use to anybody and is counterproductive to the tourism business, the main industry in west Kerry. It only creates confusion and is the kind of daftness that embarrasses those of us who support and use the Irish language.The Government should do what every local authority does. If a placename is to be changed, a plebiscite of those living in the area is held. If the people want to change it, then it is changed. B'fhearr liom an focal "Daingean" go cinnte. However, I was born and reared in Dingle. That is the way it should stay. Will the Leader invite the Minister responsible to explain why this daft change is necessary?
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am pleased an inherent unfairness in our taxation system has been revealed. It has become the subject of general discussion in the House. Yesterday, I asked for a debate on the taxation system, specifically on the matters raised in Monday's "Prime Time" programme. The comments of my colleagues on this side of the House say it all. Why are some people facilitated by our laws — in particular those brought in by the Taoiseach when Minister for Finance — in not paying their fair share of tax and not making a contribution in this country, against the background of a promised review which has never taken place? We want to know why the review has not been undertaken or published.

Members should be aware that the Minister for Health and Children intends to implement the Hanly report, so that 26 general hospitals around the country will be downgraded.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I support Senator Brian Hayes in his call for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to return to this House and revisit the guidelines for residential development. I recently attended a meeting where there were complaints about the quality of apartment blocks, which are now of high density in less space, yet cost more. Local authorities work to different guidelines in this area, whereas there should be national guidelines. I spoke about this issue two weeks ago, and it should be revisited.

There is tremendous tension between unions and management in An Post. Postmen and other workers have had no pay increase since February 2003. They are not extremely well paid. While An Post points to the economic necessity of making profits, I ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to recognise the social dimension in An Post in the application of profit and loss accounting, and to ask ComReg to quantify that social dimension and give an appropriate recognition to An Post with regard to its role.I would like the Minister to focus on such issues. I am not sure that changing the postal codes and addresses will make a significant impact, other than involving a substantial financial cost. There are many more important issues for the Minister to tackle. Perhaps he might attend this House and allow us to discuss An Post and its services.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I join Senators Ormonde and Brian Hayes in calling for a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to developing standards in the building sector. I am concerned not only with apartment blocks in cities and towns, as there is a major problem with virtually all houses and apartment blocks currently being built. As a result of the construction industry boom, builders are moving to the next site before they properly finish the one on which they are working. Work of appallingly poor quality is being completed. The Government needs to review the building standards because a problem will arise within ten to 15 years. The current poor level of construction will lead to great difficulties with regard to maintaining property at a later stage.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank the Leader for arranging a debate on Iraq, which is timely. I agree with my colleague, Senator O'Toole, on the subject of Irish placenames. I too love the Irish language. I do not have Senator O'Toole's facility with the language but I occasionally try to use it. Nobody uses names such as Ceannanas Mór, Ráth Luirc and Cúl an tSúdaire for Kells, Charleville and Portarlington. People have the right to name their own places rather than being bullied by some nit-wit in Dublin.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I withdraw both terms.We need to examine the tax break situation. Some of the incentive schemes are very good. I am delighted that Cork has acquired a wonderful early 19th century view of the city, which was made possible by tax incentives. However, it is obscene that people who make enormous amounts of money, some of the wealthiest people in the country, pay no tax whatsoever, while simultaneously we see elderly people being pursued by the Revenue Commissioners because they put money into pension schemes 20 years ago. There is a sharp contrast in that scenario.I ask for a debate on junk mail. There should be a ban on unsolicited material being pushed through people's hall doors. Under the Data Protection Act, an individual can opt out of receiving such material. We should re-examine the legislation.

If one is away for a few days, one's letterbox is stuffed up and any passing thief knows well that the house is empty. Apart from that, it is an invasion of people's own space. Very often young lads are hired to deliver the leaflets, they want to get rid of them, so they shove 20 or 30 into each letterbox.

The recent "Prime Time" programme raised important issues. I took particular exception to the description by one individual of this country as "worse than communist China". The same individual made a profit of €250 million in two years from the sale of State assets and misled listeners to the "Pat Kenny Show" that he would pay €50 million in tax on that profit.

As Senator O'Toole has said, removing Dingle from all of the sign posts is slightly comical but mainly crazy. There is no support in the Gaeltacht, the Galltacht or County Kerry for this move. It is painting us as backward people. What is officialdom trying to do? Is it trying to hide the place from foreign tourists?

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the House and allow the people of Corca Dhuibhne and An Daingean to have a plebiscite on the matter.

Some of the tax breaks were introduced before 1994 and some were introduced after that. They have made a substantial difference to the economy. I come from a rural area in the north west and because of tax breaks, there is blood in the veins of rural areas. Now there are people living in rural areas, where previously they could not get work or have a house. It would be a bad idea to throw out the baby with the bath water. We do not want to do that ——

This corn is being forced into our food chain despite warnings that it harmed rats during trials. This is a matter of concern to us all. The results of the trials have alarmed the French commission on genetic engineering, German Government advisers and the British. I am concerned by the fact that the results of the trials are being kept secret by the EU food watchdog. It is important that we have a debate on the issue as soon as possible because the issue of GM foods and the manner in which it is handled in the European Union, America and other countries should be of concern to us all.

The unions include the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants, comprising principal and assistant principal officers. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the House to explain why while there is 11% growth in postal services in Italy and 8% in Finland, An Post has experienced a decrease of 1.3%? The management of An Post and the unions must work together to improve industrial relations and resolve their difficulties through dialogue rather than through the Labour Court.The report states that Ireland is the most dynamic country in Europe, it has the fastest growing population and, therefore, there should be a growth rather than decrease in postal services. The report confirms that the unions agree there must be a change in the overtime work culture of the company. I found the launch yesterday invigorating. We must get the Minister here to discuss the issue as some 13,000 are employed in An Post.

There are a number of reports on which the debate could focus. I would like the Minister to come to the House to speak on the matter. There is a report issued in Britain today that a large number of prisoners re-offend on release. I do not know what the Irish figures are, but we saw some encouraging figures recently which claimed that one system reduced the number of those who re-offend. I would like to return to that issue. It would be useful to have a debate on the Prison Service.

Tá an-chuid rudaí dearfacha ag tarlú i láthair na huaire agus ba chóir dúinn machnamh agus díospóireacht rialta a bheith againn maidir leis na rudaí sin.It would be helpful to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Éamon Ó Cuív, into the House to discuss aspects of the Irish language. So much is happening with regard to the language that we need an ongoing opportunity to debate the issue here. In my lifetime I have not seen so much official activity on the promotion of Irish, particularly in this House. We have a good record here and can take credit for much of the debate in the Oireachtas. I would not like to see a peripheral distraction introduced at this stage.We all agree that the Irish language is very descriptive. Senator Norris used the word "lúdramán" and I cannot think of any word that is more descriptive. I was impressed by the manner in which the word flowed from the Senator's tongue, like honey from a hive.

I would not like us to become distracted by this discussion. I agree with Senator O'Toole that the fundamental aspects of the Irish language issue are much more important. No Minister is more capable of arguing his case than the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I do not think any Minister is more sincere about the Irish language.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	51	That is right.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	52	We need to focus on the management companies which look after apartment blocks. Those who live in such apartments are facing a crisis at present. The concept of management companies is a new one for most people. That many people are failing to pay the necessary costs to such companies will have an enormous effect on the maintenance of apartments. If this problem is not tackled and legislation to deal with it is not enacted, there will be many tenement blocks in this country quite soon. I support the request for a debate on this matter.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I am sorry I am not a little taller, as then I could be called a "lanky lúdramán". This is an important issue. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should be asked to come to the House to discuss the new placenames regulations which have been introduced. We are supposed to have a bilingual policy in respect of placenames, but I do not think that is the case at present. I notice that officials have decided to change some Irish names. Plebiscites should be organised in such instances. The town of Gort in County Galway used to be known in Irish as "Gort Inse Guaire", but the reference to King Guaire has been removed from signposts. The Irish language form now used is "An Gort". People in many towns are annoyed about the watering down of the Irish language versions of placenames. Many of the amended placenames do not give the history of towns and villages. This aspect of the matter should be included in any debate.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Creidim go mór leis an méid atá ráite ag an Seanadóir O'Toole maidir leis na logainmneacha ar fud na tíre. If the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs comes to the House, we should ask him why he has insisted on imposing the new regulations on local authorities. I did not realise that one Minister can impose his particular wish on another Minister. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has insisted that local authorities, for which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible, should act immediately. The underlying level of vindictiveness is unbelievable.If the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, comes to the House, we should ask him to review the areas which are classified as Gaeltacht areas. Senator Kitt has mentioned the relevance of this issue to County Galway. If one is driving on the N18 from Tuam to Galway, one will see a big hoarding saying "An Ghaeltacht" when one is approximately 12 km from Galway. I do not think anyone will disagree with me when I say that one would not find a person who speaks Irish on a daily basis within ten miles of that sign. The Minister must review the boundaries. There has been controversy in this House about the election to Údarás na Gaeltachta of certain people who cannot speak a word of Irish.

The Minister behaves like that yet thinks he is doing some good for the Irish language. He has a lesson to learn. I hope the Minister will come to the House and speak realistically of what he is trying to do. If he is truthful, there will be many revelations on this issue.On another issue, I support Senator Brian Hayes's point. Members remember that in 2002 Sir Anthony O'Reilly declared in his daily newspaper that it was payback time.

Many football teams from Northern Ireland recently competed in the successful Setanta Cup. However, the match in Dublin last Saturday night was marred by violence because of a premeditated plan by people wearing Shamrock Rovers and Glasgow Celtic shirts. They wanted to cause trouble and had no right to be at the game. Is there a national hooligan register to deal with such young people?
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Some Members do not understand association football. This is a serious situation, which should not be laughed at.Of the Linfield supporters who travelled from Northern Ireland, one man was glassed in the face. If, for some reason, the hooligans and mindless thugs killed one of the supporters from Northern Ireland, would it not have serious repercussions for the Good Friday Agreement? The Minister should meet the Football Association of Ireland and the clubs to ensure this serious situation does not recur.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the review of taxation schemes. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, came to the House on the occasion of his first budget last year, he stated he was putting in place a review of all schemes. He stated he would have the outcome of that review before his next budget, which would be informed by the review.The situation is interesting because the original urban renewal scheme was introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition in 1985.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	72	We are not against that.

It was announced in the budget and the review will be reannounced before the next budget. He also raised the issue of new apartments, and I agree that many of them are little better than shoeboxes and that no guidelines have been issued. No. 13 on the Order Paper stands to be resumed and we can ask the relevant Minister to come to the House and address the issue of planning, which would be useful.Senator O'Toole talked about tax exiles who enter and exit the country before midnight. That issue is also in line for review. The Senator always mentions a particular aviation businessman who stays overnight in his bed in Ireland, which is good.

Tourists and domestic dwellers know it is Dingle.Senator O'Meara mentioned people who avoid taxation. She also said that the Minister for Health and Children, in a letter to a colleague, said that the report of the task force on medical staffing, previously called the Hanly report, will be implemented. This issue arose two weeks ago when the Minister was berated over decisions regarding capital expenditure. However, this is such a decision and I say good for her.

Senator Finucane mentioned the postal unions, the social dimension of An Post and the fact that workers have not received their incremental payments under Sustaining Progress. We will ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come to the House.Senator Dooley outlined the type of apartments being built at present. Senator Norris raised the matter of the immense amount of spam he receives in his letterbox. However, he can ask that it not come through. There might be four inserts in a newspaper on a Friday.

Senator Mansergh mentioned the various tax schemes and that the Minister is issuing his review before the end of the year. Senator Coghlan spoke about Dingle and its Irish name Daingean. Well done to the Senator on his knowledge of the Irish language. He described the present situation as farcical.Senator Scanlon reminded us that many of these tax breaks are the lifeblood of rural areas. Senator Bannon raised the issue of GM crops being used in our foods and recommended a debate on the matter. I agree it would be interesting.Senator White asked whether we remember her raising the issue of tax breaks with the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy. She then went on to speak about the launch by the four An Post unions and suggested that we invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come into the House, which we will do.Senator Quinn asked for a debate on the Prison Service. Senator Henry also wished for such a debate and we will try to find the time for that. Senator Ó Murchú asked that we invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and praised Senator Norris's use of Irish.Senator Terry also raised the issue of the construction of apartments and management companies. The older blocks of apartments have such management companies and I reside in one that was built in the 1960s. It is a fine size and is cared for by a management company. All of the residents go to the meetings, pay up and speak up.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	98	This does not work in the same way with regard to new apartment blocks.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The new apartments do not have such management companies, but the older blocks did and some of them still operate. It is a good point because one knows that the money is being spent on tending the grass, cleaning and painting, etc.Senator Kitt asked that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs be invited to the House to discuss the new placenames regulations. Senator Ulick Burke raised that issue also and asked for the matter to be clarified in respect of the Gaeltacht areas. He said the Minister had a lesson to learn in that regard. Senator Burke also mentioned a particular magnate and a headline about a particular election.Senator Feighan raised the tax exiles issue also. He also mentioned the Good Friday Agreement and cross-party and cross-Border co-operation. I agree that the disgraceful behaviour of fans at the match about which he spoke might be considered a breach of the Good Friday Agreement and that meetings should be held with the FAI to address that issue.On yesterday's Order of Business I referred to the Disability Bill. It is hoped the Bill will be introduced to the House on Tuesday evening. I wish to inform Senators also that it is intended to have a full debate on aviation next Tuesday afternoon.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the situation in Iraq. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the Seanad on recent developments in Iraq. I welcome the continuing interest of Senators in this important topic.The future of Iraq is a foreign policy issue of first importance to the international community as a whole, to the European Union and to Ireland. That is not only because of the security and humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, which deeply concern us all, but because after over 20 years of the most brutal dictatorship in Iraq the international community has the opportunity — indeed the moral obligation — to assist the Iraqi people make a better life for themselves in the wake of the terrible tragedies that have afflicted them over that period.The geographic location of Iraq, together with its natural resources and regional weight, mean that it will always be of importance to the wider world. Iraq has a large population, abundant water and agricultural land and very large oil and gas reserves, giving it advantages over some of its neighbours which the former regime was quick to abuse. Iraq lies close to very large oilfields in neighbouring countries and to the centres of conflict in the Middle East region. It straddles the divide between the Arab and non-Arab worlds and the borderlands of Sunni and Shia Islam and may well, in the foreseeable future, border the European Union itself.Under the Saddam Hussein dictatorship, Iraq was a force for instability in the region and a serial aggressor against its neighbours. It also engaged in gas and chemical warfare against its own people and against Iran, indiscriminate ballistic missile bombardments of cities, and ecological destruction intended to damage its perceived enemies.The stated objective of the European Union is to help in the establishment of a free, sovereign and democratic Iraq which can play a positive role in the region and that wider regional dimension should not be lost on Senators or Deputies. Achieving stability in this region is a vital concern to all of us in the international community who claim to play a part in this and who claim internationalist aspirations in our conduct.Recent developments in Iraq can be summed up as exhibiting two contradictory trends. On the one hand, there has been a period of unprecedented political activity, debate and movement. On the other however, there is no sign yet that the campaign of violence in some areas of Iraq is being brought under control. In some ways it seems to be worsening. It is in all our interests, and above all in the interests of the Iraqi people themselves, that the political process prevails over the cycle of violence. That imperative is the basis for the Government's policy on Iraq, which everyone can support regardless of the view they took of the war in Iraq. While the war caused major division in this House, the other House and throughout Ireland and Europe, those of us concerned with humanitarian issues and the geopolitical situation in that region in general now have an opportunity to unite in supporting Iraq so that stability can be re-established.The route map for the political process in Iraq was laid down in UN Security Council Resolution 1546 of June 2004, which united the international community in their approach to Iraq after the divisions occasioned by the war in 2003. That process began with the transfer of sovereignty to the interim Government of Iraq.For all of us, a particularly important milestone was reached with the elections held in January this year. For the first time ever Iraqis had the opportunity to freely choose their own rulers. Despite the violence in many parts of the country, the paucity of national media and the fact that almost all the political parties were newly established, the public across Iraq showed a keen interest in participating in the process. We saw many instances where voters had to brave real threats to their lives to exercise their vote and some voters, candidates and election workers were killed. No democrat could be indifferent to the sight of long queues of people braving these threats to cast their vote.The election delivered a substantial victory to the Unified Iraqi Coalition while the religious-oriented Shia coalition, backed by Ayatollah Sistani, won just over half the seats. There was also substantial representation for the secular Shia list of outgoing interim Prime Minister Allawi and for the Kurdish parties.Two factors of note are important for later developments. All of these blocs comprise coalitions of a large number of small and mostly new political parties. This has undoubtedly had an effect on political developments, in that a much larger number of players are involved in trying to reach consensus on key issues. The other crucial issue is that of Sunni representation. Due to violence concentrated in Sunni areas, and to a boycott of the elections by Sunni parties, the representation of the Sunni community in the transitional national assembly is very small, with only 17 seats where they might have gained 40 or 50 based on their percentage of the population, which is approximately 20%.This has produced a political need to ensure that the Sunni community is adequately involved in the political process, in the new Iraqi Government and in the drafting of the new constitution, which is a function of the new assembly. The Government, in statements and in replies to Dáil questions on Iraq, and the EU Council of Ministers in its references to the subject, have highlighted the importance of Sunni involvement. How this is to be achieved is, of course, a matter for Iraqis themselves. Without an electoral mandate, the real authority of individual Sunni leaders is unproven.Despite these difficulties, earlier this month we saw the transfer of power to the new transitional Government of Iraq under Mr. Jaafari. The advent of an elected Iraqi Government represents a real step forward. The new structures involve a sharing of the key posts. The Presidency Council includes a Kurdish President and Shia and Sunni Vice-Presidents. The Speaker of the Assembly is a Sunni, as are six Ministers, including the key post of defence.The challenges facing the new Government are great. Power-sharing between so many groups and creating a constitution are difficult enough tasks on their own, but the Government also has to try to overcome the serious violence that plagues the country and to rebuild the administration, economy and infrastructure damaged by three wars and a decade of isolation and sanctions. It will need, and is entitled to expect, the support of the international community.Many actors are involved in providing this support. The United Nations has been central to re-establishing international unity on how to proceed in Iraq. Its own involvement on the ground was greatly restricted following the attack in August 2003 on its Baghdad headquarters that killed many UN staff, including the Secretary General's special representative, Sergio de Mello. His successor, Ashraf Qazi, has been active in trying to involve Sunni groups in the political process.The UN has concentrated its assistance on support for the elections and the constitutional process. Ireland has contributed €500,000 to a fund to establish a dedicated UN protection force, which it is hoped will provide the security which will allow the UN to step up its involvement in Iraq. In my first few weeks in the Department of Foreign Affairs this funding was granted in response to a request from Kofi Annan, who visited Ireland in September 2004 and expressed concern at his ability to protect UN personnel. That meeting was attended by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and we agreed to assist in enhancing security around UN personnel in Iraq. This was in keeping with our commitment to support the central role played by the UN in all respects.Ireland's principal engagement with Iraq is as a member the EU. The EU is not involved in the provision of security in Iraq, although some member states contribute troops to the multinational force. The EU is committed to supporting the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq. The November 2004 European Council adopted a declaration on Iraq setting out a range of measures to assist this process. The EU has provided very substantial resources for reconstruction, and has given assistance to the Iraqi electoral commission in organising the elections. During 2005 the EU will, inter alia, continue financial support for reconstruction, conduct a police and rule-of-law training mission in Europe, offer expert assistance on the process of drafting the constitution, and assist in the organisation of the constitutional referendum and subsequent elections.The EU and the United States, at the request of the Iraqi Government, will host an international conference on Iraq in Brussels on 22 June. This will provide a further opportunity for the international community to demonstrate its support for the new Iraqi Government and for the tasks it faces. It will also enable Iraq to set out its priorities and plans for the work of reconstruction, as it is now for the Iraqi Government to take the lead role in directing these efforts. There is a Government in place, the fledgling democracy has taken root, and we must support that.In addition to Ireland's contribution to the EU effort, the Government has been active in providing bilateral assistance to Iraq. In 2003 the Government pledged up to €3 million in humanitarian and recovery assistance to Iraq, to be disbursed as circumstances allow. That was disbursed directly from the budget of Development Co-operation Ireland for emergency aid. To date, €1.5 million of this pledge has been delivered. A sum of €1 million has been contributed through the international reconstruction facility for Iraq to support UNICEF's primary education programme. A sum of €500,000 has also been delivered to the NGO Assisting Marsh Arabs and Refugees, AMAR, for health care programmes to assist the marsh Arab population of southern Iraq, who suffered considerably under the former regime. I do not have to recount the plight of these people under Saddam Hussein.The continuing security problems in Iraq have greatly slowed the pace of reconstruction projects there, and have curtailed the work of international bodies and NGOs, and hence the draw-down of pledged funding. We are ready to commit the balance of the pledged funding as suitable projects are identified.Due to the insurgency and continued violent rebel activities, there is a practical issue of dispersing the assistance we have pledged. Ireland's international reputation for pledging overseas aid and funds and for following through on these pledges is extremely strong relative to other countries. While there are a number of somewhat more unscrupulous countries in the world that are quick to pledge at international conferences and gatherings but never deliver on them, Ireland's record is regarded as being among the best. In this case, however, there are practical issues concerning the insurgents that make it difficult for us to disperse the total amounts allocated.There is no doubt that the continuing violence in Iraq has greatly hampered the efforts of the Iraqi people to rebuild the country. Infrastructural and other reconstruction projects are unable to proceed as contractors and their staff are attacked. As we have seen in the tragic case of Ms Margaret Hassan, even charity workers trying to improve the lives of the people can be targeted and murdered in a most horrible manner. In recent months, seemingly in response to the progress on the political front, the insurgency has demonstrated its continued ability to mount attacks in Baghdad and across a wide stretch of central Iraq.Analysis of the groups is sketchy but they seem to involve disaffected elements of the old regime, Iraqi nationalists reacting to the presence of foreign forces and Islamic radicals, many of whom are from other countries. This is a particularly reprehensible feature of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. These various strands are by no means of one mind in their motivation or objectives. As the political process develops, it may prove possible to convince some of them to renounce violence and to isolate the more hardline elements from their support. To what extent this is possible remains to be seen.In recent months, the insurgency has visibly changed focus from attacks on foreign forces to attacks on Iraqi people. This has included attacks on those trying to play a part in the rebuilding of their country through participation in the security forces or the administration. The aim of these attacks is clearly to prevent the Iraqi Government from establishing effective security forces of its own without the support of the multinational force currently in Iraq. Other attacks, notably massive bomb attacks on markets, mosques and other public places, seem clearly designed to cause maximum civilian casualties among the Shia and Kurdish communities to provoke them into a retaliation that may lead to intercommunal fighting and chaos. I unreservedly condemn those who perpetrate these types of attacks and who would seek to deny the right of the Iraqi people to decide their own destiny.All of us here share a deep concern for what is happening in Iraq, when every day seems to bring news of more appalling attacks. However, the vast majority of the Iraqi people and their representatives are struggling hard to rebuild their country and to enjoy a freedom they have never known. They deserve this chance and I hope Ireland will continue to play positive financial, political, diplomatic and other roles through the good offices of this House and its Members to support the Iraqi people in what must be a most forbidding challenge, namely, the establishment of a democracy in an ethnically diverse and geostrategically important country. We should support them because Iraq above all other countries deserves much support after the horrible tyranny inflicted on it by Saddam Hussein over the years and the regional instability this induced.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his measured and constructive contribution. As he is aware, this House has held quite a number of discussions and debates over the past few years on Iraq before, during and after the war. We have not discussed the issue in great detail since the January elections and it is appropriate we would do so now.I listened to the Minister of State's contribution with interest. As I have often said in this House, I was delighted to see the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. In the perfect world of ideal politics, the United Nations, other international agencies, the force of good or the force of politics in the region would have brought that cruel and inhumane regime to an end. Unfortunately, this was not to be and it took the invasion to bring to an end a regime that should have been ended two decades ago. We must recognise that politics and history move very quickly and we sometimes begin to forget who and what we were speaking about. Let us not forget that, since the time of Hitler and Stalin, only Pol Pot in Cambodia could compete with the awfulness of Saddam Hussein, a man who brought daily terror, fear, murder and mayhem to his country, people and neighbours. His regime used chemical weapons and slaughtered its own. We must agree that an Iraq free of Saddam Hussein is a good starting point.We must also agree that today's Iraq is a chaotic, unsettled and difficult place. The coalition invasion not only brought political and military difficulties but, from the point of view of the United States, it has been a PR disaster. There has been a great divide in the European Union as well as in the broader world as a result of the invasion, which opened a gulf between the US and the EU and between Britain and countries such as France and Germany. Politically, it is important that we try to heal these divisions. The starting point of this debate and, more importantly, of the long-suffering people of Iraq must be the post-election situation. People both inside and outside this House must reflect on the election in Iraq. That approximately 60% of Iraqis decided to vote is amazing. All indications in advance of the election were that fear, daily bombings and efforts to interrupt the election would result in only a tiny minority voting. However, for the first time in several generations, the people of Iraq had an opportunity to vote in a fair and free election.If we are to speak about trying to restore faith in the democratic process or politics, last January was a sign from Iraq that its people believe in politics and the political route. They overcame all sorts of obstacles to cast their ballots. There were attacks on election day. In Baghdad, a man with explosives strapped to his body killed six people in a queue at a polling station. Bombers killed four people at a voting centre in the Sadr City slums. A suicide bomber killed five people on a bus carrying voters south of Baghdad. The leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, claimed he would kill any "infidel" who voted. This highlights the obstacles people faced and decided to overcome. We owe it to the people of Iraq who were so brave and courageous in casting their ballots to ensure their votes work and make a difference.As the Minister of State said, the war and its aftermath have caused division in this House, in this country and in Europe. Where do we go from here? It is imperative that the UN and the EU play a hands-on role. I welcome what the Minister of State said about Irish participation in the political dialogue but it is important that there is a much greater level of UN and EU involvement. There was UN involvement and, to a lesser extent, EU involvement in the election process. The United Nations was a major player in helping to organise, conduct and oversee the election. It was difficult for personnel on the ground but perhaps it was the first sign that the UN was willing to play a more hands-on role in Iraq. In the run up to war, the position of the United States caused great difficulties at the United Nations and while those divisions will not be easily healed, we must go forward. If we can do anything to alleviate the daily suffering and chaos faced by the people of Iraq, we are morally obliged to do so. It is not enough to say that the situation is awful; we must ensure there is a political involvement by the European Union and the United Nations.There is much repair work to be done at UN level. The United States must be willing to accept that its decision to go to war without a UN mandate has caused profound difficulties for the United Nations. The sooner that is acknowledged, the better. The United States should face up, openly and transparently, to the issue of human rights abuses in Iraq. I would be the first to admit that no matter how bad the American human rights record is in Iraq, it does not compare to that of Saddam Hussein's regime. That is not good enough, however; we expect certain standards from the United States, yet those standards have certainly not been applied in Iraq.A report is due out today from Amnesty International, which will contain significant criticisms of the United States' human rights record, presumably in Iraq. We cannot avoid that issue. It is not good enough to see prisoners being mistreated, no matter what regime they represent or from what section they come. If we want to ensure that Iraq is not just a fair and free country but can also function as a democracy, we must set the highest possible standards. From what we know, the treatment of Iraqi prisoners of war and insurgents by the American authorities appears to have left much to be desired.Ireland has a special relationship with the United States, so we should put firmly on the record our belief that the same level of human rights must apply to everybody, whether they are in New York, Baghdad or elsewhere. America may wish to foster a spirit of freedom and democracy worldwide, but that cannot be done without having human rights at the top of the agenda. I hope that in the coming months, the American Administration will take seriously the question of redressing human rights difficulties.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	103	All we can do in this House is to state our firm political view that the United States must improve its human rights record in Iraq. That is one side of the story, but the other side is the ongoing campaign of terror and warfare being conducted in Iraq. The Minister of State pointed out, quite rightly, that there are three different groups involved — the Iraqi nationalists, elements of the old regime, and Islamic radicals and fundamentalists.The position of the Iraqi nationalists is understandable. They want a country devoid of foreign troops and foreign intervention at the earliest opportunity. The way to ensure that will happen is through the establishment of a proper political process in Iraq. We must all work towards that goal. The disaffected elements of the old regime have lost a lot and continue to have much more to lose. They hanker for the days of the old regime but they should understand that there will be no return to the past.The Islamic radicals and fundamentalists, however, are the people who concentrate our minds most profoundly because their project does not concern Iraq alone. The route map of Islamic fundamentalism is not simply about freeing Iraq of American troops — it is about a much greater and more profound attack on any civilisation that does not share its militant Islamic view of the world.It is important to state that there is no connection between Islamic fundamentalism and the millions of peace-loving, honourable, decent Muslims around the world. Many such Muslims in Europe have suffered greatly as a result of the attacks on 11 September 2001. To some extent, they have all fallen under a degree of suspicion, which is unfair. The vast majority of Muslims worldwide offers absolutely no support to the Islamic fundamentalist movement. The latter is as removed from the Muslim religion as extreme IRA elements are removed from the average Irish person.Nonetheless, Islamic fundamentalism requires serious political attention because that group has a political ambition to bring an end to western civilisation as we know it. That might not sound politically correct, but——

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I am looking forward to Senator Norris's explanation as to what radical Islamic fundamentalism is about. My clear understanding is that radical Islamic fundamentalism, which is totally removed from average Muslim thinking, is designed to bring an end to Western civilisation as we know it. Unfortunately, the current mix in Iraq of nationalists, supporters of the former regime and Islamic fundamentalists, is making the situation very difficult on the ground.The House has debated Iraq on quite a few occasions. That tragedy is unfolding before our eyes every day, but we must not allow it to disappear from the political radar screen. We have a responsibility to play a role in ensuring the maximum level of support for the new Iraqi Government through our international obligations to the European Union and the United Nations. When the House discussed Iraq over the past two years, it was in the context of support through the provision of food and medical supplies. Those needs have not abated and still require attention.The Minister of State should ensure that the Government does whatever it can at EU and UN level, using whatever resources are available, to bring some degree of solace to the people of Iraq until such time as they are entirely self-governing. The requisite solution will not be achieved until Iraq is policed by its own police force, defended by its own army and led by its own politicians. Slowly but surely there are positive moves in that direction but violence across the country must come to an end. We must have no truck with terrorism but, on the other hand, American forces, including the US army and political advisers, must examine the manner in which they are conducting security and political issues in Iraq.We expect high standards from the United States and we cannot accept lower standards of human rights being afforded to the people of Iraq. Over the course of the next few months, the American authorities must take human rights seriously and put them on the level that we expect in a western European country. The best way to showcase democracy is to ensure people in Iraq enjoy the same level of peace, security and human rights as we do. We must argue strongly with our friends in the United States that they must change the human rights regime in Iraq as soon as possible.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am aware of his commitment to foreign aid and much will be needed in this situation.We face a sad situation in Iraq. At the time of the invasion, Senators Norris and O'Rourke and I spoke against it, saying the war was both immoral and illegal. I said that not because I did not believe in the bringing down of Saddam Hussein, who had visited so much pain on his own people, but because war always brings many civilian casualties, with the concomitant problem of the destruction of infrastructure. I read yesterday that the number of civilians killed by military intervention in Iraq is between 21,000 and 24,735, although I do not know how they arrived at that precise figure.Iraq has suffered much. First it suffered under Saddam Hussein. We know what he did to his own people, particularly the Kurds. We also forget that the country was bombed almost daily for years after the Gulf war. Sanctions and misappropriations of funds resulted in the deaths of thousands of babies and young children. The invasion has caused thousands of civilian deaths and insurgent attacks are now multiplying. Daily we hear of the deaths of US soldiers and Iraqis as a result of car bombs, mortars and suicide bombs.May 2005 has been one of the deadliest months since the invasion in March 2003. In Baghdad, four US soldiers died on Tuesday in two separate attacks. Three were killed in the centre of the capital, where a bomb exploded as their convoy drove by, the fourth was shot dead 30 minutes later by a gunman in a passing car at an observation post on a vehicle. Another four US soldiers were killed on Monday in a bombing in Haswa, about 50 km south of Baghdad. The bloodiest attack hit a Shiite Turkmen neighbourhood in the northern town of Tal Afar late on Monday evening, when two suicide bombers drove into a crowd, killing at least 35 people. The double attack took place a few minutes after mortar bombs were fired at two houses in the Muallimin district of Tal Afar. People gathered at the bombing sites and 25 more people were wounded.Also on Monday, five people were killed and 19 wounded when the driver of a pick-up truck blew himself up outside the town hall in Tuz Kurmatu, near the northern oil centre of Kirkuk. South of the capital late on Monday, at least 11 people were killed, many of them children, when a car bomb exploded outside a Shiite prayer room in Mahmudiyah, inside the so called "triangle of death". Five civilians were shot dead in the same area on Tuesday near the Tigris valley town of Suwariyah. In Baghdad, 11 died and 100 were wounded on Monday as a mini-van packed with explosives was detonated outside a popular restaurant in a Shiite district. A parked car exploded near a police patrol on Tuesday, killing two and injuring eight.The bombers appear to have increased their attacks on Shiite neighbourhoods amid continuing resentment among the Sunni Arab former elite against the majority community's new empowerment. This recent wave of attacks in Iraq appears indicative of a new stage in the insurgency. Attacks on police and army recruitment centres illustrate the way in which the insurgents are targeting the most critical function of the new government — its ability to provide security. Attacks had increased in the run up to the 30 January election but then appeared to fall back slightly, although they were still at the same level as a year ago. There are now 400 attacks a week — this figure includes everything from major bomb blasts to smaller incidents with no casualties. We should try to realise the implications of these figures.A spate of attacks in the last two weeks, however, indicates that we may be encountering a new spike closely related to political manoeuvrings in Baghdad as insurgents try to destabilise the new government. We become inured to these figures after a while as they roll of the presses. We think of a car bomb where 30 people are killed and hope that it will eventually sort itself out. We must always remind ourselves of the tragedy, pain and suffering involved, with families ripped apart; it does not matter what nationality or religion they are.The sophistication and scale of some of the attacks appears to be increasing, including the use of tandem bombs, where a second bomb is timed to go off just as rescuers arrive to help those injured in the first bomb. Military style assaults have also taken place, such as that on Abu Ghraib prison.There is a continuing trend towards the targeting of ethnic communities, as witnessed by attacks on Kurds in Erbil and Tal Afar. This is a sign of the way in which politics and violence are closely intertwined in Iraq. While foreign fighters have often been the most visible of those involved in the insurgency due to their extreme methods, the bulk are thought to be former Ba'athists and from the Sunni community. The challenge now for Iraqis is to bring Sunnis, most of whom stayed away from the polls on 30 January, back into the political process.The signs, however, are not good. The new government, with its Shiite Prime Minister and Kurdish President, has struggled to draw in Sunni figures. With talk of further "de-Ba'athification", there is further alienation of Sunnis and undermining of attempts to reach out to tribal leaders and other figures of influence who could try to persuade the insurgents to stem the violence in favour of politics.The other key challenge for Iraq in trying to stymie the insurgency is to develop its own security forces. With a newly elected government at least partially in place, building up the ability of the new Iraqi forces remains the key determinant of how long the US and other coalition forces stay in Iraq. Establishing the real strength of these Iraqi forces is not easy, not least because the raw numbers are misleading. On 6 April 2005, the multinational command on Iraq reported that there were more than 150,000 men in the Iraqi military, security and police forces. Recently, however, the Pentagon had to lower its estimate for the number of Iraqi security forces because the US had been counting police and soldiers who were technically on the payroll rather than those who were reporting for duty and had been counting those who were not fully equipped.The repeated attacks on recruitment centres are clearly an attempt to undermine morale and recruitment, as well as the ability of the security forces to combat the insurgency. Most of the national guard is still too lightly equipped and trained to perform more than limited security missions. Even if the numbers are at last picking up, the capabilities are a long way from matching those of the multinational coalition. The key point as people talk about early exit strategies and time lines for US withdrawal is that creating Iraqi forces does not make them combat effective or capable of ending crime.The attacks may also increase pressure from the Kurdish and Shia communities to use their own well trained militias to put down the insurgency. The fear is that sending Kurdish troops into predominantly Sunni towns may further inflame sectarian tension. The January election was a success but the challenge was to build on it, establish the country in the long term and quell the insurgency. This challenge still remains. Several months since the election, many ministries have yet to be filled. The problem has been trying to strike an acceptable balance of power between the different national groupings.Iraq's once dominant Sunni Arabs, who only constitute 20% of the population, largely boycotted the elections or were scared of voting. Now they have only 6% of seats in the new National Assembly. Shia Muslim and Kurdish parties have realised credible Sunni Arabs must be included in the new Government if the insurgency is to be undermined. It has been difficult to find Sunni candidates acceptable to all sides. For example, the Sunnis say they offered up to 22 candidates for the defence ministry but all were turned down. Shias and Kurds are reluctant to endorse candidates who served in the former regime and are suspected of having blood on their hands. Sunnis complain that the policy of "de-Ba'athification" risks turning into an all-out Sunni purge. Some argue that given Iraq's dark history of dictatorship and war, there were bound to be birthing pains in forming a representative government. However, those commentators will be disappointed that several months after the elections, problems still exist. Weeks of wrangling mean weeks of delay in confronting the large economic, security and political challenges facing Iraq. Political stagnation risks increasing the appeal of the resistance. Meanwhile the clock is ticking for the Iraqi Government to draft a permanent constitution.The delays in forming the new government played into the hands of the insurgents, many of whom are clearly determined to destabilise it. The announcement of the new Cabinet on 28 April heralded a fresh wave of attacks. It is less clear that the formation of inclusive government can draw the sting from the insurgency. One element of the insurgency may be remnants of the former Ba'athist Government that may be placated by Sunni representation in the new Government. However, the insurgency is thought to be a loose collection of disparate forces including Islamists, Iraqi nationalists, foreign jihadists and left-wing groups. Supporters of these groups may be more difficult to win over.Most of Iraq's neighbours have urged an end to the violence. However, some may have mixed feelings for the political process. While Shia-controlled Iran has been happy to see Iraq's natural Shia majority come to the fore, Turkey is anxious about the burgeoning Kurdish role and the risk that a war-torn state could break up leaving an independent Kurdish state on its borders. Saudi Arabia may be concerned by the effect the new potency Iraq's Shias could have on its mostly Shia eastern province.The US claims its presence in Iraq is limited to leadership of the multinational peacekeeping force and its large embassy in Baghdad. However, few Iraqis believe that Washington has given up its political influence. The creation of the interim constitution now guiding the political process which maximises the clout of minority groupings in Iraq, including the more US-friendly Kurds, was done under the auspices of the US. Meanwhile, there is no sign of an agreed timetable for the withdrawal of US troops, although it was the second point in the United Arab Alliance's manifesto. This group was the winner of January's election. The US President, Mr. Bush, has indicated that US troops are in Iraq for the long haul and several permanent US military bases are under construction there.In many areas of Iraq, reconstruction has stalled. The wars, the sanctions and the looting have left Iraq's infrastructure in ruins. In 2003, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the World Bank stated that Iraq required $36 billion for reconstruction. The US authorities in Baghdad added another $19 billion to the estimate to cover security and the oil industry. International donors pledged to contribute €32 billion to reconstruction, with over half pledged by the US. By September 2004, only $2.5 billion had been released, largely because the security situation did not allow rebuilding work to proceed. Over half of the $1.2 billion released by the US was spent on security-related measures. The reconstruction effort has been hit by allegations of mismanagement and Iraqi oil revenue unaccounted for.An Internet website gives the cost of the war in Iraq. While it is changed every few seconds, the last time I checked it stood at $171,983,948. This would have funded anti-global hunger efforts for seven years. It would have funded a worldwide AIDS programme for 17 years. We could have ensured that every child in the world has basic immunisations for 57 years for the amount spent on this unnecessary war. The Vietnam war is known there as the "American war". Up to 3 million Vietnamese were killed and much of the country defoliated. With Iraq, we are now in another Vietnam.

The troops could be there for years only to suddenly pull out, leaving the country in a civil war situation. War, except in very limited circumstances, does not work, particularly when a people do not want a foreign army in their country.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and thank him for his introductory remarks. It is a pleasure to follow the civilised and humane contribution of Senator Lydon, who went straight to the heart of the matter of the impact on the lives of ordinary decent Iraqis. They are trying to live out their little lives, keep their families together, educate their children and feed themselves. The intervention of the US by its invasion and war of terror has been a catastrophe for them.The Minister of State spoke of assisting the Iraqi people to make a better life for themselves. Electricity provision and water resources are worse than under Saddam Hussein. The civilian casualty rate is enormous. It has been estimated by a reputable American academic study that as a consequence of the war, there were over 100,000 direct and indirect military casualties. This figure is unchallengeable. One of the most sinister aspects of the American attitude to this is that it makes no attempt to report the number of casualties, especially civilian ones. We do not know what went on in Falluja.The war was supposed to make matters better. Has it? The situation in Iraq is widely regarded by the most reputable international commentators as an economic catastrophe. Living standards are declining with an increase in poverty, child malnutrition and a 65% unemployment rate. The World Food Programme suggests that one in four Iraqis have to survive on food rations distributed by the ministry of trade, while 2.6 million Iraqis are estimated to be so poor that they regularly sell a portion of their rations to meet other needs. A newspaper reported last week that some Iraqis have resorted to selling their organs, such as kidneys, to survive. This is what we have inflicted on them.I was one of the few people who protested against the Iran-Iraq war and objected to Ireland selling beef to Iraq at the time. I protested at the events at Halabja and when Mr. Rumsfeld was happy to give another hug to Saddam Hussein. Some companies close to the US Administration, such as Halliburton, have produced new water purification plants. However, they have handed them over to untrained Iraqi workers with the result that water purity standards have gone adrift.The Minister of State was correct on Saddam Hussein's regime. It was an evil and dreadful regime which engaged in gas and chemical warfare, indiscriminate ballistic missile bombardment of cities and ecological destruction intended to damage its perceived enemies. Does that not sound a little like the American position? Is this not what they have done? Do Members recall the so-called "shock and awe" campaign, involving the obscene fireworks displays we were treated to every night on television? Mention was made of Vietnam. What about the defoliants possibly used in Iraq?The Minister of State says that we all hope the political process will prevail over violence. Quite so, but the Americans tried to make sure that would not happen. There was an opportunity to negotiate and there were arms inspectors in Iraq, but the Americans planned the outcome. Vice President Cheney and his cronies in Halliburton were planning the attack on Iraq well before 11 September, 2001, which provided a sort of fig leaf. Elections were also held, but the Minister of State knows as well as I do that most people hold that elections held in an occupied territory by an invading army are always suspect.Let us consider the man the Iraqi elections threw up as President, Mr. Talabani, who has revolved so often that he is the whirling dervish of Iraqi politics. He has been in every conceivable party. He was a Marxist-Leninist at one stage, and a member of the PLO under George Habash. He is a complete opportunist. He has certain things in common with Mr. Rumsfeld. There is a photograph in circulation of Mr. Talibani kissing Saddam Hussein after an agreement in 1991, not very long after the poison gas attack on Halabja. There are quite widespread suspicions about many of these people.The Minister of State spoke of the international conference. I welcome that but the intention is to demonstrate support for the new Iraqi Government. I do not want something like that. Let us have a conference investigating the situation, one which lets us see what is going on in Iraq, and not a rubber stamp for American tyranny, which is what it is.What is this bleating about democracy? When did America welcome democracy? It did not do so in Chile, where it bumped off Allende. It did not welcome democracy in Nicaragua, where America subverted a democratic government. America likes planting democracy where it will cause trouble for Russia. In selected states around the Russian borders, America promotes what it describes as democracy, but that is done as an aggressive tactic, rather than in the interests of the people.I will quote some remarks by Halliburton executives and by people in the American Administration. "Iraq is the new Klondyke" is a very widely quoted phrase. "War is a growth opportunity" is a phrase which reflects the mentality, the psychology we are dealing with in the present American Administration.The word "insurgency" was also used in the speech by the Minister of State. That word is being used to discredit people who resist. Those people are part of a resistance. I do not always like their tactics, and I deplore the attacks on markets and mosques, but only 4.5% of operations conducted by this resistance hit civilian targets. That fact has been concealed. More than 95% of the attacks are directed against military targets, including the Americans, but the latter control the information in this regard. I deplore everything that negatively affects the civilian population of Iraq.Senator Bradford mentioned the Amnesty International report, which is important. I have a copy of the press release, though it was embargoed until 11 a.m. One of the main points it makes is that governments are betraying their human rights promises. It states:A new agenda is in the making, with the language of freedom and justice being used to pursue policies of fear and insecurity. This includes cynical attempts to redefine and sanitise torture.This is exactly what is happening under the American imperium.The events of 11 September 2001 have been used as an excuse, an alibi, to erode human rights all over the world, particularly in the United States and Britain. I feel very ashamed that anyone can use words like "democracy" in the same context when introducing torture practices not seen since the Gestapo. One such practice is "waterboarding" where, with doctors present, a person is tied to a board and drowned to the point of the lungs being about to burst, and then revived. This is what the Americans are doing.One must consider the use of language. In the run-up to the Nazi tyranny, the system of language went on the slide. That was done to prepare people for tyranny. The Amnesty International report tells of the attempts by the United States Administration to dilute the absolute ban on torture through new policies and quasi-management speak such as environmental manipulation, stress positions and sensory manipulation.The report left out the term "extraordinary rendition", in which this country is implicated through the use of Shannon Airport. This is a policy under which the United States Government, through its agencies such as the CIA, feels perfectly entitled to snatch the citizens of other countries, either in their own countries or elsewhere, and refer them to third locations, notably, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Afghanistan where they can be tortured, sometimes to death, in the presence of the CIA. Amnesty International noted one case of a man snatched in this way who disappeared in Syria. Nothing has been heard of him. I doubt very much if he is alive.What kind of democracy is this? Does this undermine democracy? Even from a practical point of view, a large section of the CIA is opposed to this practice because the information it squeezes out of people using these brutal, Nazi-style tactics, is so unreliable. It leads the CIA off on wild goose chases. It is therefore counter-productive, though only in terms of information, because ultimately, this war is about money, power and oil. There is little doubt about that. The war is creating a huge cost, as several members have said, and has now cost as much as the Korean War.While framed against a battleship, President Bush told us the Iraqi war was over. That must be almost a year ago. Fighting in Iraq has been prolonged and intense, so the costs have continued to rise. US Congressman John Spratt said that fighting in Iraq is lasting longer and is more intense than anyone expected, and the cost of keeping troops in the theatre of operations is greater than anyone anticipated. So far, $192 billion has been approved by Congress for the war. Where is it going? It is going into the pockets of Mr. Cheney's friends in Halliburton andKellogg, Brown and Root. For five years, Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, the world's largest oil and gas company. He continues to receive deferred payments of $150,000 annually and holds shares in the company valued at $18 million, but there is no question of a conflict of interests. Under Mr. Cheney, in 2003 a secret task force in the Bush Administration picked Halliburton to receive a non-competitive contract for up to $7 billion to rebuild Iraq's oil operations. Why did Halliburton get special treatment? Could that have anything to do with Mr. Cheney?In the course of buying and transporting oil from Kuwait, Halliburton overcharged the American Government by $61 million. I am sure that many people remember the celebrated occasion when Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown and Root, overcharged the American Government $16 million for the feeding of the troops. Halliburton has become a sort of unofficial, unacknowledged arm of the American military establishment. This is exactly what a Republican American President, Eisenhower, warned against, namely, the intrusion of the military-industrial complex into the political arena. However, this is what has happened and it is very dangerous. Where does all of this come from? It is notable that Haliburton was one of the largest political contributors in the run-up to the elections in the United States. Naturally, it received a reward for this and views the opportunities in Iraq as a new Klondyke.A search committee was set up, under Mr. Cheney, to find a new vice-president and it suggested that the best new vice-president would be Mr. Cheney himself. That is most extraordinary. I cannot put on the record of the House the language used by one of his former colleagues when this fact was discovered.I am concerned about corruption and the level of inter-penetration between military and commercial enterprises. For example, a company called Free Market Global, an international company that trades in gas, petroleum and other resources, appointed General Tommy Franks, the US army commander, to its board last year. That should give cause for concern to anyone who poses as a democrat.There are many reasons to be worried. Mr. Cheney formed an interesting group which, in February 2001, prior to September 11, was already planning a merger of interests, or a "melding" as they described it. Those interests planning to attack Iraq and create regime change were to be melded with those interested in the takeover of certain international oil fields. Nobody should doubt that this was all in the pipeline before September 11.As far as September 11 is concerned, I agree it was a tragedy but one that needs to be kept in proportion. Approximately 3,000 people were killed and for those people and their families, it was dreadful. I will never forget the images of people falling out of skyscrapers, but what did they expect? The US cannot go around trampling on other people's rights, murdering half a million people in Kampuchea, devastating Vietnam, undermining every democratic regime that is viewed to be inimical to their interests and then expect people to do nothing.I do not believe there is an Islamic threat. The belief that civilisation will be wiped out by Islamic fundamentalists is hysterical. Our civilisation is most in danger from what is happening under the so-called coalition forces.We should look to George Galloway, who faced down the Senate inquiry. US Senators were using false documents and Mr. Galloway gave them their answer, beautifully, in the Senate. I was ashamed last Sunday to read an article by an ignorant, stupid reporter, who attacked Galloway and attempted to undermine him. She did not attack anything he said but rather his clothes, eating habits, sexual predilections and his sun tan. She did not contradict a single word he said.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the Minister and his officials. In comparison to three or six months ago, Iraq has drifted out of the headlines. Much of the news reporting now is of daily death tolls — 30 people were reported killed on Monday and 35 on Tuesday of this week. This is reminiscent of newscasts about Northern Ireland in the past. I welcome this discussion as an effort to ensure the same numbness does not develop towards casualties in Iraq as did towards those in Ireland.A brief review of past news reports can reveal much about the current situation in Iraq. In May of 2003 and 2004, various newspaper headlines read: "Mass grave found near Baghdad — Could hold the remains of 10,000"; "Foreign Secretary concedes hard evidence of weapons of mass destruction might never be found in Iraq"; "Military police question soldiers about photographs of alleged ‘torture' of Iraqi prisoners of war"; and "America and Britain layout blueprint for post-war Iraq in a draft resolution to UN Security Council". The issues at the centre of these headlines are also at the centre of our statements today, namely, the atrocities carried out under Saddam Hussein's regime, the doubt about the justification for war and divisions at the United Nations, the abuse of prisoners in military prisons and planning for post-war Iraq. I wish to deal with each of these briefly in turn.There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator who brought death and misery to thousands of people in Iraq. The world is better for the demise of his regime. Whatever about weapons of mass destruction, the evidence of his ruthlessness is available for all to behold. No dodgy dossier is needed to prove Saddam's sadism.To try to conciliate or bribe a potential aggressor by making concessions, frequently with implication of sacrifice of principles is something of which Europe has recent and painful memories. It is known as appeasement and it ended in disaster. Whatever the differing views in this House, I suspect none of us wishes we had pursued a course of appeasement rather than the one that has led us to where we are today.On the question of the justifications for war and division at the United Nations, I will make the following points. On 26 May 2004 we had a debate on the situation in the Middle East. When I spoke that day I recounted the words of Edmund Burke: "Never despair, but if you do, work in despair". The experience of the debacle surrounding Resolution 1441 led to despair, both in and with the United Nations. There was despair that UN resolutions, particularly those dealing with the Middle East, would no longer be taken seriously or, more important, be acted upon. In this regard, I welcome the confirmation from the United Nations that Syria has fully withdrawn its forces from Lebanon. This significant move follows a UN Security Council resolution passed last September and the assassination in Beirut, last February, of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. A United Nations verification team has concluded that Syrian troops and intelligence operatives have vacated all of Lebanon, including border areas. This is a very positive development for the region and for the United Nations.As a result of the divisions evident over Resolution 1441, a spotlight has shone on how the United Nations functions, which is a good development. However, we cannot generalise about the United Nations. It is a very large organisation, with many functions and operations. It deals with women's and children's rights, trade conventions and Security Council resolutions. As is the case with international law in general, the UN and its conventions work well in thousands of ways every day, without a hint of controversy. However, when these break down, they do so spectacularly and in full glare of the world's media spotlight. Notwithstanding this, we must pay great attention to the recent report by the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, particularly where it refers to the Security Council. The pre-Iraq debates over Resolution 1441 demonstrated that reform is necessary. Kofi Annan has urged UN members to bring into the decision-making process countries more representative of the broader membership, especially developing countries.That process should not impair the effectiveness of the Security Council but should increase its democratic and accountable nature. Kofi Annan has urged member states to consider two options, or any other viable proposals in terms of size and balance that have emerged in his review. The Secretary General's proposals include not just enlarging the Security Council, but also setting out rules on when it can authorise military force, and an agreed definition of terrorism.Ireland should lend its voice to calls for member states to agree to take a decision on these important issues before the summit in September 2005. It would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus, but if they are unable to reach consensus, this must not become an excuse for postponing action. Ireland must be to the fore in driving this agenda and reform at the United Nations.In this regard, I welcome the appointment by the UN Secretary General of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, as special envoy for UN reform. As the Minister has stated, the appointment is a measure of Ireland's long-standing commitment to the United Nations and of the esteem it enjoys in all sectors of the membership.The third of the four areas I would like to discuss today concerns the treatment of prisoners. It is ironic that on this day last year mobile phones fitted with digital cameras were, reportedly, banned in US army installations in Iraq, on the orders of the Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. Quoting a Pentagon source, newspapers said that the US Defence Department believed that some of the damning photos of US soldiers abusing Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad were taken with mobile phones. One must question the thoroughness with which this type of measure is applied by the US as only last week we saw the publication in a British tabloid newspaper of photographs showing Saddam Hussein in a less than flattering situation. The newspaper in question said the pictures were handed over by US sources who wanted to deal a body blow to the Iraqi resistance.Whatever the motives for the release of these photographs, we must question any contravention of the rights of prisoners and any violation of the Geneva Convention. No matter who the prisoner may be, it is a question of responsibility. In taking action, the United States, Britain and other so-called coalition forces, must live up to their responsibilities. Their major responsibility concerns planning for peace. Whatever doubts have been expressed about how the US planned for the war, there can be no misjudgment in the planning of the peace.A Balkanised Iraq at war with itself is in the interests of no-one, least of all the Iraqi people. Having taken on the responsibility of ousting Saddam Hussein, the US must now shoulder the responsibility for handing over sovereign power to the Iraqi people. Each step on that journey must be a step closer to that ultimate goal. In this the United States and its allies need our continued encouragement and support. January saw significant progress on that journey when 8.5 million Iraqis voted in elections to select the National Assembly. However, progress since has been painfully slow. Lest we forget, this is Iraq's first true experiment with a fully representative democracy.Just how representative the transitional Government is can be seen in the ethnic origins of its senior members. Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites are all represented, but it is to its Shia Prime Minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, that the Iraqi people and the international community will look for signs that a truly inclusive democracy is developing in Iraq. He needs and deserves our support and recognition. Never has that need been greater. Despite, or most likely because of, the success of the January election, the militants have stepped up their campaign, brutally killing some 620 people since Mr. al-Jaafari assumed office on 28 April.The militants realise with greater clarity than those of us cosseted thousands of miles away, that we have reached the endgame. On one side there is a prosperous united Iraq, a beacon of democracy in a region unfamiliar with that concept, and on the other there is an abyss into which the hopes, dreams and aspirations of ordinary, decent Iraqi men, women and children will plunge.I have seen in the Lebanon, and we have all seen in the Balkans, the results of the kind of civil war into which the militants are now trying to plunge Iraq. Sunni will fight Shiite, Kurd will fight Sunni and pro and anti-Government factions of all religions and creeds will fight each other. If coalition forces despair and withdraw from this spiralling violence, we will witness the break-up of Iraq with all that entails, namely, massacres, ethnic cleansing, refugees and starvation. All that will remain of a once proud nation will be a training ground and sanctuary for international terrorism. All the international community could do in such circumstances would be to throw a cordon sanitaire around the country and hope the cancer does not leach into surrounding countries.What can the Government and people of Ireland do to prevent this appalling vista? For a start, we must remind Britain and the United States of their international obligations. We must remind them that they cannot walk away until Iraq can properly support and protect itself and its citizens. We must also do what we can to see movement towards United Nations involvement in Iraq. Currently, this is clearly not possible. However, it would be beneficial if the British and Americans indicated and updated a timescale for moves towards such UN involvement.I would like, however, to sound a word of caution about UN deployment in Iraq. Whatever approach Ireland takes, we must support only phased and planned UN operations in Iraq. This is critical. We must not allow a situation where troops in blue helmets are left helpless in the face of atrocity. There must not be another Rwanda nor Srebrenica. Britain and America should urgently consult the United Nations about a timetable for UN involvement, but this should not mean that UN forces are deployed before the ground is suitably prepared for the task set. That is the only fair approach for the UN and for Iraq.The terrorist bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 forced the UN to wrestle with fundamental questions regarding security. The UN still plays an advisory and technical role and has reiterated its commitment to play a full part in the next stages of the transition to full self rule and democracy, including a referendum on a new constitution.We must continue to support the United Nations and the Secretary General on both reform of the UN and moves towards UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement in Iraq. It is only through such an approach that this country will usefully continue its proud history of promoting peace and security on the international stage. There is too much at stake for the international community, the Middle East and the Iraqi people to allow narrow arguments about the rights or wrongs of the 2003 invasion to cloud our judgment. We must do all we can to support the United Nations, the coalition and the transitional Government in their efforts to bring about a brighter future for the people of Iraq.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	112	It is obvious that I do not have the same insight into this issue as Senator Minihan. As it is not in my brief, I am not as informed about this matter as I would like to be when speaking in a debate of this nature. I agree with the request made during a previous debate for Members to be briefed in advance of debates of this kind. When I examined the website of the Scottish Parliament, I learned that MSPs are given briefing papers on legislation and other matters under debate. We need to examine that idea.I would like to make comments and ask some questions on foot of the Minister of State's speech and the contributions of other Senators. The conflict in Iraq is no longer at the centre of the media agenda. I welcome this debate, which has been requested by many Senators, because it is important that this issue be kept to the forefront. Events in Iraq and the Middle East as a whole are key to the peace of the entire world. I did not agree with the war in Iraq. It is not right for the Governments in the UK and the US to decide to change the regimes of other countries. It is important that they do not carry out such actions again in other parts of the world, but it is more likely that they will do so if the issue of Iraq fades into the background. In such circumstances, a new war may be upon us before we can do anything about it.It is important that countries like Ireland, on their own as well as at EU and UN levels, forcefully state they do not accept the recent behaviour of the UK and the US. We should demand that certain action is taken. Members will be aware from previous debates that my Labour Party colleagues and I did not agree with the war in Iraq. The war was started on a dishonest basis. I am unhappy with the UK's role in the war, especially the part played by its Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. He persistently said the war was necessary for reasons of disarmament, even though he knew it was being pursued to bring about regime change in Iraq. It is wrong for a democracy to set such an example as it conducts its business. The UK Administration debated whether it should do certain things, while at the same time being untruthful about why such actions were to be taken. It is totally unsatisfactory that such an example was set by a country that purports to want to deliver democracy to other parts of the world.Ireland should not have a subservient role in its dealings with the UK and the US. While Ireland should support such countries as best it can as a friend, it should make its feelings known when such countries are acting wrongly. It is an understatement to suggest that the Government should review the approach it is taking at Shannon Airport. I refer, for example, to the money it is spending to allow the US to use Irish airspace to carry out the kinds of activities which are being carried out in Iraq and other parts of the world.I did not agree with the war, as I thought the countries involved should have acted differently. They continue to act wrongly in respect of human rights. Having said that, we need to work on the basis of what has happened. Everything we do should be done because we want Iraq to succeed. Our goal should be to ensure that Iraq is democratic and peaceful. We should try to spread peace and democracy throughout the region as a whole, but not by acting as the UK and the US have acted to date. The UK and the US should undo the damage they have done. We need to demand they approach human rights issues in Iraq in a certain manner. I refer to the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, for example.The conditions in the Middle East as a whole are relevant to this debate. It is obvious that the behaviour of the UK and the US in Iraq will have a knock-on effect on the delivery of peace in other parts of the Middle East. Similarly, the development of the peace process in Palestine and Israel is important when considering the future of Iraq. Ireland should act as an honest broker in the peace process in Israel and Palestine. Just as Israel has acted badly in respect of the Palestinians, the Palestinians have acted badly in respect of Israel. We have to work with both sides. We should be forceful in our demands as we try to secure an appropriate outcome in the form of a two-state solution.The UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has not delivered what he thought he could deliver in Palestine and Israel. Progress has been made as a consequence of work on the ground in Palestine, rather than as a result of the actions of the UK and the US. The people of Palestine showed when they elected Mahmoud Abbas that they are looking for a peaceful solution. I think the Israelis want a peaceful solution as well. I do not necessarily agree with many of the actions of the Israeli Government, but I believe most Israelis would like to live in peace and to see the Palestinians treated better. We need to continue to put pressure on Mr. Blair and the US President, Mr. Bush, to deliver what needs to be delivered if Israel and Palestine are to be brought to the table and if there is to be a positive and progressive outcome.The Minister of State spoke about the recent elections in Iraq. I have heard little about the monitoring of the elections, particularly from an Irish point of view. What did Ireland do to help the implementation of the elections? Was the outcome of the elections representative of the way people voted? It is clear that the holding of elections represented progress, but this is not enough. We need to ascertain whether gaps still exist. What can be done to bring more people on board in Iraq in the future? Ireland must play a bigger role. Much more publicity was given to Ireland's role in elections which were held in other countries after wars in those countries had finished. I do not think the Minister of State gave much information about what Ireland did to ensure that the elections in Iraq were democratic, as far as possible. If the elections were not democratic, what can this country do to deliver more democracy and better election outcomes in Iraq in the future? We should ensure elections are held in more areas and more people get a chance to vote.There has not been a great deal of discussion of Ireland's role in UN peacekeeping missions in Iraq. I appreciate Senator Minihan's argument that the Army should not get involved in Iraq if it does not know what it is getting into and what it can achieve. It is obvious that the safety of our troops should be paramount. We have had many debates on this issue, but little information has emerged about the discussions with various interested parties about Ireland's peacekeeping role. I have asked whether Ireland is offering any policing expertise in the region. We have a great deal of experience of giving advice about improvements in policing as part of our peacekeeping operations. Will we take any such action in this instance? I do not suggest that we should jump in straight away, but I am worried that very little information has been supplied. I have not been told what stage we are at in terms of those issues.I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to answer the questions I have asked in his response. I agree that the problems in Iraq should be kept on the agenda. Our ultimate goal should be a positive outcome. While it is right that we are critical, we should also try to make progress and work with everyone involved to improve the circumstances in Iraq and retrieve what can be retrieved. We do not want similar actions to those taken by the UK and the US to be taken in the future. Any future intervention in the affairs of another country should be done with the co-operation of the UN and the EU. The UK and the US cannot be allowed to behave as they have done in the past. Ireland should be strong and forceful in that regard.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Having listened to the debate for the past hour and a half, my mind is whirling in regard to how I feel about the points raised. The more one debates a subject, the more one can get confused. The question is how to get clarity from all the statements made.There has been no debate on Iraq in the House since the formation of the transitional Iraqi Government in January. Since then, I have asked myself what started this process. It started from the point at which there was a statement that we must invade Iraq to overthrow a sadist dictator and try to bring some form of democracy to that country. I absolutely agreed with that. When reading of what that dictator did in terms of gas and chemical warfare and putting fear into the citizens of Iraq through his treatment of them, one could only agree that he had to be taken out. I thought the only way to take him out was through the actions of the United States, which was the only country that could do that.However, since the invasion, I have come full circle in my thinking. While I agreed with the overthrow, I have since asked myself which was the better of two evils, given the current chaos in Iraq. The aggressors had a mindset which presumed all they had to do was go into Iraq to get rid of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi people would swoon around them. Perhaps there was an element of this in the initial phase, but the United States troops destroyed themselves in the process because they did not have a clue how to handle people. They had no proper training, only the example of the might and the power of a President who said: "We can do this. Go in there, take him out." However, they forgot they were dealing with a resilient nation, which is fundamental to the breakdown of the whole process.I have been shocked by the atrocities shown on television, including prisoners being decapitated and assassinated. The memory of those events rests with me. It must be asked why we, as human beings, have allowed ourselves to go that far. I blame the Americans, although it is awful to have to say this because I want to see democracy and stability in Iraq, as well as the reconstruction of infrastructure and health promotion programmes and the elimination of sanctions. I do not see any sign of these developments. Instead, I saw how soldiers treated Iraqi prisoners. How could that instill confidence in any European?I welcome that a transitional Government is now in place and that there is an attempt to bring the Sunnis onside and isolate the radicals, although I do not know whether this attempt will be successful. There is a need to bring in an international body and to exclude the Americans. The Americans should not be in charge of anything that involves the psychological dimension of how to bring people on board. They are too isolationist and aggressive. We should include the United Nations, which left Iraq after August 2003 when many of its officials were killed. It took a lot for the United Nations to re-enter the field of negotiations.An international body of people must come together on this issue, and Ireland should promote such a development. The Americans should not be involved in regard to any key area because they do not know how to handle such matters. They have alienated the Iraqis. There is no confidence in them and the result is chaos in Iraq. If such thinking could be brought to bear during the international conference that is supposed to begin in June, Ireland's role should be to help bring about a consensus.The Iraqi people are like the rest of us. I have seen many BBC programmes involving fine intellectuals, even Sunnis, radicals and fundamentalists who are not absolute isolationists, who are able to sit around the table and discuss the issues. There is a possibility for progress, but this requires getting the right people to negotiate in order to reflect Iraq as a body of people, not as groups of Sunnis, Shiites and fundamentalists. That remains a problem, despite the belief of the United States Government that all it had to do was snap its fingers and it would take over Iraq.Another issue that undermined confidence is whether the United States had another agenda, namely, the capture of Iraq's oil and gas fields rather than the attainment of freedom. If one begins to think like that, one will think that the almighty power is taking over.My short contribution is based on my thinking as an ordinary person, reflecting a dinner table discussion as to how we should move forward. In focusing clearly on the personalities who deal with Iraq, I plead with the Minister to get the Americans out of the negotiations. They will not get this right.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. We first debated this matter in May of last year and we should continue to do so to keep up-to-date, focus and undertake research in this area.CNN and Fox News broadcast a simplified version of the Iraq war as a war on terror whereas Senator Norris believes the war was about oil and money. An in-depth examination of any war will reveal multiple root causes rather than one simplistic cause; the same is the case for the war in Iraq. It is easy for organisations like CNN and Fox News to come up with a simplified focus because they want to ingrain a message in the subconscious of their audience, which they seem to have achieved in regard to the vast majority of the population in the United States.The multiple causes of war include ethnic-cultural, ideological, economic, territorial and environmental factors. We must keep an open mind as to what caused this war, as well as examining all the causes involved. This is especially so given the experience of war in this country. We should be mindful of the important point raised by Senator Minihan, namely, how numb we have become in regard to the news reports of war.Living in Donegal, I am often subjected to BBC and UTV news reports. On a daily basis throughout the 1980s, I was subjected to news reports about booby-trap bombs, incendiary devices and Protestants, Catholics and British soldiers being killed. To be honest, one develops an immunity to that type of news. There is a probably an explanation for this, although I do not know whether it is a natural human condition. As Senator Minihan explained, one becomes numb to certain news which is what happened to us in Ireland with regard to people being killed, bombed and shot. We took it for granted that this was a way of life and what we had to deal with. The same has happened with regard to the situation in Iraq in that it is no longer news. The entire world media was located in Iraq this time last year and right through the summer. Subsequently it focused on the US for the elections there, and then on the countries affected by the tsunami. The current media reports from Iraq are minimal and concerned with British and American soldiers being killed there. The coverage is maintained as low-key. It is important that we as legislators and politicians keep the debate going because we will not get transparent viewpoints if we rely on the world media.The Iraq war cannot be considered in isolation. We must look at the conflict in Afghanistan and the motivation of the US in that regard, which relates to Afghanistan's centrality. It is a strategic and central location of which the US is very mindful in terms of access to oil and gas reserves. I am not saying this on a whim, because evidence exists to support this assertion. In 1999 the US National Security Council noted:The United States will continue to have a vital interest in ensuring access to foreign oil supplies . . . we must continue to be mindful of the need for regional stability and security in key producing areas to ensure our access to, and the free flow of, these resources.Afghanistan is also part of the Iraqi debate. It posits the territorial argument as a cause of war and a fundamental part of the overall debate regarding the Middle and Far East. There is vital economic interest in respect of US companies building gas pipelines in Afghanistan. Legitimate trade is taking place in the central location of Afghanistan in terms of oil and gas supplies. However, Americans focus on the issue of illegitimate trade of narcotics and arms of which we must also be conscious.The situation in Iraq has generated much interest. The outcome of the American elections proves that Americans are divided on the issue. The same was proven in respect of the UK elections which showed the British are also divided. We are mature enough in that the debate has evolved and we are neither pro nor anti-American because America is split down the middle in terms of its opinion on Iraq. We meet US citizens all over the world and here in our own country. I have considerable contact with quite a number of Americans through politics and also with those who have come to live here. A large percentage of Americans are nomadic in nature. Many of those I meet are embarrassed by the situation in Iraq and by President George W. Bush. They refer to him as an idiot. On the other hand, there are people sitting in houses in Ohio who think he is a great man and world leader. This divided opinion was reflected in the votes.On the matter of oil reserves, in 1980 former US President Jimmy Carter declared that any attempt by hostile powers to cut off Persian Gulf oil supplies would be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the US. This relates to the environmental needs in respect of gas and oil supplies.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I thank the Acting Chairman for his intervention. I appreciate that he has much more experience than I in this regard. The situation in Iraq is serious, as is that in Northern Ireland. We have tried everything and are faced with a grave problem in Iraq. A solution will not be found overnight or in the short or medium term. We must weigh up every aspect and angle, including UN intervention. At the outset of this debate one year ago, my ambition was for the UN to be sent in and not the US. However, that might not have worked and the Iraqi people might have regarded the UN as an imperial power. We might have faced the same democratic deficit and war as is currently the case. Should we look at a UN composition of Muslims or one that reflects a broad range of Sunni and Shia Muslims and Kurds? We should consider every possible aspect in order to move the situation forward.Returning to the issue of Northern Ireland, we cannot get the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the UUP to sit around a table and form a power-sharing executive. However, we would regard ourselves in Northern Ireland as a more civilised environment than Iraq. The situation will not be resolved overnight and requires further debate and whatever intervention is necessary.We are currently faced with a capital imperialism, a contradictory fusion of the politics of state and empire and the molecular processes of capital accumulation in space and time. Many people advocate a debate on the major environmental and territorial causes of war. It is not a simple war on terror or one regarding oil and gas. Rather it is a question of resources. Michael T. Klare argues: "As shortages of critical materials rise in frequency and severity, the competition for access to the remaining supplies of these commodities will grow more intense". That is something on which the Minister of State might dwell.Population increase and economic development in different parts of the world mean that demand for resources is expanding at a faster rate than nature can accommodate. It is estimated that two thirds of the world's known petroleum reserves will be consumed in the next 20 years. The result will be temporary or chronic shortages in different parts of the world.War is not just about money or making a simplistic connection in terms of 11 September, Iraq and al-Qaeda. The causes are ethnic, cultural, ideological, environmental and economic. This is a major debate and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it. Long may the debate continue.

We must reflect on what has led us into this situation, even as we strive to get out of what can only be described as a mess. As time gives more perspective, I have a great deal of respect for President Bush Snr. during the first Iraq war when the objective was to get Iraq out of Kuwait, which it had unjustly invaded. He gave the United Nations full play, was seen to be very reluctant to go into Kuwait until the last possible moment and when he did go in, the troops stopped at a certain point.The Duke of Wellington once said that the art of life as well as of soldiering was to guess what was on the other side of the hill. In 1991, the Americans were very concerned about what would be on the other side of the hill if they went too far. Post-11 September, there was proper UN sanction for the Afghanistan situation. The Afghan Government was given various ultimatums. It did not abide by them but the international community accepted the justice of what was being done.Unfortunately, the invasion of Iraq fell into a different category. It was clear to thinking people at the time that, in terms of first principles, there was not an adequate justification for it. The case that Iraq was some imminent threat to the region and the world was faulty and defective, as we can see with complete clarity now. It was taken for reasons of geo-strategic thinking. I was sorry to see that it was invested in by Britain and presented as some kind of moral idealistic crusade. I do not believe there was much morality about it. It was simply a question of sticking with the Americans regardless of what happened.While the campaign over a few weeks was a complete success in military terms, what has existed since has been extraordinarily messy. That includes the deplorable lapse in standards in terms of treatment and keeping of prisoners, although one has to raise one's eyebrows more than a little that the only people seemingly being prosecuted and convicted of human rights abuse are women soldiers. Most of us would think they were very subordinate instruments, particularly when consideration is given to the Guantanamo Bay situation, which partly related to 11 September. People must follow principles of human rights and international law and not create extra legal zones. There is an attitude in America that if one has power, one should use it but the limitations of that approach have been very clear.The International Institute of Strategic Studies issued a report yesterday which stated that it will take at least five years before Iraqi forces are strong enough to impose law and order and that they were not even close to matching the insurgency. Our position in terms of principle are clear in that we have subscribed, along with other countries, to Resolution 1546 of the United Nations Security Council of 8 June 2005. Paragraph 15 of that resolution requests member states and international regional organisations to contribute assistance to the multinational force, including military forces, as agreed with the Government of Iraq, to help meet the needs of the Iraqi people for security and stability and humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.I do not understand the reason there is still an argument about the use of Shannon Airport in the light of that resolution. Whatever the argument prior to June 2004, it is clear that the UN, which is supposed to be our lone star as far as the conduct of international relations are concerned, asked us to give every assistance and we do not have any choice but to do that. We must recognise, however, that because of the intervention, on such dubious grounds, of the Americans and British in particular, any regime established by them, even though democratically elected, will have a difficult job establishing legitimacy, particularly as the Sunnis who were in dictatorial power for so many decades are now in a minority. One of the problems in that and many other parts of the world is that it is very difficult to get communities where there are majorities and minorities to agree to live under the one government. The fear of majority rule is intense.As far as Ireland is concerned, we have no choice, as the Minister of State outlined, but to play a constructive role through the European Union and the UN in trying to bring about a greater degree of stability. It is unlikely that this will be achieved by purely military means. There is a temptation to think that military power is a solution to all problems. It is not a solution to all problems, indeed it is not a solution to many problems. Long, patient political work is required.I hope one of the lessons we will learn from the past three years is that the western world does not get itself into this type of situation again. Of course tyrannies are unsatisfactory but if it were just a question of tyranny presumably the Americans would be making preparations to remove the governments in Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe and North Korea, but they are not doing so. The lesson is that the international community must work together. If a country's vital defence and national interest are at stake, as they were for the United States after the attack on 11 September, one can understand it may have to act in self-defence regardless of whether there is international support.That was not the situation in Iraq. The move into Iraq was discretionary and not essential or indispensable. Arguments are made about international law but it is not an exact science and people will argue until the end of time on whether the intervention was compatible with international law but what can be said with some certainty is that it was extremely dubious.We must use the little influence we have to ensure this type of approach is not adopted again because it creates a large mess. We must be as constructive as we can in trying to solve it and while I accept positives elements exist in principle, as if one could achieve democracy, stability and prosperity one will eventually attain a better world, I am afraid we are a long way from doing so.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I support the Minister of State's words on what Ireland can do to alleviate the situation in Iraq. It is not for me to go into the detail of what happened but it is well-established that action had to be taken to rid Iraq of SaddamHussein's tyranny. The action taken was justified and has been successful up to a point. It is important the international community finds ways to support the new Government so that law and order can be restored as quickly as possible. The situation is presently out of control and unless serious action is taken it is likely to drift into civil war.I will briefly refer to the issue of American planes going through Shannon Airport. I condemn the attacks made on the airport by a small minority of people who do not represent the views of the people of the Shannon region. This small minority engaged in criminality, breaking down perimeter fences, damaging planes and causing general mayhem in the vicinity of the airport. They had no local or national support. The successful policy on Shannon has been followed by successive Governments over a long number of years.The American authorities have nothing to fear from inspections on flights going through Shannon. American planes apply for permission through the diplomatic service to use the airport and in my opinion its position would be strengthened if it allowed the Irish airport authorities to inspect planes, especially in light of unsubstantiated claims made that prisoners were transported through the airport. It is important that American authorities take note of that and work with the Irish authorities to ensure that confidence is maintained in the airport.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter. Senator Daly clearly outlined the position on Shannon Airport and its role in this debate. For many years the Government has accommodated military aircraft from all jurisdictions, including the Russian Federation.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Is the Senator referring to Mr. Yeltsin?
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Notwithstanding that, a group of people have attempted to rewrite history and suggest the actions of the Government in recent years amounts to a departure from a long-standing policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a well-recognised fact that the Government has always allowed foreign military aircraft to pass through Irish airspace without compromising the military neutrality that still forms part of Government policy.It is disappointing that a few individuals have attempted to besmirch the good name of Shannon, particularly so for those of us from County Clare who must suffer an ongoing negative campaign around Shannon Airport. A perception exists outside of Ireland that some type of military operation occurs there daily. One would be forgiven for believing that a camp similar to that in Cuba is in place, which is not the case. It is damaging to the airport and it is important that we put on the record the assurance that Shannon Airport remains a commercial airport and operates on the basis of long-established Government policy.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I thank Senators for their contributions and I am particularly grateful for the contributions from the two Senators from County Clare, not least because one of the contributors, Senator Daly, is a former Cabinet member. He set out roundly and fairly the position on Shannon and there is no requirement for me to say anything further, other than that Shannon Airport will continue to remain open for business and open to US military traffic.On the issue of transport of prisoners, the United States recently reassured us that prisoners are not transported through Shannon Airport. The suggestion that prisoners going to or from Guantanamo Bay are transiting through Shannon is untrue. It is important we state that because the international media has repeated that rumour and it is not true.As many Government spokespersons and Members of this House stated at the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, the Government has not changed its policy on Shannon Airport in 40 years. Sometimes one is criticised for not changing policy for 40 years but the policy on Shannon is clear and has been continued by many Governments of different ideological complexions. We facilitate the passage of our friends from America through Shannon in military, commercial or civilian aircraft and there is no difficulty with that. It would not be wise to stop it. Germany and France were foremost opponents of the war in Iraq but they allowed flights through their airspace and airports. I thank the Senators from County Clare for their positive and helpful contributions on that matter.Senator Bradford opened this debate by discussing the threat of Islamic fundamentalism, and although other Senators differed and argued with him he is correct because it does pose a significant global challenge and threat. I had the occasion to visit the Darfur region in Sudan recently and one need only examine the situation there to see the effect of Islamic fundamentalism. The leading ideological and spiritual exponent of Islamic fundamentalism, Hassan al-Turabi, is under house arrest because he convinced the Government he led during the 1990s to host Osama bin Laden. We can all see the enormous consequences of that action for the Sudan, the Middle East and Iraq. Deputy Bradford encountered some hostility when he made that statement but he is correct and there is no point in pretending otherwise.Islamic fundamentalism also poses a threat and a challenge to many progressive Arab states and, in desperation, some have a process of prosecution and execution on conviction of fundamentalists. I do not agree with that. It causes a serious problem in the world in which we live.I admired the pacifism of Senator Lydon's contribution and Senator Norris referred to Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison. As the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development and human rights I reassure the House that I have raised these issues. The Government's position on Guantanamo Bay has been consistent, namely, that the Geneva Convention entitlements should be accorded to prisoners held there. The Government has expressed this in every international forum at which Ireland has been represented.We have seen graphic images of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib thanks to a particular female soldier who took photographs and the Taoiseach has made clear to President Bush our discomfort and annoyance at what is taking place. On the many occasions they have met, the Taoiseach has introduced the issue to their discussions and the position of the Government is clear where there is an abuse of human rights. In my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development and human rights I have had discussions with the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Dr. Kellenberger, in recent months.Senator Norris and other speakers raised the matter of ghost detention centres, some of which are thought to be in Jordan, Afghanistan and Syria. I have expressed grave concern at these centres, which are allegedly used for robust interrogation or torture. Although I raised the matter with Dr. Kellenberger, many of the discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross are confidential, as is proper. Dr.Kellenberger had strong discussions with members of the US Administration, including the President, Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney and informs me there have been positive developments on Guantanamo Bay. The International Committee of the Red Cross is the only international organisation that can get access to these facilities and it does so on the basis of confidentiality. Only on rare occasions does it enter the public sphere, unlike other NGOs. It honours and respects confidentiality in return for being granted access. Through my discussions in Geneva I am told the situation has improved somewhat and that the Red Cross is happy with the levels of co-operation and assistance received from the United States. That is of some reassurance on the matter, although it is not enough.Senator Minihan spoke of UN deployment in Iraq and although this sounds great the logistics of getting such a force must be examined. People should be aware that the US force currently in Iraq is a UN-mandated one. In a real sense it is not the same force that was there until recently. The UN mandate extends to the end of this year even though the force is not under the control of the UN. The US troops are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government, so it is a matter for that Government to decide whether the troops should be replaced by a UN force. It is questionable whether the UN could put together a force of sufficient size and magnitude to control a place like Iraq. This is neither practical nor possible; the UN only becomes involved if peacekeeping is needed. From the accounts of many Senators here and from the international media, robust enforcement is needed rather than peacekeeping.Senator Tuffy referred to election monitoring. Ireland is very active in funding election monitoring on a proactive basis and my Department funds this work. At the moment we have monitors in Lebanon and Ethiopia, and we have monitored elections in Mozambique in the past. Members are welcome to apply to monitor elections. We want to be more proactive in that area but we could not go to Iraq because there were no volunteers. It was too dangerous to monitor the elections there. At EU level we contributed by helping the electoral commission to conduct elections. That took place at a central level as it was far too dangerous to entertain the idea of people being active in the field. The jury is out on how reliable the election was but it succeeded in restoring some semblance of democracy.In conclusion I thank Senators Mansergh and McHugh for their contribution. I point out to Senator McHugh, a new, young Senator, that George Bush is not a man of low intelligence.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	139	This technical amendment is required to deal with the inclusion of a writ referred to as the "Statute of Winchester, observance in Ireland (1308)" in the Bill for repeal. This writ is a new addition to the list of Acts for repeal that have been classified traditionally as one of the pre-Union Irish statutes 1308-1800 in Part 1 of the Schedule. However, it is not entirely accurate to describe it as a statute and would have been misleading to include it therein. The Government's amendment addresses this anomaly by listing it specifically in the main text of the Bill.The method of extension by writ was used to apply some of the important enactments of Edward I's reign to Ireland. This 1308 writ was the first example of such when the Statute of Winchester was sent for observance in Ireland. The Statute of Winchester itself, an English statute, dates back to 1285. It is one of the statutes of the Parliament of England recommended for repeal in this Bill. As such, it is listed in Part 2 of the amended Schedule.The Statute of Winchester was a milestone in English law enforcement and was the only legislation relating to the policing of England for almost 600 years until the Metropolitan Police Act 1829. It recited that "robberies, homicides and burnings are more frequently committed than heretofore they were wont to be". It dealt with various matters such the opening and closing times of the gates of "great towns", the times of the "night watch" and the "hue and cry" that demanded that every citizen should assist the "sheriff" in the pursuit of an offender. In Ireland, the only remaining provision of the Statute of Winchester, dealing with fairs and markets in churchyards, is obsolete and is also being repealed.Referring back to the writ of 1308 to which this amendment relates, the writ would have been sent to the justiciar, reciting that the King was bound by oath to preserve peace in Ireland and commanding observance of "the statute lately published at Winchester, in all and singular its articles". Apparently, this writ was then read and publicly proclaimed "in cities, burghs, market towns and other places, as well within liberties as without". The writ was enrolled and set out in detail the lawless state of the Irish counties and commanded the justiciar that, with the Irish Council, he was to ordain and proclaim in the towns that the "hue and cry" was to be observed.When the various elements of these transactions are sorted out, it is clear that the Statute of Winchester was transmitted for observance in Ireland, that the actual terms of the statute were sent in transcript form and that detailed provisions about the method of proclamation and observance of the statute were made. However, to describe the writ as a statute and to include it within the Schedule to this Bill among the "Pre-Union Irish Statutes" would be misleading and, therefore, the Government amendment to section 1 specifically addresses this anomaly. It is a technical matter and I hope the House agrees with me.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The Government's second amendment merely inserts revised wording to improve the syntax of section 2(2) and addresses an anomaly pointed out by Senator Tuffy on Second Stage. The content of the subsection itself is a standard saving provision included in Statute Law Revision Bills and I will try to explain this in less technical terms.The Acts included for repeal in this Bill had many far-reaching legislative effects. They not only regulated law and order and the social mores of the previous generations, but Acts or statutes frequently contained many technical provisions dealing with the legislation itself or, in some instances, with previous legislation. For example, in an effort to provide certainty, provisions are sometimes drafted to confirm earlier legislation or the general understanding of existing legislation. These provisions almost always underwrite the status quo. They do not extend previous powers in any way or extend the existing law. These types of provisions are merely confirming in nature. The inclusion of section 2(2) in this Bill ensures that if any of the Acts it is listing for repeal had a similar confirming provision, then the repeal will not prevent the confirming provision from continuing to have effect. I hope my explanation is clear.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	160	This amendment brings us to the heart of the debate we had on Second Stage. Although this amendment is straightforward, its consequences are impressive. Government amendment No. 3 replaces the existing Schedule, containing 91 Acts, with a new Schedule, containing 218 Acts to be repealed.As Senators will recall from my Second Stage speech, that the initial research by the statute law revision unit, or SLRU, carried out during 2003 and 2004, focused on the source of legislation known as the Statutes Revised, to ascertain the extent to which the pre-1922 legislation was still in force in Ireland. As a result of this review, approximately 110 Acts were identified by the statute law revision unit to be in possible need of repeal, on the basis that they were in force, but on a preliminary view were not of practical utility.A public web-based consultation process was undertaken, which lasted several months. Departments were also supplied with a list of legislation relevant to their respective areas. They were asked for their opinion on the preliminary view formed by the SLRU regarding their suitability for repeal. The result of that exercise was the list of legislation set out in the original Schedule to this Act, which it is now proposed to replace through this amendment.Since the Bill was published on 25 November 2004, the Attorney General's office has continued its detailed research in order to effectively determine the exact status of each Act enacted prior to 1922. The Office of the Attorney General has been re-examining pre-Union Irish Statutes, and also the more comprehensive information resource known as the Statutes of the Realm, which now comprises the annual volumes of UK legislation. This contains the text of Acts that may have been repealed as to England, but are still in force in this jurisdiction.I would like to point out to the House that the public were once again made aware of this research and the wider Acts that had been identified for repeal, and consultations were held again with the relevant Departments. Tremendous work has been carried out in a brief period in order to identify the additional Acts now proposed for repeal.I will take Senators briefly through the Schedule, which is divided into four parts. Part I repeals the "Pre-Union Irish Statutes", which comprise statutes made by any Parliament sitting in Ireland between 1310 and 1800. Fortunately, a great deal of legislative spring cleaning has taken place concerning these statutes. A significant number of them have already been repealed by three previous Acts, namely, the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Acts of 1878 and 1879, and the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962.Part 2, in essence, contains two categories of statute, namely, Acts of the English Parliament passed before and after Poynings' Act of 1495. As Senators will see from the titles, much of this legislation dates from the 13th century and deals with matters relating to the Crown, felons, ancient customs and traditions, the administration of justice, religion, treason and excommunication, to name but a few. It is fascinating but certainly obsolete. In fact, much of it has already been repealed in England.Part 3 contains a number of Acts from the period following the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707. Legislation from 1707 onwards is referred to as British rather than English.Part 4 contains United Kingdom legislation from 1801 to 1922. During this period, sole legislative authority for Ireland was vested in the United Kingdom Parliament. The question as to whether any particular Act from this period applied to Ireland is not always easy to answer. Many Acts, especially in the Victorian era, expressly provided for their territorial application. In other cases, the application or otherwise to Ireland appears from the context. The research methodology used by the statute law revision unit in determining whether an Act was applicable to Ireland, was that unless it could clearly be said that an Act did not apply to Ireland, it should be considered as potentially applying and, therefore, could be considered for repeal.A considerable number of Acts are included for repeal in Part 4, with a great variety of subject matters, including trade, manufacturing, health and safety, finance, justice, defence and education. While they reflect the society they regulated, that society has long since been transformed.Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity today to deal with each individual one, but the Office of the Attorney General has kindly provided us with a brief synopsis of each of the 218 Acts listed for repeal in this revised Schedule. Clearly, the many additional Acts have simply served their purpose, not decades, but centuries ago.I am sure Senators will see many important items in the list of Acts to be repealed. On a personal note, I found the titles of a great number of the Acts to be repealed were fascinating. The list allows us a glimpse into the minds of parliamentarians, as legislators, in those times. It also permits us to sample a flavour of life in centuries past. We take for granted our comforts and all the protections modern legislation affords us. We have become more tolerant, I hope, and more careful and protective of all our citizens, especially the old and the infirm.In particular, I welcome the repeal in this Bill of two Statutes of uncertain date — they are believed to have been enacted in the 14th century during the reign of Edward II — with the offensive titles of "Lands of idiots and lunatics". It is no longer appropriate to have such legislation on our Statute Book and the removal of such antiquated and insulting material will affirm the respect the State owes to all its citizens, regardless of their circumstances.Yesterday, the Law Reform Commission launched its most recent paper on vulnerable adults and the law. It has recommended that phrases such as "idiot", "lunatics" and "those of unsound mind" should be removed from all legislation dealing with the capacity of people with mental disabilities. In this respect, it is most opportune that this House is today complying with that obligation.I am also happy to report that the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002, as passed by this House, will repeal a number of obsolete pieces of legislation, including the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883.The list of Acts to be repealed contains many interesting legislative items.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The Sunday Fairs Act of 1448, which penalised those who kept fairs and markets on Sundays, is interesting.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Yes, indeed. On a more general theme of statute law revision, I am aware that a number of Departments have already commenced reviews of the legislation within their own remit, either in consultation with the statute law revision unit or of their own accord. For example, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has examined land laws. In addition, the customs and excise service is examining relevant legislation and the area of employment rights is also under review.It is difficult for Departments to keep their current legislative programmes on track, but it is essential that we continue to take the time and apply resources to the examination of the pre-existing law. There is simply no point in continually adding to the layers already there. With every new Bill that is enacted, there is an opportunity to repeal spent or obsolete legislation and, where appropriate, that opportunity should be availed of.It is self-evident that the Statute Book should be up to date and accessible. Badly organised and obsolete legislation is a hazard for citizens, the legal profession, the courts, Government and, most of all, the legal process itself. The statute law revision unit is continuing with the programme on pre-1922 legislation and I look forward to piloting further revision legislation.While I realise that we have not yet finished with the Bill's passage through the House, I pay tribute to my officials who have worked on the legislation. It has taken them much time and energy. They are very committed to their work, for which I thank them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I thank the Minister of State for moving amendment No. 3, as well as for circulating a brief description of each of the Acts to be repealed by the Schedule. It is fair to say that this is quite a radical departure from the initial Bill. As the Minister of State has said, the existing Schedule contained 91 Acts, while the new Schedule contains 218 Acts to be repealed. The question any good Opposition Member should pose is whether, if the Bill was not passed until next year, there would be a further 50 Acts in the Schedule?It is clear from the Minister of State's speech that some Departments are better than others at identifying obsolete and impractical Acts that fall within their remit. I join with the Minister of State in giving credit to his staff in the statute law revision unit and the staff of the Office of the Attorney General for having achieved an amazing amount of work. This work should remain under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, through the Office of the Attorney General. I am aware of one piece of legislation that was promised in 2002 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and law Reform, to codify liquor licensing, yet we are still awaiting it three years later.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	165	It is important, therefore, that a strong message emanate from the Department of the Taoiseach, through the Office of the Attorney General, that Departments need to take this matter much more seriously. Reading between the lines of what the Minister of State has said, I suspect that the Office of the Attorney General wishes to give that impression.The Minister of State referred to the question of a practical utility. Has he considered putting a definition in the Bill as to what exactly that utility is? If a matter came before the courts and a barrister used a statute from a previous generation to argue the case, his or her interpretation of its practical utility might differ from the Minister of State's interpretation. Did the Minister of State consider what he means by "practical utility"?The Bill was published in late 2004 and since then the amount of legislation covered has increased to a great degree. Must we revisit this on a yearly basis? How does the Minister of State propose to do that? Will he introduce a Bill on an annual basis to update the pre-1922 statutes or will he do it on a three-year basis? In just six months, the Minister of State has identified an additional 120 statutes that should be included. If we are trying to get this right, we may need to add additional Acts that become obsolete or impractical.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I echo the Minister of State's tribute to the staff who worked on this Bill. Their heads must have been spinning with the names, dates and descriptions.I have been looking at some of the Acts. The Sunday Fairs Act penalised those who kept fairs and markets on a Sunday. I remember when the Minister of State had responsibility for labour affairs, there was a brouhaha about Sunday trading and the possible necessity to introduce legislation — there was already a law in place that penalised people who opened their shops.The Princess Sophia's Precedence Act is interesting. It is said to be one of the most important Acts in British history. Queen Anne had 18 children and survived them all. By 1711 it became obvious that the Queen, then aged 46, would not provide a legitimate heir. This was the first time in British history that a foreigner had been invited by Act of Parliament to take over the throne of England. Had she survived, England would have had a Queen Sophia but she died in the same year as Anne, leading to the accession of George I, the first of the Hanovers.There was an interesting Royal Marriages Act in 1772 in response to the marriage of Henry, Duke of Cumberland and brother of George III, who married someone unsuitable for the royal family. That Act made it illegal for any member of the British royal family under the age of 25 to marry without the consent of the ruling monarch. I heard that Act quoted by a commentator and historian speaking about Prince Charles on BBC recently but he was wrong because Prince Charles is over 25 so he did not have to run to his mother to seek permission to marry, although I suppose he did anyway.Senator Brian Hayes noted that since the Minister of State appeared here on Second Stage of the Bill, his staff have unearthed a great deal more legislation that will fall. I was interested in the point that Senator Hayes made about a barrister finding an old Act that he could use to defend a client. If it is repealed it is no longer valid, but if an Act was skipped and the lawyer used it, even if it dated back 400 years, what would be the outcome?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Since Second Stage, we did not just add to the number of Acts, we also made some changes to the original list. We are trying to mop up but we are conscious that there is ongoing work on intoxicating liquor, land and employment rights legislation and we must be careful not to interfere with such legislation because of that very point. Our staff carefully examine each statute and if it is spent in every sense, it will go but if there is any doubt, it stays.There is much more work to do. We are only starting the process and it is important and exciting. There is criticism of over-regulation and complexity in terms of our membership of the European Union but we are seeking more efficiency in this area. This is part of the bigger picture and we will achieve our goal by getting rid of this obsolete legislation.It will not be long before someone comes back to the House to undertake further work. A. G. Donaldson did tremendous work in his 1956 thesis on the pre-1800 legislation entitled, "The Application of British Statute to Ireland" and the staff involved in this drew from it.We do not prepare or publish revised statutes and there are no plans to do so. The intention is to focus on the pre-1922 legislation, repeal spent and obsolete legislation and eventually repeal, re-enact and modernise, where necessary, the remaining relevant legislation so the full corpus of Irish law would date from post-1922. The ultimate objective is the repeal of all pre-1922 legislation so there will be no need to revise the body of law.The identification of legislation suitable for appeal has been a difficult task. The repeal and re-enactment of existing pre-1922 legislation is a formidable undertaking. It is not available electronically and we should be conscious that we do not lose the tremendous work that was done before the electronic age. It shows how much easier it is now to consolidate or restate legislation. I referred to Mr. A. G. Donaldson's work, which is interesting in its presentation because of the typing errors it includes.I was asked how many pre-1922 Acts exist. The precise number is not yet known but the determination of what is in force or applies to Ireland has commenced and we may have those numbers later this year. The determination of the number of Acts is part of the master list project. At present up to 1,000 Acts still apply to Ireland that have not been repealed. The master list project entails a detailed examination of approximately 25,000 Acts to determine which of them are still on the Statute Book.An assessment is also taking place regarding the possibility of publishing a second revision Bill which will depart from the normal statute law revision mechanism of repeal, which is essentially negative. The new Bill will positively list all legislation remaining in force. The master list will be viewed from a positive perspective rather than a mopping up operation such as this Bill. This will give clarity to citizens and legal professionals as to what pre-1922 legislation remains in force.Projects to assess pre-1922 local, personal and private Acts and pre-1922 secondary legislation will be devised after the completion of the study of general and public statutes. Other efforts, such as consolidation, restatement and codification, are continuing in respect of post-1922 legislation. My office and the Attorney General's office are aware that there may always be criticisms of the numbers of consolidations or restatements and the lack of widespread codification. I assure Senators that efforts are being made on a Department-by-Department basis, as the impetus for consolidation traditionally emanates from Departments. However, we all know the all-consuming demands made by the legislative programme on a day-to-day basis.In an ideal world, it would be beneficial to have codification of relevant laws. We are working towards this ideal. The work programme, already outlined, is a necessary precursor for plans for the future. However, we must focus on the positive and acknowledge that the transparency and accessibility of the Statue Book will be improved with progress such as this revision Bill. This is the beginning of an interesting exercise. It has provoked a good debate in the House. While I would like to see this work continue, there is also the issue of available resources. Departments have their priorities and must manage various crises that emerge. However, there must be a steady work level in this area and I will do my utmost to ensure this work continues.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I understand that much of this is driven by the statute law revision unit which has done sterling work against the odds. Will the Minister of State further outline the modus operandi of the unit? Does it ask Departments which obsolete legislation they want revised? Does it then go through the legislation, submit a view on it and the Department signs off on it?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Then the process depends on what each Department throws up.When this Bill is enacted, it will simply repeal legislation and a revised Statute Book will not be published. The British are beginning to follow this process. It is important for business, the law and people who have to deal with these matters. As the Minister of State said, it is important that, with the development of technology, we reach a stage where legislation dealing with each area of human activity is in a codified system. Has he any timeframe for this? When will the revised Statue Book be published? Any citizen or body involved in this area wants to be able to see a list of the laws concerning certain activities. I am not criticising the Government as it has done more in this area than previous governments. As it is not a priority for governments, it tends to fall off the list of priorities. A revised Statute Book must be consumer friendly.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	171	For example, the Fabric (Misdescriptions) Act 1913 has been superseded by an EU directive. It is important that the Minister of State presses ahead with this work. Secondary legislation and directives are increasingly governing our lives. They tend to come in large tranches, much more than we wish. Not alone will the Minister of State be dealing with Acts from the 13th century and the Princess Sophia's Precedence Act, but he will be dealing with the EU directives with their attendant euro-jargonese, which is difficult to penetrate. Codification of EU directives will also be needed. The Minister of State has outlined a platform of work and I urge him to press ahead with it.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The State Minerals Act 1705 allowed the Queen, on payment of a particular sum, to appropriate all copper, tin and iron. When this is repealed, will new regulations and legislation have to be introduced?The Minister of State referred to the statute covering lands of lunatics. Is that now covered by legislation regarding wards of court? It is quite worrying when one reads how some kings, and others, came about acquiring land.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	173	They whipped it.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	175	New legislation covering minerals has been introduced. Modern legislation also covers the provisions of the Lands of Lunatics Statute. This legislation is spent and has achieved its purpose. Our officials will continue to delve through the various legislation but it is demanding on time. The second revision Bill will examine the matter from a different perspective and will be positive in putting up the existing legislation.This is the first step in an ongoing programme. The Taoiseach initiated this programme for reform for better regulation. Our system of statute law should comply with the most elementary requirements of any system. With regard to Senator O'Rourke's point about EU directives, it will be useful to see existing legislation presented in a positive way and intermeshed with modern legislation. Every repeal that is carried out not only reduces the area of uncertainty but is a step towards the development of a list of statutes in force. One can argue that this work is well overdue. I will do my best to ensure it continues on an organised basis.I thank the officials from my division and the Attorney General's office for the significant body of research and work they have undertaken to bring the Bill to fruition. It has been an arduous task to seek out Acts that still apply to Ireland and then to ascertain if they are suitable for repeal. That involves a lot of work. The fact that so many additional Acts have been added to the Schedule today is testimony to the dedication of those who did the work. I thank them, as does the Government, for the time and effort put in. "Practical utility" is a modern term which we do not define. We examined the Acts and referred them to Departments to see if they use the legislation or have a need for it. If not, and we were happy to repeal certain Acts, we did so. Practical utility could end up as a matter to be interpreted by the courts. However, we need some gauge or measure, and practical utility is the most convenient. Otherwise we would have to keep all our laws forever.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	176	This Bill is not one which will give rise to hallelujahs in the street, or paeans of praise from anyone, yet a great deal of very necessary work has gone into it. No doubt there were many hours of research, checking and re-checking with the Attorney General. I thank him too, because much of the work took place in his office.I also thank the Minister of State. Every Minister likes to promote what one might call sexy legislation. If one talks of café bars, for example, one gets headlines. If one talks of the Statute of Winchester 1285, one does not hear many hallelujahs or paeans of praise, but the Bill is very necessary, and the Taoiseach is to be commended for taking the step he did. He will not get hallelujahs either, but without this legislation the entire administrative system would clog up, with people scratching their heads and wondering if should refer back to Acts of 1344, for example, or of 1918, or whatever. This would result in a complete mess.The Bill is the beginning of a journey. One could call it an adventure, which I suppose it is, but it is the beginning of an ongoing journey which has now been taken up. We wish the best of luck in their endeavours to all those who go down the road of statute law revision. I thank the Minister of State for the time he gave to the matter.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I thank the Minister of State for attending the House and I thank, as he rightly and generously did, the statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General, which has spearheaded this work on behalf of us all in recent years. In particular, I thank Mr. Donaldson, who established that unit, though he no longer works there. I may be wrong about that and do not want to mislead the House.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	178	He is in Paris.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	180	He left the unit as his legacy to the rest of us. I congratulate all who brought the work forward.Looking back at the period from the 1300s to now, it was for only a very short period that we had no Parliament in Ireland, from the time of the Act of Union in 1801 until 1922, or more correctly, for those of us who believe in the Republic, until 1919. Much has happened in that period and it makes great sense for us to repeal obsolete and inoperable legislation of the past. It is important that we do so.Having repealed certain laws, we must now make sense of the situation, and the only way to do so in the long run is to produce a revised Statute Book pre-1922. Much work has been done relating to the period from 1922 onwards but the big problem relates to the operable parts of legislation enacted before 1922. The Minister of State hinted that work is progressing in the area. It is important for business, the law and all organisations which deal with any of these pieces of legislation and Acts to have them codified, and to have the information available in a technologically suitable and compatible manner, accessible by all citizens. I welcome the Bill and I hope it helps us all in terms of overcoming excessive bureaucracy and regulation.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate now and on the last occasion. I also thank them for acknowledging the hard work of the officials involved. I merely present the matter as a fait accompli, but like Members, I found it all an interesting exercise. In politics, we never cease to learn, and this matter has involved a great learning process with which we are all involved. Mr. A. G. Donaldson has moved from his position in the statute law revision unit and the person in charge of the team which has done all the work in this area is Ms Fiona Carroll. I thank her and her team.This is a fascinating area of legislation which I am sure we will revisit. As Senator O'Rourke said, the work involved is important. It will probably not get any headlines, but we are not always looking for headlines and must get on with our work regardless. I remind the House that people like Senator O'Rourke, when she was a Minister, would have been very involved in such work. She was a Minister in the labour area, the same area in which I was involved, working on the process of consolidation of legislation. Much unsung work is being done in the area by Ministers and Departments. The health and safety area provides a good example, as does the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1993.Consolidation means the process whereby the Oireachtas passes an Act which collects all the relevant legislation in a single Act. It is vital work but often unrecognised. There is also the process of restatement, when Dáil debate is not required, which knits together legislation which merely requires to be laid before the House for 21 days before it becomes law. Clearly that is a faster option. Between consolidation and restatement, a lot of good work is going on in the background in various Departments. Senator Brian Hayes is right to say it is important that the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the Attorney General drive this process in which we are involved and provide for better regulation.It is clear that much good work in the area has also been done in the UK, and we can learn from that. I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate. It has been relatively short, but that does not suggest in any way that the work we are doing is not of great importance.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I move:That Seanad Éireann:—maintains that Sellafield remains the single most serious hazard to Ireland's environment;—believes Sellafield should be closed in view of the pollution, poor safety record and devastating impact that a serious accident or terrorist attack could have on all aspects of life in Ireland;—notes the strong commitment in the programme for Government which states that Sellafield is an unacceptable threat to Ireland and should be closed;—commends the Government for ensuring this position is made clear regularly through responses to public consultations on nuclear matters, contacts at all levels and in correspondence with the UK authorities;—urges the Government to continue to use every diplomatic and legal route available to work towards the achievement of its objective to have Sellafield permanently shut;—commends the Government for pursuing separate legal actions against the Sellafield MOX plant through the OSPAR Convention and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, and through participation at EU level and at other international bodies where the Irish position is stated at all times, individually and with like-minded countries;—urges the Government to continue to be a leading opponent, in all international bodies, of attempts to foist nuclear energy on developing countries;—notes, with approval, that the Government joined other like-minded countries in a declaration on this matter at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 and urges the Government to use all other opportunities as they arise;—requests that the Government continues to work with other like-minded countries to stop the international transport by sea of nuclear waste for reprocessing;—requests the Government to keep up-to-date nuclear emergency plans, including sufficient stocks of medical supplies, so as to minimise harm to public health from the effects of any possible exposure to radiation in Ireland;—supports the strong commitment of the Government to seek full disclosure from the UK authorities of all information relevant to accidents, malfunctions, unauthorised disclosures and lapses in safety procedures and of any evidence of heightened risk to health or the environment;—and asks the Government to convey to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, Seanad Éireann's implacable opposition to Sellafield as well as this House's firm conviction that the UK authorities should speedily ensure the safe and orderly closure of Sellafield because of the potential threat it poses to the Irish people.I welcome the Minister of State. I am glad we have such a comprehensive motion before us. We are all aware of the various protests that have taken place over the years demanding the closure of Sellafield. Many people have gathered at, or near, Sellafield and there have been protest songs written about the closure of the plant.I am pleased that, in line with Government policy, Ireland has initiated proceedings on two separate fronts. One set of proceedings relates to the Sellafield MOX plant, under the 1992 OSPAR Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic; the other is under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, known as UNCLOS. Much progress has been made on these two cases.The OSPAR hearing took place in the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague in October 2002. The objective of the OSPAR action was to bring about the disclosure of certain information which had been excluded from two economic reports on the MOX plant, commissioned by the UK. The court issued its judgment on 22 July 2003 and although Ireland failed to gain access to the confidential information withheld from the UK public consultation papers, the court established an important international legal precedent. It determined the following: Ireland has a right under the OSPAR Convention to access information on the marine environment; the UK has an obligation to make such information available; and Ireland has the right of redress to vindicate its rights to such information.The UNCLOS hearing took place in The Hague from 10 to 21 June 2003. The issues in this case included the threat to the marine environment from the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield, including security issues, the threat to the Irish Sea from shipments of nuclear materials and the inadequacy of the 1993 environmental impact statement from the MOX plant. However, at the beginning of the hearing, the tribunal was concerned with arguments from the UK that the issues in dispute were matters of European Community competence and should fall for decision by the European Court of Justice.The issue is the continuing discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea. Unlike sludge, which can be broken down, the radioactive material remains intact in the sea and is moving towards the Scandinavian countries. That is why the Scandinavian countries, particularly Norway, are supporting us. It is of major concern that this practice, which has been going on for years, is continuing and it will take many more years before we find a resolution.The tribunal took the view that it would be inappropriate to go on to consider the merits of Ireland's case while uncertainty remained over the division of competences between UNCLOS, the European Community and the member states. In those circumstances, the tribunal proposed to hold hearings on the substantive case to facilitate a resolution of the issues relating to jurisdiction between the European Community and UNCLOS. However, the tribunal agreed to hear an application by Ireland for provisional measures, pending the hearing of the substantive case. These provisional measures were dealt with and the tribunal issued an order on 24 June 2003 calling on both parties to develop suitable secure arrangements at intergovernmental level to improve co-operation and consultation.Discussions at official level between Ireland and the UK are ongoing on the implementation of the tribunal's order. The provisional measure orders provide a basis on which to improve co-operation and consultation arrangements between the UK and Ireland. Four reports have been submitted to the tribunal to date and the next report is due at the end of May 2005.On the issue of competences between UNCLOS and the EU, the European Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland in the European Court of Justice on 31 October 2003. Written pleadings in the case have been exchanged and Sweden has intervened on the side of Ireland, while the UK has intervened on the side of the Commission. The written procedure is now closed and Ireland has requested an oral hearing at the European Court of Justice. It is expected that the hearing will take place later this year.It would be useful to take a look back at the work of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. I notice, from contact with it and its website, that it has introduced new technology over the years. In 2000 an experimental buoy equipped with a radiation detector capable of continuously measuring radioactive contamination of sea water was placed in the north-western Irish Sea. The new technology also includes instruments for measuring the physio-chemical parameters such as salinity, temperature and current velocity.This particular piece of equipment was developed and constructed by a Norwegian company, Oceanor, in conjunction with the IAEA's marine environmental laboratory and is a good example of co-operation and how countries opposed to Sellafield work together. The Irish Sea project was planned jointly with the RPII and the environmental heritage service of Northern Ireland which supports the project financially. I understand the project is scheduled to run for 12 months and will provide valuable information on the performance of the new technology. It is a useful project. The RPII was delighted to get the new equipment and by the participation of the Northern Ireland environment and heritage office.We may become complacent when we hear the radioactive levels in Ireland due to Sellafield fell in 1999 and 2000, as shown in the main findings produced on radioactivity levels. However, this is an issue the Government should continue to raise with the British Government because while levels may be low, they are undesirable and unnecessary. The Taoiseach raised the matter with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. The case has been made based on the results of sample levels from fish, shellfish and other marine biota from Irish waters. Under the OSPAR Convention we should ensure that our case is highlighted so we can seek the early closure of Sellafield.An issue the RPII has repeatedly mentioned is that of the high-level storage tanks which hold radioactive waste. The quantity of radioactive material in these tanks is such that an accident involving a major release into the atmosphere could have serious consequences at a considerable distance from the plant. The RPII was given unprecedented access by the plant's operators, BNFL, in 2000 to detailed information about the safety of the tanks. The RPII found that while the likelihood of a serious accident is low, BNFL could and should take a number of actions to make the risk even lower. For example, some of the issues relate to BNFL providing more accurate and up-to-date information on the reliability of individual plant components. BNFL also needs to complete its analysis of the potential hazards to the plant from, for example, seismic disturbances. Alternative water supplies for tank cooling are not fully independent of each other. The RPII also recommended that instrumentation for the detection of possible hydrogen build-up should be installed. Another practical issue raised was the random checking of plant personnel for alcohol or drug abuse. The institute also raised the issue of the consequences of a severe accident if one should occur. These issues have not been adequately assessed.I hope BNFL takes action on these matters as suggested by the RPII. There are significant risks associated with the storage of high-level radioactive waste in liquid form. The RPII has suggested that a long-term programme to convert the material to a safer solid form should be accelerated. I hope this will be done. It is a pleasure to propose this motion this evening and I hope the House agrees to it.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity to speak on an issue that affects us all. I commend the person who compiled the motion because it captures concisely and accurately the seriousness with which this and previous Governments have taken the issue.Until the events of 11 September 2001, the idea of Sellafield and the possible consequences for Ireland of an accident or terrorist attack were taken with little seriousness. In some quarters it was only considered with a degree of cynicism. However, since then we realise that such things happen and the probability is that they will happen. Whether we like it, we must plan for such events. When talking about the United Kingdom, we are not just talking about Sellafield.The United Kingdom currently has 14 nuclear plants at various stages of production and decommissioning, 12 of which are magnox reactors, a UK technology introduced in the 1940s and 1950s which has not progressed much since. It is widely accepted that this technology is inefficient and unsafe. Sellafield has two processors, one of which is a magnox plant which has been decommissioned and the other a thermal oxide reprocessing plant, THORP, in which nuclear waste from throughout Europe and Japan is reprocessed.A debate is currently raging in the United Kingdom as to whether to continue with a nuclear power programme because by 2010, all bar two of the UK plants will be decommissioned. However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland informs us:Decommissioning, by its nature, is a slow process that extends over several decades and current estimates are that decommissioning and final site remediation of BNFL Sellafield will not be completed until about 2150 (i.e. 150 years from now).As I have said, this will affect generations to come, not just ourselves and our children.The RPII is one of those bodies whose work only comes to public attention when there is a major incident or accident. However, it has played a crucial role in assisting this and the previous Government in achieving its current position of contact and monitoring between our officials and UK Government officials. Since the initiation of international legal proceedings against the United Kingdom by Ireland in 2002 — on which I congratulate the Ministers of the time, Deputies Cullen and Noel Dempsey — under the OSPAR Convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, in 2003, the institute has worked extremely closely with legal, governmental and diplomatic teams to further the Irish cause with regard to Sellafield.The actions taken have resulted in the setting out of a very important international legal precedent regarding access to information for Ireland under the OSPAR Convention. Under the UNCLOS Convention, as Senator Kitt stated, the fight continues. So far, despite questions about EU competency in certain areas and other issues, it has resulted in much improved co-operation and in access and consultation arrangements being put in place. Given the nature of what we are dealing with, it is clear that more needs to be done, although we have done a significant amount of work. The RPII's recent report on its visit to Sellafield does not make for very good reading.A bilateral agreement was signed in December 2004 after many years of struggle. It provided for visits by the RPII and the Garda to Sellafield and access by this country's authorities to the UK's radiation monitoring system, RIMNET. Ireland receives a great deal of support at EU level and from Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Norway. A significant amount of work remains to be done, however, as Senator Kitt said. The sea and the air around our coasts are being continually monitored. We need to resolve some major issues.There have been many developments since Ireland started to take legal action in this regard. The Calder Hall reactors at Sellafield were closed in March 2003. The RPII is dealing with two specific matters, the first of which is the discharges from the 1970s and 1980s. While there is no significant risk at present, continuous monitoring of the discharges, in particular, is essential. It is accepted that the reductions in discharges which have been sought by the Government will not be achieved until 2020. It is worrying that the authorised discharge, as laid down by the UK environment agency, is greater than the current rate of discharge. There is scope for BNFL to decide to increase the discharges at some stage in the future, for commercial reasons, for example. That is worrying when one considers the nature of the discharges.The second specific matter with which the RPII is dealing is the safe storage of nuclear liquid waste. Such waste, which is stored in tanks at present, accounts for approximately 90% of the radioactive waste at Sellafield at present. I started to understand the commercial nature of this system when I read the section of the RPII report that stated that it would cost approximately £150 million per year until 2020 to clean a magnox fuel storage pond. The substantial commercial and economic pressure that is being placed on the UK Government in this regard is part of the reason for the delays in this area. The Irish Government has to maintain its diplomatic and governmental pressure to get the UK authorities to move on this issue.According to the RPII report, there have been improvements in physical security at Sellafield as a result of contacts which have been built up. Such security measures, including improved fencing around the various sections of Sellafield and increases in the number of armed security guards on the site, have been deemed necessary in light of the threat of terrorist attack and the possibility of accidents. The problem is that there is no framework for assessing the risks and consequences of a terrorist attack. Plans can be put in place and certain measures can be taken, but there is no framework for assessing the risks involved. We should not forget that the onus is on BNFL and the UK Government to provide adequate security measures.The Government has sought the technical information that will be necessary in real time in the case of an accident or a terrorist incident. There will be no point in telling the Irish authorities about an incident an hour, half an hour or 15 minutes after it takes place. We need to get information in real time. The RPII has worked hard to get such information. Recent exercises have indicated that the notification arrangements are working well, which has been welcomed by the RPII. The RPII has expressed deep concern about the lack of access to information about security issues and threat assessment arrangements. The mantra used by the Sellafield authorities is that such information cannot be exchanged for security reasons.Given the nature of this issue and the proximity of Ireland to the nuclear installations in the UK, it is right that the Government has committed itself to demanding the closure of Sellafield, which is the bottom line. Even if the plant is closed, there will be a continuing need to monitor and assess its impact. I warmly welcome and second the motion, which succinctly and correctly sets out the position the Government has taken.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	189	There is a great deal of public disquiet in Ireland, not only about the manner in which the Sellafield facility has reported incidents and accidents in recent times, but also about the weak response by the Government to such incidents. The time has come for all political parties to go to the European Court of Justice because this issue has serious implications for the entire Irish community. We want the Sellafield facility to be closed in the interests of the safety of our people. A catastrophe is waiting to happen if we sit on the sidelines.The scandalous abuse of safety at Sellafield is a European issue. The Government did not succeed in its bid to close Sellafield when it went to the UN international court, but some progress was made. We need to continue to bring all possible pressure to bear on the UK Government to close Sellafield. The high level waste tanks at Sellafield pose a serious risk to the east coast of Ireland. If the cooling tanks overheat, a large amount of radiation will be released. Sellafield was the main topic of discussion at the Local Authority Members Association's conference in Dundalk last year. Local representatives expressed the views of the people about what is happening at Sellafield.The US Congress commissioned the United States Academy of Science to compile a major study of nuclear power. The report, which was published last month, highlights the danger of nuclear power and describes the storage of radioactive liquids as a critical security issue in the United States. Traces of radioactivity from Sellafield have been detected in seaweed and shellfish in Norway. We know that discharges have been taking place since the 1970s, just as we know about the appalling nuclear accident of 1957.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	202	As I said, we know that an appalling nuclear accident took place in 1957, shortly after the Sellafield plant opened. Important records about reprocessed material were routinely falsified over the years. Sellafield's main customers, Japan, Germany and Switzerland, have been frightened away as they have learned that Sellafield suffers from lax safety standards, as well as what is known among nuclear inspectors as "management failure". Last year, I, unlike Senator Ross, who would sit on the sidelines and make comments, visited Sellafield.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The press office did not give the Senator this bit. I am delighted. He should keep going.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I saw for myself what was happening there. Several times when I tried to pose questions that members of the public are posing to public representatives, I was told that my questions were out-of-date and that there was no need to ask them because safety could be guaranteed at Sellafield. I spent two days visiting the plant and returned to Ireland with a great sense of fear.If we needed any further proof that we are being treated with contempt by our UK counterparts, we need only look at the recent major leak of radioactive material at the THORP nuclear reprocessing facility at Sellafield. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, was only notified of the accident three days after it occurred. This made a farce of the signing of the bilateral agreement on the notification of nuclear incidents and the exchange of information on nuclear facilities, which the Minister, Deputy Roche, signed last December. This agreement provides for both Governments to take appropriate measures in the event of a serious nuclear incident. Clearly, the British Government was unaware of its commitments or decided to ignore them for a considerable period in regard to the recent incident.Reprocessing is carried out at the THORP facility at Sellafield, which reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to recover its plutonium and uranium content. It is now likely to be closed for an undetermined time as a result of this accident. An estimated 83 cu. m. of radioactive liquid — enough to fill two normal family living rooms to the ceiling — escaped from a broken pipe into a concrete chamber before it was detected on 18 April last. As this chamber is now heavily contaminated, it is unsafe for workers to enter. Any clean-up operation may have to be carried out using robots or other remote control instruments. It is still unclear when the leakage began and the incident has been classified as category three and described as serious on the seven-point international nuclear event scale. The spilling of two chambers of radioactive liquid cannot be dismissed as being of no threat to Ireland or our food chain, with the resultant health and economic consequences.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The extraordinary response from the UK Government to our current concerns is that radioactive discharges from Sellafield pose no threat to human health or the environment, that the Sellafield plant and associated transports are safe and secure and that the legacy waters arising from the UK's nuclear programme are being addressed through the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which has taken over ownership of Sellafield from British Nuclear Fuels.However, the UK must be aware that the danger does not only lie within. The ever present threat of terrorist action following the 9/11 attacks, and the potential catastrophic repercussion of such action for Ireland were Sellafield to be a target, must intensify the need for us to put pressure on Britain, Europe and the international community. We are in grave danger from radiological sabotage or an attack on shipments from Sellafield. Ireland, like Belarus, which is situated next to Chernobyl in the Ukraine, has no nuclear plants, but a terrorist attack on Sellafield could leave us devastated. The high-level waste storage facility at Sellafield has the largest radioactive inventory in Europe.I have no doubt the Government, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has good intentions in regard to the closure of Sellafield. I urge the Minister to allow no loophole to remain and to spare no effort to bring this about. A weak response at any level to this threat would be a blow to the safety and health of our people and the protection of the environment.Politicians from the North and South of the island are at one in regard to the closure of Sellafield, in particular politicians on the east coast. I have spoken to many members of the National Association of Councillors and the Northern Assembly. There is also unanimity among the political parties in this House.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. This issue has arisen several times since I entered the Seanad. We have continued to raise the subject as often as possible because it has become a real security, environmental and health risk to the people of this country.I commend the Government motion. It is clear the Government put a lot of work into the issue, which was a central plank of its election manifesto and programme for Government in 2002. We have lobbied politically and pushed every available angle to achieve the closure of Sellafield. Unfortunately, the plant remains open and it appears it will do so for a long time to come.I commend the Government on taking the legal action which has brought this issue to centre stage. Although the case taken through the tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was not successful, the judgment recommended that the Irish and British Governments should discuss improved co-operation and consultation in regard to the MOX plant at Sellafield. This resulted in the visit by the RPII to the Sellafield plant last September, a trip that brought some useful information into the public domain.Having said that, there are still major concerns regarding the plant in Sellafield. Another part of the recently agreed procedures between the Irish and British Governments was notification of accidents in the plant. However, after the recent major leak of radioactive material — enough to fill two typical family living rooms — it took three days for the RPII to be informed of the matter and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was not told of the incident by its British counterparts, via the British Embassy, until four days after it happened.I encourage the Government to place as much pressure as possible on the United Kingdom to address this serious discharge. It is not good enough. Any accident in Sellafield needs to be relayed to the Irish authorities immediately. We cannot allow a system to be introduced that will see information pass through a chain of diplomacy before we are informed. The Irish people deserve better; we deserve to be the first to be told. It should be remembered that London is further away from Sellafield than Dublin, yet we had to wait for the information to be relayed to us from the British capital. There should be direct contact between officials in Sellafield and Dublin. There is no need for information to go from one pillar to another before we hear of it.When compiling its report on Sellafield, the RPII noted that its British counterparts did not disclose their assessments of a threat of terrorist attack for reasons of security and the institute reported its serious concern. It might have understated the case in this regard. How can we expect to deal with a disaster without the co-operation of the British authorities? We do not have access to information that would show the potential main problems and the aspects which would be of greatest concern to the Irish people. It is rather weak for the British authorities to hide behind the excuse of security reasons. The British Government is not the only one that would have to deal with the implications of a terrorist attack should one occur. Britain would also enjoy the benefit of being removed from the danger, unlike us on this side of the Irish Sea. The British authorities must have far more respect for our situation in this regard and not hide behind flimsy excuses. They cause more fear by suggesting they do not know what would happen in the event of a terrorist attack.Some of the information put into the public domain by the National Cancer Registry is also a cause for concern. I am not a doctor or a medical expert, but it is odd that the registry published a report stating that the increased incidence of cancer in County Louth cannot be attributed to radiation from Sellafield. According to the registry the higher cancer rates in the county are more likely linked to factors such as smoking, diet and sun exposure. Its central argument is that smoking is the only shared risk factor for the cancers found in higher numbers. However, this statement is shortsighted. Nuclear radiation affects everything from the food we eat to the air we breathe and even our simple physical development. Did the National Cancer Registry take a deeper look at why diet in County Louth is different or why more people there are contracting cancer through smoking? Radiation possibly weakens people's immune system and perhaps this makes them more susceptible to cancer in County Louth rather than being the specific cause. However, it would appear that the only environmental difference between County Louth and other parts of the country is its proximity to Sellafield. This is a case of scientific research not seeing the wood for the trees.I welcome the Government motion and urge the Minister, his Department and colleagues to ensure the good work and links that have started are maintained and that the desire to shut Sellafield remains top priority. Such a motion should be proposed every so often so that we can reinforce the concerns expressed by many.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	223	With the permission of the House I propose to share my time with Senator McCarthy. I am delighted this motion has been proposed because I have been tabling motions on Sellafield for a very long time in a similar, but perhaps not quite so detailed, manner. No matter how many times motions are tabled regarding Sellafield and the danger it poses to Ireland they have little effect, and this is one of the many failures of both Houses. The Government has great and good intentions in putting forward this motion, but the end result will be the same as the motions I previously proposed and the court cases and confrontations between the Irish and British Governments with regard to the issue.The story of Sellafield is pretty pathetic and has involved discussion, protest and the taking of the issue to various courts and local and international levels. However, nothing has happened. Senator Ormonde is absolutely correct in her enormously passionate and eloquent speech. The Government has not been met with any great friendship or reciprocation by the British Government and it is a terrible blot on Anglo-Irish relations that an issue of this sort should persist. It shows a certain paternalistic contempt for this country by our closest neighbour and potentially greatest friend. We share much in common with the UK Government and work in great co-operation on so many issues that it is an extraordinary reflection of their attitude to Ireland that it should allow such a deep and potentially wounding threat to persist and ignore the representations made by our Government.Regardless of what the BNFL claims, the dangers posed by Sellafield are very real indeed. All of us have been subject to the propaganda which comes over the airwaves. The BFNL has a brass neck because it always puts out one of its spokespeople to reassure us that Sellafield is not dangerous. However, Sellafield is extremely dangerous and some of the statistics quoted this evening illustrate this. The MOX plant produces waste and water which will remain radioactive for 250,000 years. Such a figure is unthinkable and I do not know how we might deal with such a situation. It will take at least 150 years to decommission Sellafield and the radioactive dangers contained therein. It is quite obvious from surveys relating to fish and the extraordinary leukaemia clusters around Cumbria that this is an evil in our midst which we must cleanse and do something about. One of the British Government's defences is that it is being cavalier with the lives of its own people, although it does not use that language. However, that is cold comfort to us. It is up to the British Government if it wants to treat its people in this way and have a nuclear reprocessing plant on its land, although I think it is wrong. However, it is vital that we have a say when it threatens us.The issue of a terrorist threat is of an extraordinarily uncontrollable dimension. It pops up from time to time and then disappears. After 11 September 2001 we all became very conscious of Sellafield and started to talk about what might happen if a suicide bomber crashed into the plant. If that happens and the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, as Senator Brady suggested, then we are in serious trouble and could suffer a huge number of diseases and deaths as a result. The potential is huge. The British nation is a primary target for terrorists because of its political position on the Middle East and other world issues. That position taken by Britain is threatening our livelihood, our health and our future. We must take this issue more seriously and use every platform where the British and Irish Governments meet to raise it. We must take it not just to prime ministerial level but to the level of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. We should include it in the Northern Ireland talks because as Senator Ormonde said, people in Northern Ireland are just as affected by this issue as ourselves. It is the one issue on which we can unite because of the threat to us. We must do what little we can to protect this country from the threat of Sellafield.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I thank Senator Ross sincerely for sharing his time with me. I welcome this important debate and concur with the comments of previous speakers. This is an issue that, from time to time and for various reasons, has slipped off the agenda yet there have been countless opportunities to keep it to the fore.Casting our minds back to 11 September 2001, we are all too well aware what a civilian airliner loaded with aviation fuel can do to buildings. The consequences of the events of 11 September were devastating and catapulted this issue back into the public domain but it has fallen back since then. This issue must be kept to the fore, and not just in terms of the Northern Ireland talks, which would provide an ideal opportunity to discuss it with a view to taking a proactive measure. It could be raised in a European context also.I acknowledge this plant is Government owned, that it is an important part of the UK economy and that it supplies one quarter of the UK's energy but as a result the Irish Sea is one of the most radioactive bodies of water in the world. The danger it poses to the environmental and physical health of our nation is frightening and there is a clear consequence also in terms of trade. Many Irish fishermen have caught mutated fish. It is not a mystery why fish, shellfish and sea plants in the Irish Sea often contain substantial amounts of radiation.There is no doubt that the dumping of radioactive waste puts human life at risk. Spray from the Irish Sea turns into radioactive dust and can be found on beaches and in people's homes. I will give the House some startling statistics based on factual information. There are increased rates of cancer, not just on our east coast but also on the west coast of England. There is a little village near Sellafield called Seascale where a disproportionate amount of cancer has been reported among the population. The residents have to be convinced that this is as a direct result of Sellafield. There is also an unusually high number of leukaemia cases among children but in March 1996, Government scientists in the UK were able to produce a report that concluded there was no link between the cancer levels and radiation from the Sellafield plant. I can only assume that intelligence is as inaccurate as the intelligence the Prime Minister received on weapons of mass destruction. We are all aware what happened when Governments wanted to advance the destruction of civilian lives in the Middle East. They were able to produce dossiers that supported a belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We now know who was right and who was wrong about that but it is unfortunate that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered in the process.Sellafield has 11 silos of radioactive nuclear waste, each containing an amount of waste eight times the amount released by Chernobyl in 1986. That is a startling statistic. Sellafield is of benefit to the UK economy but it is of no benefit to this country. It is all risk and danger. On the last occasion of a leak at Sellafield, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was notified within a few hours. That was a change in terms of the track record of that institute and a welcome development.The first part of the motion states that Sellafield should be closed in view of the pollution, poor safety record and devastating impact a serious accident or terrorist attack could have on all aspects of life in Ireland. That is not realistic. A total of 15,000 people are employed directly or indirectly in the plant at Sellafield. The British Government will not shut down the plant. We would want that to happen but we must be realistic. The process of attempting to shut down this plant should begin with a call for an immediate halt to the reprocessing at the plant. That would be a step in the right direction.There is an irony in the Government's motion this evening. The Government agreeing to proceed with an electricity interconnector to Britain casts a slur on the motion and represents marked hypocrisy in terms of its purpose and the Government's track record.I call for an immediate cessation of reprocessing at the Sellafield plant and urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to make the Government aware of the importance of discussing that issue in the Northern Ireland talks. That is a critical forum in which to advance it, not just in the European context but in the Northern Ireland context also.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	225	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the Department, I am pleased to strongly support this motion on the Sellafield nuclear plant. While this plant lies in the jurisdiction of our near neighbour, the United Kingdom, at its closest point it is located less than 120 miles off our coast. The Irish Sea has been subject to continuing radioactive discharges for over 50 years. Due to the potential risks from a major accident or other incident, Sellafield represents potentially the most serious health, environmental and economic hazard to this island.Ireland rejected the use of nuclear power many years ago. Our position on Sellafield is that the Government will not rest in its efforts to secure the safe closure of the Sellafield plant. We will continue to take all diplomatic, political and legal avenues open to us to achieve that aim.The most recent serious incident at the THORP plant only confirms our resolve in that position. While our efforts have been successful in securing greater understanding and a better flow of information between the UK and Ireland, particularly in the past year or so, that does not in any sense undermine our fundamental policy regarding Sellafield.For our part, I assure the House that the Minister, Deputy Roche, and the Department will leave no stone unturned in pressing the concerns of the Irish people in seeking the safe closure of Sellafield. To this effect, the Minister wrote this week to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs seeking a meeting to discuss the issue.I am aware that all Members of this House are at one in agreeing that Sellafield continues to be an issue of widespread concern among Irish people. As an endorsement of that, I need only refer to research undertaken on behalf of the British-Irish Council and the British Embassy in Dublin in 2003 on attitudes among Irish people to the UK in the 21st century. Some 80% of those surveyed considered that the relationship between the two Governments was good or excellent. However, the contrast was striking when the issue of Sellafield was brought into the frame. A significant 72% of those sampled considered that, on the issue of Sellafield, there remained much room for improvement.While the relationship between Ireland and the UK has never been better, Sellafield sticks out like a sore thumb. We still have a very long and difficult journey to travel on this issue. It is evidence of the deep difference in policy perspectives between both Governments and the lack of real engagement on the issue that our Government felt obliged to engage in international legal proceedings against the United Kingdom on Sellafield. That reflected the continuing concerns of the Government to demonstrate the seriousness of the issues and place them centre stage.Ireland initiated legal proceedings on two separate fronts against the Sellafield MOX plant under the 1992 OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS.Oral hearings in the OSPAR proceedings took place in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in October 2002. The objective of the OSPAR action was to bring about the disclosure of certain information that had been excluded from two economic reports commissioned by the UK on the MOX plant. The information had been withheld by the UK on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.The Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal issued its award on 2 July 2003. Although Ireland failed to gain access to the confidential information withheld from the UK public consultation papers because the tribunal deemed that the information sought was not environmental information, it did determine that Ireland has a right to access information on the marine environment. The tribunal also determined that the UK had an obligation to make such information available and that Ireland has a right of redress under the convention to vindicate its rights to such information. The tribunal therefore established a number of extremely important international legal precedents.In October 2001, Ireland launched separate legal proceedings against the UK on the MOX plant under UNCLOS. That arbitration remains suspended pending resolution of jurisdictional issues in the dispute raised by the EU Commission. The legal proceedings between Ireland and the EU Commission on those jurisdictional issues which deal with access by member states to dispute procedures provided under UNCLOS are continuing. Written pleadings in this case before the European Court of Justice have been completed and it is expected that the hearing will take place later this year.However, the UNCLOS tribunal issued an order in June 2003 after hearing an application by Ireland for provisional measures. The provisional measures award and orders recommended that Ireland and the UK enter into dialogue to improve co-operation and consultation between the two Governments and report to the tribunal on specified dates. These discussions are continuing.It has been the Minister's view for some time that there is significant scope for both Governments and administrations to develop a higher level of co-operative engagement on the nuclear issue. He does not consider that such engagement will compromise our position on the fundamental policy differences on Sellafield and the broader nuclear issue between the two Governments. What it can and should do, is provide a platform for informed engagement on the issues that divide us. It is in this context that the provisional measures order of the UNCLOS tribunal was opportune and significant. This order provided for the development of improved co-operation and co-ordination measures between both Governments on the nuclear issue.At the first opportunity the Minister reported on the progress from the co-operation discussions, at the signing of an agreement on notification and exchange of information arrangements between Ireland and the UK in December last. The agreed package of measures announced then is designed to address a wide range of issues related to nuclear safety. The package facilitates visits to Sellafield by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, and the Garda Síochána. It also provides real time access for the RPII to the UK's radiation monitoring system and it includes a series of initiatives to develop and improve existing co-operation arrangements between both Governments. This package of measures represents progressive, practical and real improvements in the relationship between Ireland and the UK on the nuclear issue.The measures deal with the sharing of information, which is vital for emergency planning in the event of an accident or incident at a nuclear plant. They are about improving communication, co-operation and co-ordination between friendly neighbouring states. They cover identifying risks and threats and enabling national authorities to exchange information on, plan for, and actively address those risks in an informed way. Fundamentally, they deal with identifying areas of mutual interest and concern and putting in place systems and structures to enable those areas to be addressed.Senators are aware of the recently published report by the RPII on its visit to Sellafield and I am sure they will join with me in complimenting the institute on its work. Its report, which should be widely read, is the essence of clarity on a difficult and complex technical issue. This co-operation allows our experts to advise and inform the public and the Government with the benefit of having visited the Sellafield site. It is the intention of the UK to facilitate further visits by the RPII to Sellafield. I welcome this and the Government appreciates the professional and expert engagement of the institute's board and staff in this important process.While the package of measures developed and put in place represents significant progress, the historically poor safety record and recent events at the plant only exacerbate the real concerns of the Government about Sellafield. This poor safety record and the recent incident at the thermal oxide reprocessing plant, THORP, also reinforces the clear commitment given in the programme for Government that we will continue to work towards the safe and orderly closure of the Sellafield plant.Following a September 1999 finding that quality control data for MOX fuel destined for Japan had been falsified, the UK safety regulator published three investigative reports. The first dealt with the scandal itself. The second report stated that there was "a lack of a high quality safety management system", "insufficient resources to implement even the existing safety management system" and that there was a "lack of an effective independent inspection, auditing and review system within BNFL". The UK regulator made 28 recommendations, the implementation of which was required to fully meet the standards expected of a nuclear site licensee.In March 2004, the EU Commission issued a directive to the UK because of an infringement of the safeguards provisions of the EURATOM Treaty relating to the accounting for nuclear material in a storage pond, B30, at the Sellafield nuclear plant. This storage pond, apart from breaching the safeguards provisions of the Euratom Treaty, is also a significant radioactive and environmental challenge that needs to be addressed.The recent spill at the THORP plant was a very serious incident. I understand that following detailed evaluation the incident has been assigned as a class 3 incident under the international nuclear event scale. A malfunction occurred within the process in the plant where the spent fuel is sheared and dissolved, and shearing was suspended on 18 April. Camera inspections were subsequently carried on 20 April in order to inspect the vessels and pipework in the feed clarification cell. This inspection identified a failure in the pipework system along with signs of liquor spillage and some corrosion of the structural steelwork adjacent to the tank. As a precautionary measure, the front end of the plant's reprocessing operations was closed down on 21 April.The spillage, which contains uranium, plutonium and fission products, is on the floor of a sealed cell with walls several feet thick, but the amount involved was approximately 15,000 gallons. Given that the spillage was contained in a secondary containment area, there has been no abnormal activity in the air and no risk to employees, the local community or the environment. In particular and thankfully, the incident has no immediate implications for Ireland.Notification of the incident by the UK authorities to Ireland was made on 21 April. Notification arrangements were in accordance with the established procedures for the exchange of information about such incidents. Given the need to examine, assess and evaluate the incident itself by the UK authorities in order to establish the circumstances involved, the RPII has confirmed that in its view the notification by the UK authorities was prompt and effective. Additional information is being made available to the institute by the UK authorities as the situation develops.These examples are indicative of the concerns raised for this Government and the Irish public by the continued operation of the Sellafield nuclear plant. The THORP incident, in particular, has again brought into sharp focus in Ireland and among a number of other EU member states, the very strong and real concerns the public has with many aspects of the nuclear industry in general and Sellafield in particular.The highly-active storage tanks represent the most significant terrorist threat in Sellafield. The UK authorities have implemented a number of enhanced physical protection measures in attempts to address this risk. Additionally, assurances to the effect that the terrorist threat to Sellafield nuclear plant is continually reviewed and assessed have been received from the UK authorities. Nevertheless, the Government has continuing concerns regarding the threat posed by the tanks and this is one of the issues addressed in the international legal actions undertaken by the Government.There is an obvious conflict between the necessity for the UK authorities to ensure the security of the installation is not compromised by limiting access to security sensitive material and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's need for access to information to provide advice to the Government and the public regarding threat assessments and security arrangements. In this regard, the access provided by the UK authorities to the Garda Síochána has been useful. Further visits and contacts at senior police level are continuing. Access to further information sought by the institute is also one of the issues being addressed in the UNCLOS discussion process. The Government will continue to keep the national emergency plan for a nuclear accident up to date to the highest international standards.In 2002, potassium iodate tablets were made available to households nationwide as part of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Minister of State should not go there.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	227	A review group established by the Department of Health and Children, chaired by Dr. Barry McSweeney, chief science adviser to the Government, is currently examining the continued use of iodine tablets as a countermeasure under the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents.The International Atomic Energy Agency is the principal organisation dealing with nuclear matters at the international level. The agency plays a vital role in setting safety standards and providing for their implementation and co-ordination in member states. On this basis, the United Kingdom has primary responsibility for ensuring the operation of the Sellafield nuclear plant is safe and secure. Nevertheless, Ireland's concerns about Sellafield are clearly and consistently articulated at all suitable opportunities, both in the IAEA and in bilateral contacts regarding the work and mandate of the agency. Ireland actively engages with the agency on a range of issues with the primary objective of ensuring that the safety and security standards adopted by the IAEA reflect only the highest international standards. This in turn will assist in ensuring that nuclear installations in the United Kingdom and globally can be as safe and secure as possible.One of the principal areas of engagement by Ireland at the IAEA in recent years has been on the issue of the transport of radioactive waste by sea. Coastal states including Ireland argue that, given the risk posed and public concerns about such shipments, it is necessary for coastal states to be fully informed regarding such shipments to enable them to assess the risk and take appropriate measures concerning emergency preparedness and response should they consider it necessary. Ireland has participated actively and constructively and has co-sponsored a resolution with like-minded states at the IAEA's general conference on this issue.While the issue will continue to prove difficult, the most recent resolution in September 2004 provides a basis on which to address the concerns of coastal states. Ireland, together with like-minded states, will continue to pursue these issues at the IAEA and other relevant international fora. Regarding the transport of radioactive spent fuel by sea, I can also assure the House that the attention of shipping states, including the United Kingdom, is regularly drawn to the Irish Government's policy on this issue in bilateral and multilateral meetings at diplomatic and official level.The issue of Sellafield also receives rigorous attention in the context of Ireland's participation in the OSPAR Convention. In June 1998, the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention at the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR commission in Sintra, Portugal, adopted a strategy on radioactive substances. This strategy effectively provides for the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges to the maritime area of the north-east Atlantic, which includes the Irish Sea, by 2020 through progressive and substantial reductions in such discharges.The Irish Government's view remains that continued discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea from Sellafield are untenable and should cease. The welcome success of improved abatement techniques recently introduced at Sellafield in reducing dramatically the amount of technetium-99 discharged into the Irish Sea indicates the real potential for addressing this issue in a constructive way. Active engagement on this issue, with like-minded countries such as Norway, was a significant factor in prompting a positive response from the UK. I am committed to availing of every opportunity in all relevant fora to maintain and develop alliances with like-minded states to address issues of common interest on Sellafield.At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002, Ireland joined a political alliance of countries opposed to any promotion of the use of nuclear energy as a renewable energy source in developing countries. Ireland, along with Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Greece and Austria, signed up to the view that nuclear energy should have no place in the European Union's new energy partnership initiative for developing countries.Decisions on nuclear policy taken by the UK can potentially have considerable impact on the interests of Ireland. In this context, we have repeatedly emphasised that Ireland has a significant stakeholder interest in the deliberations and consultations that inform such decisions. For this reason, our policy is to proactively engage in these consultative processes and our concerns are clearly and regularly conveyed to the UK authorities. These include most recently, the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency, NDA, and the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, CoRWM. While there remains a significant difference of views between the Irish and UK Governments regarding UK nuclear policy, the legal and diplomatic offensive mounted on the Sellafield issue has contributed significantly to a greater understanding and awareness of the Irish position by the UK authorities.The measure of the problem of Sellafield is that it is not only a problem with which we have to deal, it will form a legacy that our children and grandchildren and future generations may have to deal with. The view of this Government is that the only long-term, viable and acceptable option is the ending of reprocessing and the safe and orderly closure of the plant. This Government has never wavered from our view that Sellafield should be closed. The case for closure is compelling and the closure process by the United Kingdom should begin soon. This is the message that has been conveyed and will continue to be conveyed to the UK Government at all levels of contact up to and including contact between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister.The Government will continue to use all diplomatic, political and legal options to achieve this objective. I am glad the House is having this debate. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, would have liked to attend but he was called away at the last minute. I am sure he is pleased the debate is taking place and I apologise on his behalf for his absence.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is a very substantial speech concerning our Government's involvement in Sellafield, about which there is a great degree of public concern. Motions coming before both Houses should reflect this concern. We support this Government motion and wish to support any action the Government may take.I will approach this subject in a different vein. I wish to put on the record a number of political realities that need to be recognised. New Labour is committed to nuclear energy. It made a complete U-turn. When it was in opposition, it was against nuclear energy. When it entered government, it was for nuclear energy. The White Paper produced three years ago gave a commitment that nuclear energy would represent somewhere between 15% and 20% of Britain's energy component over the next 25 years or so even though New Labour wanted to reduce it.Unfortunately, there is now a political consensus about a nuclear future in Britain between the Conservative and Labour parties, as seen during the recent general election campaign when the very controversial issues of decommissioning existing plants or locating new plants were shunted to a review. The matter was not even dealt with in the election. This is a blatant reality because, when there is a consensus on this issue between Britain's two big parties, we have a problem. The only people who can change the policy are either of those parties when they are in government. Quite frankly, this is a real issue we must confront.Another reality is not one I address lightly, namely that of jobs in a very deprived area of north-west England. I visited Cumbria and it is a beautiful part of England. We can speak about peripherality but one could not find a more peripheral regional part of the UK than Cumbria. Trying to get from Manchester Airport to Cumbria takes approximately four hours by car. If we are serious about telling a community that 50,000 jobs directly and indirectly connected to the plant must go, we must also produce a few ideas about how we will re-employ these people.The British Government scandalously underutilises that beautiful part of Britain, indeed, our Government is possibly guilty of underutilising our regions in terms of providing proper regional development policy. One cannot fly into Cumbria and there are no decent roads into it. There are no tourism opportunities. If we are honest about this debate, we must announce what we propose to do with 50,000 people who need jobs. Dr. Jack Cunningham, the MP for the area, will tell one his view on this particular issue if one asks. If we were to suggest for even a minute that 10,000 jobs would be wiped out in any of our own constituencies, there would be a political price to be paid.The great crime of the British and French is that none of the technology they have developed since the Second World War has been given to Asia, particularly Japan. Most of the actual business of reprocessing is the Japanese-Asian business that comes half way across the world to France and Britain so that they can do Asia's dirty work for it. None of the technological advances the British, French and other Europeans developed in this field was ever shared with Asia. This is another reality on which we must focus. Reprocessing "dirty" energy by sending it half way around the globe is unsustainable. How can we as Europeans share the technology we have advanced since the Second World War? Due to problems with Japan and the war, there is a significant reluctance to share any of this agreed technology.As other speakers such as the Minister of State have rightly said, even if we close Sellafield tomorrow, what does one do with nuclear reactors? I am unaware of any complete solution to managing a plant that is decommissioning. I have visited Sellafield as a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and I commend my colleagues on that body for agreeing on a report between British and Irish parliamentarians. That British and Irish MPs, Senators, Lords and Deputies have managed to come to an agreement is significant considering we differ fundamentally on many of these issues.I met Mr. Norman Askew when I was at Sellafield. I am unsure whether he is the current CEO but he was when I met him two years ago. I was astonished to discover that the International Atomic Energy Agency is on site to discover how much plutonium and uranium is "knocking about the place" in order to keep an eye on this very dangerous material. I asked Mr. Askew why Ireland's experts, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, cannot be based on site. The Minister of State said the RPII wants access to information but this is not good enough. Ireland should want access to the site, a point on which the British Government should be able to concede. I asked Mr. Askew whether he would have any difficulty with the RPII being based in Sellafield full-time, independently going wherever it wants and making any reports or announcements . He said he had no problem with that prospect whatsoever but that it is a decision for the British Government despite his being in charge of the plant.The time has come for the British Government to face up to this issue. Whatever it says about Sellafield will not be believed by anyone. Similarly, whatever Mr. Askew and the BNFL say about Sellafield will not be believed by anyone. We have gone beyond the stage of examining the straightforward issue. If we have a competent international body in the RPII, it should be based on site carrying out the activities I mentioned earlier. We should campaign for this, which is a part of an amendment I made to a similar motion two years ago but that I do not see in the Government's motion tonight. We should be able to deliver on this issue. If we are honest about the new relationship between North and South, there should be a new relationship between east and west. This means that Britain must treat our concerns on this matter in a much more serious way than it has to date.Equally, we must face up to their realities, such as the employment and political issues I mentioned. I am not confident that legal action will change this situation. At the end of the day, it is a political decision. New Labour is committed to a nuclear future, as is the Conservative Party. While this commitment remains, Sellafield will unfortunately remain open. We must do everything we can and one of the ways we can make progress is by demanding that the RPII is based on site with the exact same rights and powers as the International Atomic Energy Agency.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	229	This is a suitable, strong and timely motion and I add my support to the points made and words of genuine concern expressed in the House tonight. This motion is timely for one particular reason, on which I will use my few minutes to expand. On 11 May, the RPII made a presentation to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. The RPII deserves credit for its presentation and much of what it had to say should form part of our discussion. Regarding nuclear power plants in operation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the RPII ensures up-to-date information on accident scenarios that are likely to impact on Ireland is available to inform our emergency arrangements. During its presentation, the RPII summarised briefly the background to its recent visit to Sellafield and the issues of most concern to Ireland. I will recount this summary, as both positive and negative findings should be aired when debating the plant.The RPII has concluded that the routine operations at the Sellafield site give rise to radiation doses that are not significant from a health point of view. Most of these doses result from exposure to radioactivity discharged in previous years, specifically in the 1970s and 1980s. The RPII found that, unless a very significant increase in discharges occur, these doses are not expected to increase by a large amount in the future. On the other hand, based on information provided during the RPII's visit to Sellafield, the worst credible and reasonably foreseeable accident involving storage tanks could result in levels of contamination to the food chain here that would require intervention by the Irish authorities.I will now address an issue that is often raised in connection with the matter of Sellafield, which is the risk to Ireland from a terrorist attack on the plant. According to the RPII, while there is a well established and internationally accepted framework for assessing the safety of nuclear installations in respect of accidental failures, the situation with regard to terrorist attacks is very different. There is no widely accepted or transparent methodology for assessing risks or consequences. In Sellafield's case, I understand the UK authorities have re-evaluated their assessment for the threat of terrorism. However, this information has not been made available to the institute on the basis that it might compromise security and safety at the site. Perhaps there is some role for our Government in making the relevant information available to the State in a confidential manner.However, the RPII also indicated that the UK's nuclear installations inspectorate, the NII, has reassured it that there is now a high level of protection in the form of engineered safety assistance and physical security. In so far as possible, the NII has looked at various aeroplane flight paths that could impact on the tanks. As regards how aircraft could breach the tanks — and given the strength of the tanks at that point — it is believed that there would not be a serious risk from an 11 September 2001-style attack. More work should be done to reassure the public, both here and in the United Kingdom, in this regard. At this point, I believe most people would share my healthy scepticism on the issue.People here and in Britain are unhappy about the operation of Sellafield. The history of the plant is somewhat worrying, so I am glad that this matter is being kept under the spotlight by debates both in this House and outside it.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to the House. The particularly strong language of the motion is to be welcomed also, encompassing as it does a clear commitment from the Government. I am happy to support it. The most worrying aspect of Sellafield is that the problem cannot be solved in our lifetimes. No matter what we do, there will still be a difficulty there for another 150 years, according to the recent survey referred to by Senator Brennan. The concern is that an accident at Sellafield followed by an easterly wind would bring the sort of destruction here that we saw in the Ukraine in 1986. If that happened our food chain would be contaminated for decades, if not for generations.I know the Minister shares my worry that every time someone undertakes a safety survey at Sellafield, they come out with an extraordinarily optimistic view that they will now implement 24,000 new safety measures. Senators will excuse my exaggeration in this respect. Every time such a safety survey takes place, however, I wonder how dangerous Sellafield was before and how dangerous it will be in future. Is it getting safer or will it always be dangerous?I do not know the answer to questions that have been raised about the risk of cancer from Sellafield. I have heard the various arguments reflecting different views. There are those who say that Sellafield is a safe issue for Irish politicians and, so, it is easy for them to take a hard line on it. That is the line I take, and I make no apologies for doing so.Will the Minister examine the possibility of undertaking a survey of Sellafield's possible impact on disease and illness? Are the stories about Sellafield's carcinogenic effects correct and, if so, where do we go from here? There is no economic argument to justify the continuation of Sellafield.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	232	There is certainly no environmental argument in its favour. Nothing is as likely to drive Irish people mad as listening to the polite, plummy accents of people from Sellafield who try to tell us that there is no environmental risk from the plant and that nuclear energy is a safe and environmentally clean way of producing electricity. That argument does not work. Sellafield is the dominant polluter of the Irish Sea and that fact must be dealt with. I would like to be able to add with certainty facts concerning Sellafield's carcinogenic impact on the Irish population, including skin and other forms of cancer. At different periods, surveys have been undertaken on various parts of the east coast but they seem to have come up with conflicting reports. Nonetheless, the evidence produced by a number of investigative programmes on RTE showed without doubt that Sellafield had a problematical impact.It is impossible to discuss Sellafield without balancing the argument by examining alternative methods of producing energy. One way to demolish the economic argument for Sellafield is by taking a strong line in favour of alternative energy sources. I have raised, both in the House and privately with the Minister, the fact that there are no financial supports or tax incentives for wind energy here. Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does not provide such support for that alternative energy source. When the issue of wind energy was raised recently in the House, a spokesperson on the Government side said, "But isn't wind energy for free? Why should we be paying any money for it?" That was an honest reaction from the other side of the House but I wonder how far we have to go to convince some people of the need for wind energy projects. It is in all our interests, as well as being an investment in our future, to ensure that wind production is given the go ahead. Last Sunday morning, I heard an interesting discussion on this matter between Dr. John FitzGerald and Mr. Eddie O'Connor. The latter was a serous loss to the public service.I want to debunk the arguments against wind energy. Wind farms may be unattractive but we should be prepared to put up with them. They may affect our skyline but as long as they are producing environmentally safe, green energy we should support their use.Opponents of wind energy say that in Ireland the wind only blows 33% of the time. That may be so in some locations but it is blowing 90% of the time in others.

If the output of wind farms was tied into the national grid, we could supply at least 70% of Irish energy needs. Britain could do the same and that would be end of the anti-wind energy arguments.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I regret that my time for contributing to this motion is so limited, for it deals with an important subject. Sellafield has health and safety implications for everyone currently living on this island. In addition, given that some nuclear material can remain active for thousands of years, the implications for future generations are clear. The official website of the Sellafield complex shows that the programme of work for managing the nuclear facility is scheduled to continue for the next 150 years.Item 35 on Sellafield's official website deals with the managing director's commitment to the people of Britain. Apparently, therefore, we, on this side of the Irish Sea, do not count. The managing director states that Sellafield "represents the most challenging nuclear site management programme in the world". The site manager's message states:Management services, Sellafield, have the skills, experience and commitment to deliver this life-cycle baseline [that is the programme for the future] safely, securely and with care for the environment. We will continue to aggressively drive down our costs, providing greater value-for-money delivery for the taxpayer.That seems to sum up the priority of the facility, namely, to reduce costs and make money. What is the scale of the financial turnover of the facility? The report states that Sellafield will "introduce our plans to significantly accelerate the reduction in radiological risk and hazard on the site, whilst securing commercial income in excess of £8.2 billion from the provision of spent fuel services". That is a considerable income and it appears that it is worth securing with greater efficiency and zeal than the efforts made to protect the health of Irish people across a narrow stretch of the Irish Sea.In any political conflict between the abstract health, safety and protection of people outside a jurisdiction and those within it, who are economically dependent on the Sellafield facility, which will win out? Consider these simple statistics, again from an official source:The Sellafield site covers an area of approximately 2 square miles and has been operational since the 1940s. The site comprises more than 200 nuclear facilities, represents some 60% of the total UK civil nuclear liability to be discharged by the NDA, and provides work for over 10,000 people, 95 % of whom live within 30 miles of the site.In other words, Sellafield represents a huge political commitment, or a political minefield if it closes with the loss of a high proportion of those 10,000 jobs, and the Irish people are treated as no better than pawns in the game.The management of Sellafield declares that "Sellafield represents the most challenging nuclear site management programme in the world. Management Services, Sellafield, has an unrivalled understanding of the site and a demonstrated ability to deliver improved safety and environmental performance whilst exceeding production targets and delivering clean-up." I would like to believe that but it must be read against a background and history of mistakes, cover-ups, lies, forged and falsified records, accidents and bungling inefficiency, the kind of mistakes and deception which, in any other private facility, would see its management fired forthwith.To get some idea of the scale of the operation in Sellafield and the enormity of the task facing any Irish Government we should look at the timescale for the next 150 years. By 2016, all commercial operations associated with reprocessing, MOX fuel manufacture and vitrification of high level waste are to be completed. By 2040, all legacy wastes should be retrieved, packaged and stored and shipment of those intermediate level waste materials should have commenced to the intermediate level waste repository. By 2075, all intermediate level waste should be shipped to repository and shipment of high level waste to its repository should have commenced. By 2150, the site should be in a safe, passive state, subject to institutional controls pending final decision on its future.The only certainty today is that none of us will be around in 2150.

That is not exaggeration or scaremongering but a realistic assessment of the situation with which we are presented. We do not accept that this should be so and we must regularly place on record our opposition to it, our desire that remedial action be taken and ultimately, sooner rather than later, that the site should be closed, cleaned and made safe.We have some idea of the scale of the battle facing our Government today. It is, and will continue to be, difficult for our Government to make inroads on this problem while the private financial stakes are so high. I commend the efforts of the Taoiseach in raising this issue with the British Government and his forthrightness in pointing out the risks for us. I also commend the outspoken, independent and courageous stance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who knows better than most the risks for us all, especially those who live on the east coast. I am not naïve enough to think that this problem can be solved overnight but I am confident that our Government will keep this matter high on its agenda with its British counterparts.I subscribe fully to the intent and aspirations of the motion before us this evening. I accept the points made therein and wholeheartedly support every Government attempt to keep the single biggest national risk at the top of the international agenda and to seek, in the words of the motion, "full disclosure from the UK authorities of all information relevant to accidents, malfunctions, unauthorised disclosures and lapses in safety procedures" and the other elements of the motion.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I apologise for my lack of a script. I gather Senator Ross objected to the number of people reading from scripts. I would read from one if I had one but I only have my own disconnected thoughts.Although this debate has taken place many times over the years, and I used to take a principled and sometimes leading part in it, we are now so used to it and so accustomed to being rebuffed by the British that a certain life has gone out of the debate. The unanimity of the House, however, is significant. I hope the unanimous passing of this clear and specific motion will provide a significant weapon for the Minister. I hope that the Taoiseach, who enjoys a close relationship with Mr. Blair, might be able to use this in discussions with him because it is unacceptable that there is an accident on 18 April and we are not told about it until 21 April. That was coyly skated over in the script I received. It is outrageous that the British waited three days to let us know about an accident.The Minister had to go elsewhere for more important matters but in his absence, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, made a remarkable contribution. If anything nasty goes off in Sellafield, I suggest the Minister of State makes the announcement because he read his script in such a reassuring fashion with no hint of excitement whatsoever, not even the mildest modulation of tone. If he were to make the announcement the Irish people would be immensely reassured.Unlike him, however, I will be unable to take the cyanide tablets or whatever the Government provided.

The Minister did not get any either. That is a national scandal, I feel a tribunal coming on. They are not the slightest use anyway so I am not too deprived but I would have liked to have seen what they looked like. I had to contact the Minister's predecessor to get my millennium candle as well so the north side is deprived, with neither iodine tablets nor candles. We need the candles because when the lights go out across Europe, we will need to light our millennium candles to see where we put the iodine tablets.The Minister of State's speech dealt effectively with the court cases but the outcome, even though it is a marginal advance, represents what in the game "relievio" are called baby steps. The plant was told they must make a better attempt to communicate and there was nothing mandatory in the judgment. That is a pity and I hope this motion encourages the Minister to continue his efforts to get this matter properly resolved.This has all happened in my lifetime. Until 1947, Sellafield was a straightforward munitions factory. In 1947 it decided to go into the nuclear business and by 1949 had generated enough radioactive material to explode a bomb in Australia. I remember clearly the fire in 1957 at what was then called Windscale. In 1949 there was already a 2 km pipeline discharging radioactive material but that was controlled while the 1957 incident was an uncontrolled discharge of radioactive material into the atmosphere. There are lingering suspicions that this has a connection with clusters of leukemia around Dundalk. I have a feeling in my bones that there is a connection, although it is difficult to prove scientifically. Certainly there are parallel clusters of leukemia occurring in the children of those who were workers at Sellafield.The fire in 1957 was a disaster greater in scale than the incident at Three Mile Island in America. That is the risk we face. Why are we facing it? Even the British accept it is an economic nonsense. It was always an economic nonsense and a loss maker, so why did BNFL go into it? It could not even get that right because it lied and falsified material, alienating its largest client, Japan. For no economic advantage to the British Exchequer and in a manner that alienates not just Ireland but also Norway, which was co-plaintiff in the case, BNFL is transporting dangerous materials to be reprocessed from all over the world through the Irish Sea and by aeroplane. There are concerns that these convoys, either at sea or on railway tracks, could be the subject of a terrorist attack. That is not likely but it is a possibility that must be examined. There is also the possibility of an aeroplane being crashed into the plant, considering the Americans did not manage to stop a similar attack on the Pentagon. This would result in the discharge of 8 million litres of material which is an enormous amount. We have the most radioactive sea about which there are music hall jokes. We are directly concerned in getting the British Government to take a proper view on the matter.The report of the European Parliament's scientific and technological options assessment concluded that radioactive discharges from the Sellafield and La Hague sites are the largest anthropogenic releases of nuclides in the world. It also concluded significant increases in the incidence of leukaemia has occurred both near La Hague and the Sellafield reprocessing plant. This report is not suggesting post hoc ergo propter hoc which, as the Minister of State knows, is most often a logical fallacy.The report also concluded that the release of a fraction of high-level radioactive waste at Sellafield will be several dozen times greater than the release at Chernobyl and cause over 1 million fatal cancers. Any Member who has seen what happened at Chernobyl, even on television, will be alarmed. It also notes dissatisfaction with the European Commission's verification procedures.I strongly support this motion. In some ways I looked at it with a certain degree of light-heartedness but it does not detract from the strong support I give it. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government on their work so far, but more must be done. The Minister must use this motion, which will be passed unanimously, as a political instrument with his colleagues across the Irish sea.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I support the broad thrust of the motion but the terms are somewhat self-satisfied and buaileam sciath; what wonderful people we are as we do not have a nuclear industry and we can tell everyone else how to run theirs. I have lived all my life 90 miles downwind from Sellafield for 90 days a year. Of the other 270 days, the wind blows in the opposite direction. Creating hysteria does not help with this issue, as this is not the biggest threat to the health or well-being of the Irish people.Senator O'Toole raised the issue of the Minister commissioning research on the matter. I recall 25 years ago commissioning research from Dr. Sidney Lowry in Belfast. At the time there was concern about the high incidence of leukemia among young adults along the east Down littoral and the nearest place to Sellafield. The research concluded that there was no observable connection. There was more irradiation from the average granite gatepost than there was from Sellafield. We also examined the incidence of Down's syndrome in Northern Ireland and discovered there was a higher rate in Norway which is as far away as one can get from Sellafield. There is no proven connection in that way. It does not help to create these bogeymen.What there has been in Sellafield is abominably bad management which at times has been criminal. The cover-up and falsification must be addressed. There is going to be a continuing management task there. I agree with much of what Senator Brian Hayes said. As the site is providing much employment, it will not be closed down. Even if it were closed down, it will not go away. Dealing with this site will be a problem for centuries ahead. The best the Minister can do is ensure that management is transparent, responsible and under control.It is also important that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland should have a base on the site. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that it would be a great improvement if it had a permanent or semi-permanent presence there with access to the information it needs. The best way forward is through British-Irish governmental linkages.International agencies and regulatory bodies, such as EURATOM, must also be used to ensure activity at the site is minimised, the transport of noxious materials is limited to the greatest possible extent and material that needs to be stored is done so to the highest degree of safety. More progress would be made that way than us calling other people names. It is an important task and I commend the Government for the progress already made. We must ensure the Irish authorities competent in this field have a permanent presence and access to the site, that there are published reports, transparency in the workings of the site and that local management is held accountable.

It is true that our power is limited. Everything possible has been done in the legal process. As there are several nuclear powers in the world, there is limited scope to raise the matter through the various international conventions.A disaster at another nuclear plant would not have the same impact on the surrounding area. At Chernobyl hundreds of square miles were devastated with lasting health effects. That the waste has to be stored for thousands of years shows that it is peculiarly dangerous material. What we do not want is a complete disaster that will devastate Cumbria and parts of Ireland, be it by terrorist attack or whatever.A month ago, there was, to put it politely, a malfunction. Reprocessing is unnecessary and uneconomic costing the British state approximately €36 billion. The British taxpayer is a creature I do not understand. How do they tolerate the amounts spent on propping up its nuclear industry? Britain's Labour Party Government is pro-nuclear but that does not mean it has the same commitment to reprocessing. At this stage it is a purely political issue, an employment issue in Cumbria. We must keep alive a sense of the dangers, which are of a quite different order to anything else we have around us.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for attending the House and I thank all who contributed to the debate. It seems that the motion has unanimous support and if so, it sends out a powerful message from the Seanad.Following the visit by the RPII to Sellafield in September, 2004, its report was presented to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. What it said regarding the need for significant investment in Sellafield for up to 25 years, until the site is decommissioned, even if the plant itself is due to close in 2012, is interesting. I accept the point made by Senator Brian Hayes regarding transparency and the need for more information and access by the RPII. The RPII has made a number of visits to Sellafield. It is interesting that its chief executive has spoken about the significant changes in Sellafield between the visits in 2000 and 2004, for example, particularly regarding the issue of waste arising from the closure of the magnox reactors.The RPII report deals to a large extent with safety commissioning. It acknowledges that its visit took place as a result of regular meetings which take place between representatives of the Irish and British Governments. I hope that those meetings will continue and that we will have more information.I was concerned to see what the chief executive officer of the RPII said about the information supplied to the RPII: "The potential contamination levels in Ireland, arising from a series of accidents or incidents at Sellafield, could be such that the Irish authorities would have to intervene to reduce contamination in the food chain". Senator O'Toole referred to this very serious issue for a country which is so proud of its good record in food production.In its report of May 2002, the RPII said that while radioactivity levels in Irish food are very low, particularly in milk products, and in baby foods, beef, lamb and poultry, Irish drinking waters were found to comply with legal requirements and the World Health Organisation guidelines for water quality from a radiological perspective. When I checked this further, I discovered that the sampling from public water supplies takes place only every four years, though it may take place more often in the major population centres. If that is going to be the case in the future, we would need more sampling of water to ensure that we comply with the safety guidelines for water supplies, and for radioactivity levels in food.This has been a very good debate. We were given a good deal of information in the speech by the Minister of State. We must work together — and are doing so by means of this unanimous motion — to achieve what is set out in this comprehensive motion, which above all is seeking the decommissioning of the Sellafield project.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The matter I raise relates to the imprisonment of people because of non-payment of debt. This issue was first brought to my attention by Ms Esther Lynch, the legislation and public affairs officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and I subsequently received help from Mr. Paul Joyce, one of the drivers of change of this legislation.Imprisonment for non-payment of debt is governed by the enforcement of the Court Orders Act 1926, as amended in 1940, and is the culmination of a long-drawn-out process in which the debtor often plays little or no part. It begins with the service of legal proceedings which the debtor rarely if ever defends, as the fact of the debt is not contested. As a result, there is no court hearing, and the creditor enters summary judgment by filing the appropriate papers in the relevant court office.Although the debtor is informed of the judgment, it may take some months before any enforcement action is taken. One of the most common methods of enforcement to recover the debt is the instalment order procedure. This involves the debtor being summoned to send in his or her details of income expenditure in advance of having his or her means examined in open court on a specific date.Given that debtors are often in poor financial circumstances, with multiple debts, and because the hearing is held in open court, debtors rarely attend. This often results in an instalment order being made for an amount of money which the debtor cannot afford. Failure to meet the terms of that order may lead to a committal summons being served on the debtor, who is then imprisoned.In this day and age, that is archaic legislation. The procedure is flawed first because it fails at an early stage to establish the financial position of the debtor, taking into account all of the person's debts. A debtor's debt should be examined in totality, not on a case by case basis. The procedure takes place in public, which is guaranteed to ensure that the debtor does not appear. Further, it fails to take into account the stigma associated with debt, and the stress, panic and shame which many people feel in such a situation. To involve a criminal sanction which is totally inappropriate for a civil matter and impacts adversely on the debtor and his or her dependents, is extremely costly, with no return for the State. It also does not benefit the creditor.Nobody benefits from the imprisonment of an individual for the non-payment of debts. Not only is the debtor temporarily precluded from any chance of repaying, because he or she cannot earn money while incarcerated, but the serving of warrants and imprisonment of individuals for non-payment of debts is a waste of taxpayers' money, prison space and Garda time.How many people are currently in prison for non-payment of debts? The free legal aid unit within ICTU has requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set up a high-level committee to look at the reform of this archaic legislation and take into consideration consumer pressures and demands, and the spending and borrowing by consumers in the 21st century.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	248	As and from 5 May, there are two prisoners, one male and one female, in Irish prisons for the non-repayment of debt. Senator While will be aware that a person committed to prison as a result of the non-payment of a civil debt is committed for failure, through wilful means or default or culpable neglect, to obey an order of the court. Before the court makes such an order, it would have to go through an extensive procedure involving an instalment order and finally a committal order.This is a mechanism for enforcing the court's instalment order. The threat of imprisonment can be effective and many debts are paid off when the prospect of imprisonment looms. Persons committed to prison for non-payment of debts do not qualify for remission of sentence under the rules for the government of prisons.It cannot be presumed that all persons failing to meet their debts do so because of poor financial circumstances. Imprisonment is only used in cases where the courts are satisfied a person has the ability to discharge a debt but has not done so. In many cases, when a person committed for failure to pay a debt or fine is faced with the reality of imprisonment, he or she makes the payment.A number of issues have been raised in this context. One argument, for example, is that attachment orders might be used as an alternative to imprisonment. However, attachment orders do not always work. An attachment of earnings order has a role in the case of an offender who has a salary and who thinks that it would be cheaper to spend a few days in jail than to pay a civil debt. However, those circumstances do not exist in all cases.Senator White is correct regarding the pressures of modern society and the extraordinary availability of consumer credit. Consumer credit is a fact of life in our society but, unfortunately, many in our communities experience the down side of over-extending their borrowing arrangements or get into difficulties because there has been a change in personal circumstances, such as illness. The Government has paid attention to dealing with these cases. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, provides a crucial service for people who require help and advice in making their way out of serious debt. The Government has made significant financial resources available to the service in 2005 — the figure for this year is in excess of €13.6 million. The seriousness of the problem is highlighted by the fact that MABS sees more than 16,000 new clients annually and has more than 30,000 clients on an ongoing basis.The approach adopted by MABS offers a better way of achieving a result acceptable to both creditor and debtor. However, while MABS gives practical finance and budgeting advice and practical assistance in helping to engage with creditors, it does not pay debts. It simply helps people through the process. District Court judges recognise the work of MABS and in some instances they recommend that people who are before the courts avail of the service. It is, however, often difficult to persuade persons in debt to engage in the process. Sadly, some people leave their debts until they reach the point, as happened in the two cases I mentioned earlier, where imprisonment looms. The willingness of a debtor to manage his or her case is crucial and seeking expert advice is the best way forward if there is to be a successful resolution to the problem of indebtedness.The number of persons in custody at any time for non-payment of debt reflects the fact that imprisonment is a sanction of absolute last resort. As I mentioned earlier, there are only two prisoners serving sentences for failure to pay debts, which represents 0.5% of the prison population. The role of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that of implementing the order of the court as custodian of the person concerned for the duration of his or her sentence — nothing more and nothing less. It does not have a role in operating a debt management service. However, the Government has given particular attention to this issue and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in particular, has had much to say on personal debt recently.There are procedures in place for people who find themselves in difficulties and people would be well advised to use them. While as much assistance as possible is available through MABS and financial institutions, a small number of people in debt are often reluctant to engage in the process, despite their situation, and that must be recognised. However, the imprisonment option is one of in extremis and it follows a very lengthy process. People are given opportunities but sadly there are vulnerable people who fall through the cracks. Imprisonment is a punishment visited only at the end of a very lengthy process and is the final, rather than the first, solution.

Limerick County Council informed me that the issue has been with the Department since 24 January.I ask the Minister to tell the House when Limerick County Council will be in a position to prepare tender documents for the scheme; to give a broad outline of the procedure from this point on; and tell us when we can expect to see the scheme come to fruition. Will the scheme be completed in 2005?

At that meeting the members of the association outlined their frustration at the ongoing delay in the start of the much-needed Kilmallock sewerage scheme. Their frustration is justified because of the conflicting information received from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as to the proposed start-up date. On 31 July 2003 the then Minister, Deputy Cullen, indicated that the scheme would commence in 2004. There was understandable disappointment that the target date was not achieved. Recently, the current Minister, Deputy Roche, indicated that the scheme would commence in 2005 and that he would monitor developments to ensure that this will happen.I ask the Minister how sustainable this projected date is, given that Limerick County Council's brief was received by his Department on 24 January 2005. Why is it taking so long? It is now over four months since his Department received the required information. How long will it take the Department to complete the process? We must bear in mind that when the Department approves the brief, Limerick County Council will have to prepare contract documents and submit them to the Department for approval. Does the Minister believe that the target commencement date of 2005 will be achieved?The people of Kilmallock are upset over the long delay in the commencement of the scheme. Can the Minister give a realistic date as to when the scheme will start? The people of Kilmallock deserve to know because it is very important for the development of their town. The existing sewerage scheme is over 50 years old and because of its inadequacies, growth in the town is being stifled. There are developers who want to build in Kilmallock but there is genuine concern that the town will not grow to its full potential unless this much needed sewerage development, costing more than €9, proceeds soon. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I thank the Senators for raising this issue.The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over the last number of years. I am glad to confirm that Kilmallock is set to gain a new sewerage scheme as part of the drive to upgrade our national infrastructure.The unprecedented investment in new water and sewerage facilities under the national development plan has made a key contribution to economic growth and has benefited many parts of the country. Limerick is no exception. The Government has allocated €143 million for new schemes under the latest phase of my Department's water services investment programme. Last year saw the opening of the multi-million euro Limerick main drainage scheme, a project that has copper-fastened Limerick's ability to continue to attract inward investment, to provide jobs and to function as the major commercial centre in the mid-west.My Department's water services investment programme includes funding for more than 20 locations throughout County Limerick, where planning of new infrastructure is movingahead rapidly. Towns and villages like Adare, Patrickswell, Athea, Askeaton, Foynes,Shanagolden and Glin can all look forward to new sewerage schemes. Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies from the major upgrade planned for the Clareville water treatment plant, improvements to the Shannon estuary water supply scheme and extensions of the Limerick county trunk water mains.Funding has also been set aside in the water services investment programme for the Kilmallock sewerage scheme. Costing more than €9 million, it has been assigned construction status in the programme and can go to tender immediately, once the necessary preliminaries have been completed. Limerick County Council's preliminary report for the scheme has already been approved by my Department. The brief the council subsequently produced for the appointment of consultants to draw up contract documents for the scheme is currently under examination in the Department and we are in ongoing consultation with the council about it.I understand that the Department's examination will be concluded shortly. I will relay to my officials the concerns expressed by both Senators. When the brief is approved, the council will be in a position to proceed with the appointment of the consultants and preparation of the contract documents. How long the contract documents take is a matter for the council and its consultants, but given the complexities involved, it could take several months. Tender advertisements and award of contract will follow on that.I am conscious of the strong case the Senators have made for getting this scheme started quickly. As far as my Department is concerned, we will do everything possible to avoid unnecessary delay and no doubt Limerick County Council will do likewise. The necessary funding has been allocated for the scheme in the water services investment programme and that money will be available for drawdown by the council as soon as the work can start on the ground. In the meantime, it is important for my Department and the council to push through the intervening stages as quickly as possible.As Senators know, I have always been impatient of excessive bureaucracy and paper shifting. I am anxious to move the project along as quickly as possible.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I thank the Minister for his presence in the House to discuss the issue of a sewerage scheme for Scariff, Feakle and Quilty. This matter has been under discussion between Clare County Council and his Department for a considerable number of years. The various reports have been presented at the relevant stages, but unfortunately we still do not have a start date for the project.The Minister is aware there were some complications with the project, particularly with regard to the necessity to receive a foreshore licence on the Quilty side of the scheme. Unfortunately, this has protracted the development of the scheme. The situation is now causing significant problems in the villages concerned and the lack of development is destroying potential. The lack of facilities creates a greater difficulty for people who want to live in the area. It also creates planning concerns under Government and council development plan policy because people brought up in the town are unable to get planning permission for rural areas.The difficulty is that there is no housing available in the towns, particularly in Scariff. I am aware, because I have been working with two young couples about to marry, that people are not able to get planning permission in surrounding areas because they are not from those townlands, yet there is no housing available in their town. It is unreal and unbelievable that a couple starting out cannot get a home. If these sewerage schemes were progressed, they would resolve this problem.The development of the sewerage schemes would also resolve the issue of one-off rural housing about which we hear so much. People want to live in the countryside, but they would be happy to live in villages and towns if planning permission was available to allow development. However, because of the lack of infrastructural facilities in places like Feakle, Scariff and Quilty, the council will not give planning permission to schemes where the developer has already purchased land and is ready to commence. These schemes which would provide much needed housing cannot get the go ahead.The situation is now reaching crisis point in these villages. Many of the people who want to live in the area must move 25 miles or more to find suitable housing in areas where there are sewerage schemes in place. I urge the Minister to expedite, however he can, the sewerage schemes for these villages. I have discussed the issue with the Minister in the past and I am aware there were complications. However, we need to find some way to fast track these schemes. It is not good enough for the council to pass the buck to the Department and for the Department to pass it back to the council. There must be a method to deal with the situation. Although the Minister is not long in the Department, he has shown an aggressive attitude in dealing with bureaucracy. I urge him to use that same vigour and zeal to deliver this project.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I thank Senator Dooley for the opportunity to become involved in this short debate. In the discussion we had earlier on Sellafield there was a mention of iodine tablets. Unless we get some good news about the Quilty aspect of this scheme, I will need something stronger than iodine tablets before I travel to west Clare at the weekend.This scheme has been driving the people of Quilty and Mullagh crazy. It has been planned and talked about for 20 years. It was understood for a long time that sufficient funding was not available to undertake such schemes. However, what has really frustrated people is that they know that sums of up to €30 million or €40 million were left unspent in the Department budget for schemes such as these.I would be quite happy to meet the local community at any time if it was the case that the plans were ready for the scheme but we could not go ahead with it because there was no money. The people would accept, believe and understand that. However, they cannot accept a situation where the money is available yet they have been waiting 20 years or more for a scheme because of bureaucracy, delays and the fear another Department had for the prospects of the Greenland white-fronted goose.The Greenland goose comes to Mutton Island which is adjacent to Quilty and the fear was that the outfall might in some way damage the goose. The fact is that the local community is damaged for the lack of this scheme. The Greenland goose will survive. It has survived for a million years, and I am sure it will last a bit longer. Will the Minister please use his influence with his engineers, officials and Clare County Council to get this scheme moving without further delay, before we need strong medication to put up with the existing local frustration?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I will bear that last point in mind and do everything that I can, both for the Greenland goose and the people of Quilty. Before making my official response I wish to point out that the issue currently delaying the scheme is that the Department is waiting for material from the county council, material that was requested in February. I take the point made by both Senators about the need to avoid excessive bureaucracy.I thank both Senators for raising this matter. These schemes are being advanced as part of the €4.4 billion expenditure package in the national development plan. I am anxious to spend that money. Senator Daly is right that the situation is frustrating. I must knock on the door of the Minister for Finance to ask for resources, but when I have resources left over it is difficult to move the programme forward. Last May, my Department published the water services investment programme. The total allocated to County Clare under this latest phase is €194 million for new water and sewerage schemes for some 40 towns and villages, an extraordinary amount which is the highest figure that any Government has ever allocated to County Clare. I am anxious that we spend that money, but I have a responsibility to ensure we get value for money and mind the taxpayers money.The investment programme includes major sewerage projects for Ennis-Clarecastle as well as Ballyvaughan, Corofin, Doolin, Kilkee, Kilrush, Carrigaholt, Labasheeda, Cooraclare, Shannon town, Broadford, Ennistymon, Liscannor,Miltown Malbay and Spanish Point. It also includes water supply schemes for Ennis,Newmarket-on-Fergus, Ballyvaughan and the west Clare regional scheme. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a number of locations around the county, including Gillogue, Clarecastle, Clonlara and Tulla.It is clear from this that a large number of towns and villages in Clare will directly benefit from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard. I am pleased to say that Scariff, Feakle and Quilty-Mullagh are part of that positive picture. The sewerage schemes for these towns are being procured as a grouped project which has been approved for construction status under the water services investment programme.My Department received contract documents for the project from Clare County Council last November. While the contract documents have been examined, the Department cannot complete its assessment until additional information and documentation subsequently requested from the council in February comes to hand. The main item outstanding is an up-to-date water services pricing policy report, often referred to as a polluter pays report. The council needs to certify that all aspects of planning, including the acquisition of a foreshore licence for the Quilty element of the project, have been completed. I understand that all such aspects have been finished. The pricing policy report will be a key factor in helping my Department to complete its examination of the contract documents. The report will identify the proportion of the overall capital cost that relates to providing sewerage services for the existing domestic population in each location and the additional cost attributable to existing and future commercial activity.Under the pricing policy framework, the Exchequer funds the domestic share of the scheme. The local authority has to raise the balance of the capital from non-domestic consumers. The pricing report will identify the unit cost of servicing each existing household. To demonstrate that the proposed piped collection system and new treatment plant is an economic solution, the unit cost figure will need to compare reasonably well with the cost of installing a single house treatment system. We cannot avoid this value-for-money process if we want to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent properly. The House will appreciate the importance of achieving value for Exchequer moneys. We are the custodians of the taxpayers' resources.When pursuing sewerage schemes of this nature, the Department has to take account of the economics of the scheme as a whole, the justification for individual components of it and the need to phase some of the works to take account of current needs and potential future demand. The council must be satisfied that it can finance a scheme's non-domestic component by collecting capital contributions from existing non-domestic consumers and future developers.The pricing policy report in this instance, which is awaited from Clare County Council, will bring clarity to these issues as they relate to the Scarriff, Feakle, Quilty and Mullagh scheme. The report will allow the Department to finalise its examination of the contract documents, which will then be used as the basis for tender invitations.I have listened carefully and taken note of the points made by the Senators this evening. As both Senators said, I have no time for excessive bureaucracy. I would like as many as possible of the outstanding issues to be ironed out. I sometimes wonder why it is necessary to write lengthy letters which are passed back and forth through the mail. People could deal with things much more expeditiously by using the telephone and e-mail.I am anxious that construction of the scheme should start as quickly as possible. I assure the Senators that there will be no avoidable delay on the part of the Department when the outstanding material that is awaited from the council has been received. If the Senators bring this debate to the attention of the council and inform me of the response they receive, I will do everything I can to make progress as quickly as possible.

It is clear from his extensive and detailed reply that a number of steps have yet to be taken. Some further information has to be provided by the council, for example. When that step has been taken, there will be negotiations between the Department and the council to decide who will pay for the various elements of the scheme. I ask the Minister to intervene personally in this case, in light of the length of time for which it has been under discussion. That is the only way to address the serious social problems I mentioned. Some individuals cannot purchase or obtain homes, for example. The Minister's offices should intervene to ensure that progress is made.
