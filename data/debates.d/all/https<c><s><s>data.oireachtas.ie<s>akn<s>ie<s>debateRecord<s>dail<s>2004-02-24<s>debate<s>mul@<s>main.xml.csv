#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	0	It is estimated the total cost of the communications unit for 2004 is €314,402. Some €120,428 is a direct cost to my Department with, on average, €38,795 being borne by the five other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit. The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that in a full year the communications unit saves Departments approximately in excess of €175,000. That was at the last date we used them, which was about eight years ago.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1	An 18-hour day would cover most radio stations. Will the Taoiseach provide a breakdown of the €314,402 costs for his communications unit? Will he explain how he described its role some time ago in the following terms: "It reports what the media is saying on various issues, so the Government is not spending enormous amounts of money on putting out its own message." What exactly does that mean? If the persons running the unit are sitting in their offices listening to every broadcast, including what the media are saying about what the Government is or is not doing, why is that information not made available either by e-mail or in the Oireachtas Library? If there is nothing underhand about it, it should be available to everybody so that we will all know what the media are saying. God knows, sometimes we all wish they would not say some of the things they say, but that is neither here nor there.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The total cost of the communications unit for 2004 at €314,402 is made up from staff costs. There are six staff involved and this relates to their total salaries and secondment salaries. There are four executive officers, a staff officer and 2 chief executive officers. The office overheads are also included but most of the costs arise from salaries. I can provide the Deputy with a written note on the breakdown. As I have said many times, the unit deals purely with the national media, including national newspapers — it does not deal with provincial newspapers — and the main national radio stations, including some of those that broadcast in Dublin. The unit gives the headline news. Whenever Departments require detailed transcripts or tapes of what is on the news, the unit supplies them. Previously, they went to outside companies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In respect of the national broadcaster, the unit works for 18 hours per day. Does that mean people have to listen to all the current affairs programmes from "Morning Ireland" right through to "Playback" in the early hours of the morning? Is somebody listening to all of this? People can download from the Internet RTE programmes that were broadcast some time ago, so one person could do a presentation on what is being said in the media about the way the Government is conducting its business. Perhaps the efficiency of the unit should be examined. If people are currently listening to current affairs programmes all day and then producing a synopsis for Departments of what the media said about Government issues, could the communications unit be made more efficient?Are the press cuttings and transcripts of interviews presented to members of the Cabinet? Would the two Ministers sitting beside the Taoiseach receive a series of press cuttings stating what is being said about Departments? If that is the case, could this material not be left in the Oireachtas Library so that every Member of the House could reflect on the glory, or otherwise, being showered upon members of the Government and on members of the Opposition?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The communications unit does not go into that detail. It provides a synopsis from the main bulletins and newspapers, without comment. There is no political comment on what I, other Ministers or Opposition spokespersons said. It is just the news of the day on paper. Copies of the issue have been seen many times.With regard to transcripts and tapes of events, if the information or press office, or any other section of a Department, seeks such information, the unit will provide it rather than use an outside company for it. Deputy Kenny makes a valid point that the unit should examine its own efficiency to see if it can do things in a more efficient way. It is staffed from 6 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on a three shift basis. The early shift is 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the others are 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. Most of the time a maximum of two people is involved. The staff complement is six, although the unit only had a staff of five for a long period. However, I think it is back to six now.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	5	If a member of the unit's staff is listening to a current affairs radio programme, does he or she wait until the close of business or does he or she ring the programme manager to tell him or her that his or her Minister or Department is being talked about on Channel 4 or whatever? In other words, is the contact with the relevant Minister or Department contemporaneous? Do the unit's staff wait until the close of business or do they report conversations as they take place in the media about Ministers and their Departments?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	6	To the best of my knowledge, it is done a number of times per day. A summary is provided of the newspapers in the morning followed by a summary of radio and television programmes after lunch and in the evening. It is not compact——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I had occasion recently to come to the Taoiseach's rescue. I will not reopen that now but, as I have been reminded by his backbenchers since, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform asserted that I had done the opposite and had given several interviews over a given weekend saying the opposite. As it happened, I was in Madrid at a meeting of our sister parties. Would the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, have said that because the communications unit gave him wrong information or would he have said it knowing it was not true?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Perhaps it was a flash of inspiration.

Would he have known that automatically from the communications unit or is he reliant only on his Department to keep him informed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I can only assume that, because the communications unit does not open at the weekend, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, must have had some other source for those comments. Perhaps he was listening to the media, but I cannot be sure.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	17	With regard to the other information, an electronic copy is available to more than 100 users throughout all Departments from morning time and if Ministers are abroad, they can get those copies. l have no doubt the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, being the active Minister he is, would have been well aware of what everybody said.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Has it had much of an impact?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	20	This is strange. I refer to the cost of the communications unit. It is possible to obtain the information it provides from the broadcast and print media digitally quite easily without having to listen to programmes one after the other. Is that reflected in the work practices of the unit? Does it have corresponding implications for cost? It seems the information could be obtained much more easily without staff spending 18 hours monitoring the media.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	21	With regard to newspaper reports, I am sure the unit uses the best communications systems available, although I accept that things can be done faster now than in the past. However, the unit does an entire breakdown of the morning news over four or five sheets and it does the same at lunch time. This is convenient, not just for Ministers but also for Departments. If someone wants details of a radio programme, as Departments regularly do, he or she can get the full text.Deputy Kenny asked for the salary and shift allowances of my Department. The amount is €86,023. The shift allowances are paid by my Department. The other costs are €50,428 and the salaries of the seconded staff amount to €177,951, bringing the total cost to €314,402. That is the information Deputy Kenny requested.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997 makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. Such appointments are exempt from the general rules governing civil servants and politics, for example, they can be members of political parties. The appointments are also subject to the Civil Service Regulations Acts 1956 to 1996 and any other Act for the time being in force relating to the Civil Service.Currently the advisers who assist me in dealing with Government business are: Gerry Hickey, programme manager; Joe Lennon; Gerard Howlin; Brian Murphy; and Úna Claffey. Carl Gibney is the special adviser to the Government Chief Whip and Katherine Bulbulia is the programme manager for the Tánaiste. They are both based in my Department.The role of advisers is to keep me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters. Under the direction of the programme manager, their primary function is to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the Government's programme. Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers. They attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities. They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government. In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities in relation to speech drafting. My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis. He monitors and reports to me on the programme for Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That reply deserves careful scrutiny. The Taoiseach read it more quickly than he normally reads his replies.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is the same old reply I have read several times.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	25	One of the important duties of political advisers is to keep the Taoiseach and other Ministers informed and to co-ordinate activities under the Government programme. That seems to coincide with the Taoiseach's ethic of getting in here and staying here.Does the remit of the political adviser — I recall one of the names mentioned by the Taoiseach — include commenting on letters Ministers should sign, arising out of which substantial amounts of money would be allocated for public projects, even when they have not gone through the full system of vetting for qualifying criteria? In respect of a recent project in Kerry, the Taoiseach's political adviser commented that a certain letter was the kind of letter a Minister should see, sign and issue. Arising from that substantial awards were made. I am not commenting on the validity or otherwise of the project. Is that part of the remit of the political adviser?In a case where contracts are being awarded by his Department, does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that his political adviser should sit in on the final interview where a decision is made to determine an award of a substantial amount of public money?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	26	With regard to the second matter, my political advisers would not sit in on the awarding of a contract, unless they were directly involved in the matter. I cannot think of any such case in my Department. In line Departments, it could be the case on issues that are directly relevant. In response to Deputy Kenny's first question, the role of political advisers does not remove the full responsibility for accountability and approval by the normal procedures. A political adviser may meet a group on my behalf or receive representations and could send a comment or a report to a Minister, but that does not remove the legal obligations for adherence to the regulations. That is the way that all issues would have to be processed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	27	In the case to which I referred, because compliance with the regulations was not entirely in line, the structure — for which public money had been paid out — had to be demolished. Is there not a case of double standards? The Taoiseach states clearly that, in his Department, political contacts would not sit on the boards of decision-making interviews, whereas in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister's appointee sat on the board——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The questions refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I understand that, but the question deals with standards in the Taoiseach's Department where a €4.5 million public contract was given to a company. The Taoiseach stated he would not allow this to happen in his Department, but it may happen in other Departments. Does that give the wrong impression to the public? Will the Taoiseach issue an edict that it should end forthwith?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	30	In the case to which Deputy Kenny's first question refers, the individual received a grant on the basis of meeting certain requirements but, when it was brought to the attention of the inspector that he did not comply with the stipulations of the regulation as clearly laid down, a full examination was carried out and the grant was withheld. The procedure was rectified both from the planning and the grant approval aspect and the individual had to reconstruct the building. That shows that the system works effectively. One cannot go outside the stipulations and regulations and that is what happened in that case.In response to the second part of Deputy Kenny's question, which relates to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it was not a political adviser, but the communications officer of the Department, who is responsible for the communications of the Department. While much is being made about who won the contract, the reality is that, whereas McConnell's Advertising Services Limited won the contract, it brought in three other companies and less than a quarter of the contract, as I understand it, is divided between three companies. The issues raised in the House on that are wide of the mark.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	A Cheann Comhairle——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I will call Deputy Kenny later. He has already spoken twice.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	There was still a fair bit left after McConnell's were paid. What is the global cost of the system of political advisers — I do not mean to embarrass any individual — when insurance, expenses and so on are added? Am I correct in presuming that there is now a provision in the public service recruitment Bill that would enable the Government of the day to appoint special or political advisers to posts in the Civil Service? I presume it is redundant to ask the Taoiseach if he thinks that is a good idea since his Government is promoting it, but is it a good idea? From where did the proposal emanate? Did any of the special advisers being discussed in the House now suggest it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	34	If I understand him correctly, Deputy Rabbitte asked about advisers employed by the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government. The cost is approximately €750,000.On the second matter, under the new Bill appointments made by Government under section 13(3) of the 1956 Act, may only be made to unestablished or temporary positions. For the last 50 years they were approved in the public interest. This matter was recently discussed in the House. The appropriate reference in that regard is section 7(1)(e) of the Bill.In addition, under section 5(a) all appointments to established positions can only take place following a competitive process under a code of practice issued by the independent commission for public service appointments. Accordingly, even if the Government wished to appoint its advisers to established positions, which the current Government does not, Ministers would be required to appoint successful candidates only following a competition under the code of practice issued by the independent commission for public service appointments. This would be a major departure from existing arrangements and would mean Ministers could not select their own advisers.Furthermore, the provisions of section 19(2) of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 are not being repealed and will continue to apply. This means special advisers must leave office when the officeholder to whom they are acting ceases to hold office. Such people cannot be appointed as permanent officers.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Will the Taoiseach outline the responsibilities of special advisers towards business of State and, in terms of those in his Department, the work they might undertake for the Fianna Fáil Party?What role did his advisers play in the Fianna Fáil general election campaign of 2002? Will the Taoiseach agree that as his advisers cost €750,000 per annum — €3 million or €4 million during the lifetime of the previous Government — the cost of work done for the Fianna Fáil Party by advisers should be declared and come under the rules regarding spending limits for elections campaigns? Special advisers are governed by the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and are not allowed to carry on functions or professions which conflict with their position. Does the Taoiseach agree that a person no longer employed by his Department can immediately go into private business and benefit from the expertise, in terms of inside information and knowledge, he or she gained? Is the Taoiseach, therefore, in favour of a time limit prohibiting people from moving from such influential positions with inside information into private sector business?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Advisers to all political parties, regardless of which party is in Government, are bound by strict stipulations under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and cannot involve themselves in political activities in the course of their normal work. Such people can be involved in politics but work done for political parties is done outside their normal hours. The rules applying during elections are very clear; such people must cease employment or take annual leave during that period. Most of them cease employment. One adviser, who continued in employment at my Department, was not in any way involved with the last election campaign but was involved in European issues. The rules and procedures in that regard are clear and I have put them on the record. There are always ethical issues involved.For once, I agree with a point made by Deputy Joe Higgins. There should be rules and they must apply across the public service. It is not just a matter of politicians who leave this House after an election or officials who might have worked with Government. The rules should also cover officials leaving Departments or agencies. We need tighter rules in this area and I have requested that the matter be examined. It creates a difficulty.The rules must apply across the board whether the person in question is a politician who left the House after the 2002 general election or an official leaving a political party after an election. That occurs across all parties. While it is easy to focus on the political issue, officials are also involved. In many cases, officials of agencies have greater knowledge of the detail of individual projects and there is an argument for tighter rules. I am not saying it happens, but if people stretch their imaginations they will see the system is open to abuse. It does not make much difference whether a person is working in a Department as an adviser or an official if they subsequently take up employment with a company. While you cannot debar them forever, there should be a period.From a politician's point of view, it would be better if there were a straightforward procedure in place. When a politician is defeated by the will of the people and leaves the House, he or she must find employment. While he or she must do something, we would be better off if there were a straight rule according to which a former politician would have to wait a certain period before taking up certain positions. It is unfair but, if such employment is taken up, there is a suspicion where one is a politician. If one is a senior official of an agency, nobody says anything. I would like to see a rule whereby a bar exists for a certain period across the board. It should not simply apply to former Members of this House whom it is easy to pillory for having been politicians or to political advisers of any persuasion. The rule should be general and monitored by the Standards in Public Office Commission. After a particular period, the barring order would be lifted and one could go back into the system. At the moment, if one is a politician or an adviser, one is jumped on. One could be a much better informed person and no one will say "boo".

If members of the Taoiseach's team are involved in that work, will he inform the House who they are and outline the nature of their activities?I wished to ask the question Deputy Joe Higgins asked. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has admitted there is a problem to be addressed. As he has indicated there is a need to tighten up this area by introducing a code of practice for those involved in political life and advising Government who enter the private sector and who may turn their experience to their advantage and that of whichever clientele they serve and against others competing in the same sector? An unfair advantage in this regard may be real or perceived. Either is cause for action on the Taoiseach's part. Will he elaborate the steps he is considering taking to tighten up this area?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	To reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin's first question, when Senator Mansergh was in my office he dealt almost exclusively with Northern Ireland. The work is now split. A number of my colleagues would be involved in meetings and the preparation and monitoring of the work. My programme manager does quite an amount of this work as do some of my other advisers, such as Joe Lennon, who has been involved on the press side previously and who has a knowledge of these issues. At present he is doing European work but apart from that, he would also have a close interest and involvement in Northern Ireland with the parties involved.In regard to the Deputy's second question, I have looked at this for some time. I am convinced we should do something but on examination of it, my point is that it has to be done for former politicians who have left the House, political advisers and officials as it applies equally to them. When I looked at this a year ago I was looking purely at politicians. That is not fair, it should be a rule in the total sense. We are looking at the legislation relating to lobbying and this matter could be accommodated in it. We have not finalised the position on this matter. However, there should be a fixed period when one is out of one's position, whether as a Member of the Oireachtas, a political adviser, a political staff member working for a party — not a political adviser in a Department but a political adviser associated with it — or an official. It applies equally. It is not as if anybody does anything wrong but there would have to be a period when one is out of one's position. It would not have to be a long period because people have to earn a living and I appreciate that. In these days of being sure to be sure and in order that the system is transparent there should be a period of time.We will have to address that issue. I am conscious that one has to watch people's livelihoods. I could give many examples but I would rather not because that presupposes one is giving rise to suspicion. I will not do that.From the point of view of transparency, one is better off having a period after holding a political, administrative or advisory job before taking up a position with a commercial interest. It happens in every country. I have been trying to do research to see what the rules are but there does not appear to be any particular legislative rule in most countries. It appears as if people leave on a Friday and take up a post on a Monday. Frankly, I do not think that is a good idea. If the Deputy asked me if I would be comfortable with that position, that would give rise to suspicion regarding oneself as an individual if one were to do that. One could be in association with some company and the following day one could be in a different position. As an individual, that leaves oneself open. If there was a rule, people would have to abide by it and nobody could undermine them.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	My figures show a cost for special advisers to the Government of €1.4 million and that the Taoiseach's Department had the highest bill of €517,071 paid out to six political appointees. Are those the correct current figures? In regard to the payments, is it correct to say that the position of special adviser is covered by benchmarking? I understand the  raison d’etre for such advisers is to help ensure the programme for Government is implemented. Is that part of the benchmarking process to which one would have regard in one’s work?The answer to my next question may be "Yes" or "No", but it is a matter of concern. Is the Government in any way liable for the couple of hundred thousand euro being levied against the Taoiseach's appointee as the Government press secretary? Will any of that arise under Government charges? I agree with the Taoiseach that we can all agree in principle that rules are needed in regard to moving from special adviser back into the Civil Service or on to the private sector. However, is the Taoiseach aware of the concern surrounding the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003, in that it is being read in some cases as an attempt by Government to repoliticise the Civil Service in the context of the deletions of sections of the Ethics in Public Office Act, by which means the new Bill will allow for Government political advisers to be appointed to permanent Civil Service positions? Does this concern not need to be addressed? While every case is different, it is remembered that Mr. Frank Dunlop was a Fianna Fáil press officer.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I want clarity on this point because there is concern that, no matter what the Taoiseach talks about in regard to distance, the opposite is happening if one considers the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003, which seems to involve the repoliticisation of the Civil Service.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I have already replied to Deputy Rabbitte on that matter. While it was raised in the House, it is based on a misunderstanding of the legislation. While the 1956 Act could have allowed for appointments to be made, in the public interest that provision is being removed. Government will not, therefore, be able to do that, as will become clear as the Bill goes through the House. I have put the sections on the record as I received them.Deputy Sargent referred to a sum of €1.5 million, but the figure for my staff is approximately €500,000. The costs for my Department, including the programme manager to the Tánaiste and the special adviser to the Minister of State and Chief Whip, amount to approximately €700,000 plus. I am not sure what figure the Deputy is looking at.The matter raised regarding the Government press office is a purely personal one. Any costs or relevant charges are totally a matter for the Government press officer in a personal capacity. No charge applies to the Government.There should be some regulation or rule on the code of practice. In regard to benchmarking, because the salaries are related to grades in the Civil Service benchmarking applies to them in the same way.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I would like the Taoiseach to clarify some of the language he used earlier. In respect of the case in County Kerry, the Taoiseach said a grant was awarded subject to certain criteria. However, the criteria in regard to that case were not even assessed because the political adviser recommended that a particular type of letter be sent from a Minister in respect of which an award was made. I pointed out in regard to the case of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that a political appointee of his sat on an interview board where a decision was made to award a substantial contract. In the context of standards, does the Taoiseach think it appropriate that either a political adviser or a political appointee should sit on an interview board, in his or any other Department, to make such awards? While I am not saying that a political adviser sat on the interview board of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it was a political appointee. Is that appropriate, given the perception of the ethics practised here of getting in and staying in? Is there a difference between the involvement, good, bad or indifferent, of political advisers and political appointees?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Is the Taoiseach saying, in respect of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003, that no special adviser or political adviser may compete for permanent appointment to the Civil Service? While I know the history and what may have happened up to now, I ask the Taoiseach whether any given political adviser is debarred from competing for appointment to a permanent post. Second, the Taoiseach remarked that it would be a good idea to devise some procedures or lay down regulations to debar people across the board, both political and administrative, from lobbying on behalf of whoever they wish for a period after they leave Government service. If he thinks that way, what is stopping him? He has been Taoiseach for seven years. My colleague, Senator O'Meara, introduced a Bill in the Seanad that would do precisely what the Taoiseach suggested but his Government voted it down. Is he now saying he has had a change of heart? I agree with him entirely that a distinction ought not be drawn between a serving politician who loses his or her seat and a political adviser——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	52	People have left the heart of the Taoiseach's Administration and come in the other door as lobbyists. If he is now persuaded that there ought to be regulations in this area, is he minded to support the Labour Party Bill on lobbyists? If I get the nod we will promise to introduce it as Private Members' Business.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The point I made about Kenmare was that while approval was given to the project, that did not override any of the accounting or legal standards which had to be complied with. As soon as the Department found that those were not being complied with, although some appropriate work had been done, a stop was put on the contract.On advisers and political appointments, if someone is appointed to a particular job and a Department is making a decision on a contract, if that person's expertise is in a relevant area I do not see what is wrong with him or her being present. That person does not make the decision. He or she may give his or her views on the decision, but there are procedures for procurement and contracts, and the accounting officer makes the decision. Just because a person has a political responsibility or a political role he or she should not be debarred fully from the decision. He or she should not be the only person making the decision, which is not what happens — the accounting officers must make the decisions.Deputy Rabbitte asked about Governments appointing advisers to established positions. If the Government wished to do so, which it does not, Ministers would be required to appoint the successful candidate only after competition under the code of practice issued by the independent Commissioners for Public Service Appointments.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	54	So the answer is yes.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	55	In that case the person would not be debarred from the normal procedure for appointment to a position.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The House has the impression that the Taoiseach was saying the opposite.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	57	We have gone well over time.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I read that straight and the remaining part states:This would be a major departure from the existing arrangements and would mean that Ministers could not select their own advisers. Furthermore, the provisions of section 19(2) of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 are not being repealed and will continue to apply. This means that special advisers must leave office when the officeholder to whom he or she is acting ceases to hold office.The procedure is that the person must leave but if he or she wants to come back he or she must apply in the normal way, which presumably he or she can do. However, these people cannot just be appointed by an outgoing Minister. Under the 1956 Act one could technically do so but that is being repealed. I do not think anyone ever did so but technically it was possible to do so.The matter raised by the Deputy's last question was discussed in 1995 during the debate on the ethics Act.I remember the discussions. I did not take issue with the decision taken for good reasons by the Government not to provide for this period barring people from such work in the 1995 Act. When we drafted the Standards in Public Office legislation, we had this discussion again and decided not to include this provision. There were many reasons for this but the main one was that, if a politician loses his or her seat in Dáil or Seanad Éireann, or if an officer holder is without a job because of a re-shuffle or if a civil servant leaves on early retirement, he or she has to make a living. There has to be a procedure.Having regard to all the other things we did, a straight period before allowing people to work is a better provision. I agree with the Deputy that it is unacceptable that a politician, political adviser, civil servant or other agent may leave one job to take up another job a week later, having replied to an advertisement or having been head-hunted, and be in a position to deal with a file he or she knows all about from the opposite perspective because he or she has written it. We have avoided it for the reasons——

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	67	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has given its approval to the development of two 500 MW east-west Ireland-Wales electricity interconnectors as a priority. The benefits of such interconnection are clear, both as a competitive tool as well as an alternative capacity source. Interconnection will provide a long-term net benefit to consumers, especially in terms of enhancing security of supply, developing competition and integrating Ireland into a wider European energy market.The next step in advancing this project is to conduct a full feasibility study, examining matters such as submarine cable routing, onshore converter stations and a range of other technical and commercial issues. This is a highly detailed and complex study, which effectively provides a project plan ready for construction. The Government decision will involve the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, being charged with promoting and assessing the degree of interest in the development of merchant interconnectors to be constructed, managed and owned by the private sector.In the event of no substantive interest emerging on the part of the private sector for a merchant interconnector type project, the CER will then move to host a competition for construction, management and ownership of regulated interconnectors, underpinned by a guaranteed regulated revenue stream covering costs, either in whole or in part. Any CER competition arrangements would seek to maximise risk transfer from and minimise costs to the consumer downstream.The Deputy may wish to note that I intend to bring forward proposals shortly for consideration by Government for a Bill to,  inter alia, remove a legislative constraint thereby facilitating a regulated interconnector not owned by the ESB and to underpin any competitive process for regulated interconnection hosted by the CER.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I welcome this announcement and the strong support the Minister has expressed for a 1,000 MW interconnector, effectively two 500 MW interconnectors, which will enhance security of electricity supply by an extra 20%. It will increase competition and move Ireland toward where we need to go in the energy market, namely, to link up with the British grid and, in time and if possible, to create a European electricity grid under which there can be fair and open competition to ensure the consumer gets choice in service provision at the lowest prices possible.The Minister announced that this project will be financed constructed, managed and owned by the private sector. I have no problem with it being constructed by the private sector but I am concerned that infrastructure as crucial as this should be owned and managed by the private sector.Eirgrid manages the Irish electricity grid and it is appropriate that the State should own this infrastructure and pay for it if necessary. A State company, possibly Eirgrid, should also manage it to ensure we can link into the Irish grid as seamlessly and efficiently as possible. I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments on this issue. In this case, the State would also have more control over the cost of interconnection to ensure it is as low as possible so that British power generators could compete as effectively as possible with the ESB and other generators in Ireland to ensure the cost of electricity is as low as possible for the consumer.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I thank the Deputy for his support for the Government decision to move to the construction of two 500 MW interconnectors. In regard to the modus operandi for the construction, and ultimately the management and ownership, the Government decided that we would test the water, through the CER, for any tenders for merchant operation of the interconnectors. It is felt by some sections of the energy industry that there will not be sufficient interest in this respect and, if this is the case, ultimately, the interconnector will be built with a regulated rate of return for the investment in it. The issue of ownership would be determined in the tendering process, which would be under consideration at that time.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Will the Minister acknowledge and give some encouragement to the potential green energy producers, particularly those involved in wind energy, that this interconnector will not only be a source of potential supply of energy coming into the country but a way of exporting green energy, in respect of which we have a competitive advantage with regard to production?What is the timescale for all of this? The Minister's press release states that the project "may get under way by 2006". Is it not possible to fast track this and bring it forward?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	71	This project will be a huge advantage to renewable energy and is one of the main demands of the wind energy sector. Ultimately, we could become a net exporter of energy through this interconnector. In regard to fast tracking the project, this detailed study will be carried out immediately. The estimate for one interconnector was in the region of €9 million to €10 million and I do not anticipate a huge extra cost in that respect. This is the first step. The next step is this major feasibility study which would be a plan for construction. Thereafter, we hope to complete it within the timescale.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 104 together.As the father of young teenagers, I fully empathise and understand the Deputies' concerns over the recent media reports of pornographic images being sent via mobile phones. However, legislation already exists to tackle the problem. It is an offence under section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, as amended by the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, to send by phone any message or other matter which is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. It is also an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to harass a person by use of a mobile phone. I appeal to anyone with information on these matters to bring it to the attention of the Garda Síochána for criminal investigation.The registration of prepaid mobile phones is a complex issue. The design of any pre-registration scheme would be problematic in terms of capturing and keeping up to date the required information because of theft, the cost of maintenance, issues concerning data protection and privacy and ensuring the accuracy of the information supplied. The introduction of a compulsory scheme retrospectively would be difficult given the already high level of mobile phone penetration in this country, which is in the region of three million mobile phones. Of these, in the region of two million, or 70%, are prepaid. The ongoing monitoring and maintenance of any mobile phone register so that the information concerned could be used for a criminal investigation would be difficult. Approximately 80% of prepaid customers' details are registered.My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for policy in regard to the protection of children from the transmission of pornographic images by phones and other media. While, legislation is in place, I cannot emphasise enough the role of parents in decisions concerning both the purchase and use of mobile phones by their children. They should ensure they are used appropriately, which is ultimately the best way to safeguard their children from the perils of abuse of such technology.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The aspect of the Minister's answer that jumps out at one is the fact that 80% of prepaid phones are registered. I thought it was a much lower figure. I am aware that companies encourage people to register by giving them credit and so on. If this is the case, the rest of the argument outlined by the Minister is nonsense. He should ensure everyone is registered.I commend the Minister on making the protection of minors a priority during the EU Presidency. However, he has dramatically failed the young people and children of Ireland in the context of the massive explosion in prepaid phone ownership in recent years, especially among children. As his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, said, given the introduction of 3G technology, it is now possible to have the Internet in one's pocket. Given the recent disturbing cases highlighted by the media of pornographic imagery being sent to children, is the Minister's attitude not too lackadaisical? Should he not introduce legislation, or whatever is necessary, to tackle this issue? I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a role to play. The chief executive of Meteor said recently that updated legislation is necessary. Therefore, the Minister has a responsibility in this area.Will he encourage mobile phone companies to introduce some sort of filtering technology which would enable imagery to be controlled, especially for children accessing the Internet from their mobile phones? Is he happy with the performance of mobile phone companies, especially Vodafone and O2? ComReg recently said these companies have significant market power in this country. In other words, they are a duopoly. They make massive profits from our children and the 70% of customers who have prepaid phones. It is disturbing that companies sometimes use pornographic elements to try to hype their products, as happened in Britain and Japan when companies such as Hutchinson made a deal with Playboy. The Minister must act quickly to introduce whatever legislation is necessary given that just 20% of prepaid customers are involved. People are crying out for this legislation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Each Deputy has a role to play in this regard. Deputy Broughan criticised the companies involved. They wish to sell phones. The Irish Cellular Industry Association meets to discuss all these issues. It is examining the new technology which may be available to filter many of the pornographic images that could be sent over camera phones in particular.People may not be aware that parents can request operators to allow dual access to a child's mobile phone account. They can then monitor who their child is contacting or being contacted by. They can also request that all calls to and from the child's phone are blocked except for a list which they approve for their child. This was as a result of initiatives taken by the ICIA which will conduct an advertising campaign to advertise these services widely soon. This has come about because of the recent controversy.On legislation, while I do not want to be political, I refer to what Deputy Rabbitte said on 22 October 2002 during the debate on the Data Protection Bill. He decried the practice whereby phone companies, etc. are being forced to hold on to the detailed private information to be made available to the men in trench coats who have a penchant for talking up their sleeves. Unfortunately, Deputy Broughan is not rowing in the same direction as his party leader.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	75	It is unfortunate that the Minister is going down the usual political avenue. It is unacceptable for us as legislators to allow a legal loophole to exist which will allow instances such as we saw last week involving a schoolgirl in Cork who was sent pornographic images by phone by a 49 year old man. The Minister said legislation is in place to deal with this issue. Section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 states that it is an offence to send a message that is grossly offensive, obscene or of a menacing character by means of telecommunications system operated by Bord Telecom Éireann.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I understand the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in all this. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has primary responsibility for how markets develop in this area. We should have foreseen these issues. The 3G technology will prove even more problematic in this regard. Is the Minister, Deputy Ahern, therefore prepared to ask the three mobile phone companies to ensure the global code of practice, which they speak about internationally, is put in place? Given what Meteor said and the 20% of customers involved, will he reconsider the need for legislation to deal with the issue?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Is the Minister aware that a considerable industry in this area has developed in Japan because legislators have not responded in the required way? Is it possible for operators to screen such images before they are forwarded to the phones of minors? Does the Minister plan to pursue that avenue with the operators involved?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	86	There is constant contact with the operators in respect of this and other issues. The ICIA is developing a code of practice which will be designed to aid the responsible use of all mobile phones. It is part of the advertising campaign it will conduct.While we might criticise the operators for other reasons, none of the mobile operators in this country offers adult content services, unlike other countries such as Germany, Italy and Holland or Japan, as instanced. We have a good relationship with the mobile operators and they understand this.The mobile operators in this country are examining with their sister companies abroad, especially in the UK, the technology that may be available because this is a worldwide issue. While I appreciate that Deputies will always claim that we need more legislation in this area, the legislation is in place.

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is understood from Deputy Ferris's office that the report to which the Deputy refers is the plan of development for the Corrib gas field submitted by Shell E & P Ireland Limited, formerly Enterprise Energy Ireland, in December 2001. The plan of development describes the route of the onshore pipeline which starts approximately 500 metres from the toe of Barnachuille Hill and which will be trenched to a depth of 1.2 metres along the full length of the route.As stated in a previous reply to the Deputy in October 2003 to a question raised about the landslides on the slopes of Barnachuille Hill at Pollathomais, the proposed pipeline route, which will be located in the floodplain of the Glenamoy river, will be unaffected by any potential instability on the slopes of Barnachuille Hill.As the Deputy is aware, a report has been carried out for Mayo County Council on the causes of the landslides. This report, entitled Report on the Landslides at Dooncarton, Glengad, Barnachuille and Pollathomais, County Mayo, on 19 September 2003, states: "The primary cause of the event at Pollathomais was exceptional rainfall of such an intensity as to overwhelm natural drainage systems in the peat and weathered rock, thereby mobilising sections of overburden through buoyancy and gravitational forces."The report proposes three broad classes of necessary protection works which should be carried out to public infrastructure and adjacent properties. Substantial progress has been made with protection works. Reinstatement of berms and culverts has been completed while works on bridges and roads is forecast for completion later this year.In addition to the exceptional factors, it should be noted that, while the rain fell on the pipeline route, the landslides had no impact on the route. I am advised that the pipeline route is not affected by the uncompleted protection works.On 15 April 2002, approval of the plan of development and consent to construct a pipeline was issued by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, to the developers.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAs part of its examination of the developers' pipeline proposals, my Department commissioned an evaluation of the onshore pipeline design code. This study addressed design methodology, operating conditions, pipeline corrosion, public safety, welding and testing, pipeline material quality and protection from interference. The recommendations of this evaluation were incorporated in the consent to construct the pipeline decision. On 30 April 2003, An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission for the proposed terminal. While a small amount of work was carried out in the offshore in 2002, the project has essentially been parked since October 2002.A new application was submitted by the developers, Shell E & P Ireland Limited, on 17 December 2003 to Mayo County Council. The major change in the new application related to the proposal for the removal of the peat surrounding the terminal to a Bord na Móna bog at Srahmore some 11 kilometres away. On 17 February 2004, Mayo County Council requested further information from the developers.The report submitted to Mayo County Council by a person whose details are supplied is from a Mr. Brian Coyle and is an objection submission to the proposed terminal development planning application. The majority of Mr Coyle's submission relates to planning issues which are for Mayo County Council to address. While he also raises onshore pipeline issues, I am satisfied that all petroleum developmental aspects relating to the Corrib gas field have been and will continue to be addressed.

In reply to a further question on 21 October in which I pointed out the proposed landfall for the pipeline on the south side of Sruwadacon Bay below Dooncarton Hill where the landslide took place, the Minister stated that Shell or Enterprise Energy Ireland had told him that the route would not have been impacted by the landslide.Does the Minister of State agree, as is clear from the detailed report submitted to Mayo County Council by Brian Coyle, a chartered consultant, civil and structural engineer, that if the pipeline had been in place, it would have come under impact from the landslide at landfall with the high possibility of it being severed resulting in extreme human and environmental catastrophic disaster? Mr. Coyle goes further and points to the failure of Shell to comply with the Seveso II directive, which is designed to prevent the consequences of major accidents.

Mr. Coyle's report is in the domain of Mayo County Council to which the planning application by Shell E & P Ireland Limited was submitted. I am sure the report will be dealt with by the council when it makes a final decision on planning permission. The application for permission by Shell E & P Ireland Limited was submitted to Mayo County Council on 17 December 2003. It is still pending decision and I understand that Mayo County Council has written to the company seeking further information. Therefore, Mr. Coyle's report or survey is with Mayo County Council and I am sure it will be dealt with by it.

Particular importance is attached to the ethical behaviour of those appointed to positions of director in these bodies. The code contains an appendix setting out a framework code of business conduct for directors and employees.To provide for greater transparency, I have proposed the introduction of a requirement whereby all those to be appointed or re-appointed to positions of director in the State bodies under the aegis of my Department will be required to produce a valid tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. Existing directors, however, would serve out their terms under the conditions that applied when they were appointed. In addition, I have also proposed the introduction of a provision that all directors of State bodies under the aegis of my Department would sign an annual compliance statement on a personal basis in regard to the code of practice.The Deputy is aware that my Department is not the only one with responsibility for State bodies and, in this context, the Department of Finance has convened a cross-departmental committee to consider the implications for the wider State body sector should this initiative proceed. The Deputy will appreciate that the question of examining a possible independent appointments system for directors of State bodies is one that would require cross-departmental consideration and is more appropriate a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

The number of such companies is 57, which is large. How many directors has the Minister appointed since he became Minister? He mentioned a few months ago that every director appointed would be required to undergo a personal probity test. Of what does that consist? To date, have any State directors under his aegis successfully taken it? He also said he would require tax clearance certificates from directors of semi-State bodies and agencies. To date, has that requirement been applied in respect of any directors he appointed?

That is as far as I can go in this respect.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Can the Minister tell us what the new regime is? Many of us in this House are familiar with taking on the duties of directors, either in private business or for community bodies. We know that since the introduction of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement under Mr. Appleby, and the corporate governance system introduced by the Tánaiste, being a director involves grave and onerous responsibilities. This issue arose under the Minister's remit regarding the disgraceful final reports from An Post last year, after which the Minister said the board had behaved very badly, though he did not sack anyone at that time. Is the Minister now applying these rules to directors of semi-State bodies? What is the Minister's personal view? People have noted in the past that we have had problems with semi-State bodies regarding corporate governance issues because the Minister's party, in particular, appointed a string of political hacks decade after decade. Many problems arose from that.

A key objective of mine is that local authorities should adopt bye-laws for the safe operation of jet skis in their areas of responsibility and, to this end, my Department has been encouraging all local authorities to adopt suitable bye-laws. To date, nine local authorities have done so and a number of others are considering them.A legal issue has arisen regarding the making of these bye-laws in respect of water areas not directly under the control of a local authority. My Department held discussions with officials from the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the matter. As a result of these discussions I intend to introduce a comprehensive legislative package this year to assist local authorities in adopting regulations relating to the operation of jet skis in any waters within their jurisdiction where such controls are required.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am delighted to hear the announcement by the Minister regarding more effective legislation. My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has regularly raised this issue in the House, and there have been a number of serious tragedies relating to jet skis in the south-east and other parts of the country. Is there not a sense of urgency about this matter? On the Fingal coastline in north Dublin, there remain areas where the local bye-laws have not yet come into effect. It is not good enough that bye-laws are in effect only in eight out of 40 major local authorities. Can this matter be expedited, perhaps before the summer?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I assure the Deputy that I am giving high priority to this matter. I want to ensure that as many local authorities as possible have the legislative power to enforce the regulations. As I said earlier, there is some doubt as to whether the local authorities have this power regarding waters not within their direct functional areas. As a result of that, and the advice of the Attorney General, we are expediting this legislation and liaising with the local authorities. We are planning discussions and a forum with them, so as to ensure a uniform implementation of the regulations. We are trying to ensure this is in place for the summer.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The terms of reference for the external review on local radio licensing are to conduct a review of the processes through which radio licences are awarded in Ireland, having regard to comparative international experience, and to make recommendations on the licensing of services in the future. The review will describe current objectives of radio licensing, evaluate whether there is a need to revisit objectives having regard to changes in Irish society and in broadcasting markets, and consider the existing power of the BCI, including the power to decide type of services to be provided and franchise areas.The review will describe and evaluate existing licensing processes, existing roles of the executive of the BCI and of the commission and the need for independent outside expertise in the licensing process. It will explore options for an appeals mechanism regarding licensing decisions.Regarding structure, the review will consider what and who should be licensed, the terms of existing and future licences including duration, the issue of licence roll over, and barriers to market entry. The review will also evaluate existing policy interface. The Department has engaged external advisers to assist in the review, who will shortly submit their final report to me.

We are a very cultural country, but very restrictive regarding specialised radio stations outside Dublin, stations featuring dance music, country music or jazz, for example. This is important, because pirate radio stations are being set up in almost every county, specialising in musical areas such as those mentioned. There are numerous radio stations in Dublin, but very few outside it. Cork is a huge city but has only two radio stations, while Waterford has only just established a second station, Beat FM. The licensing area should be carefully looked at because it is very important.

There is now no radio station for people in Kilkenny, which is a loss, because local and community radio stations are very important to Ireland. I ask the Minister to look carefully at this issue.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I cannot speak about the position of Radio Kilkenny because as the Deputy knows, it is the direct responsibility of the BCI as a result of legislation passed by this House. The Minister has no say in granting or not granting licences to particular organisations. The impression should not be given from this discussion that anything else is the case.As a result of general unease about the fact that decisions were being made without recourse to an appeals mechanism, I specifically asked that that be looked at in this review. At least if somebody is disaffected — there will always be disaffected people in this type of process given the way it is structured at present — they will have, in effect, a second bite of the cherry, and people would welcome that.The difference between Dublin and places outside it is a matter, ultimately, for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland but there is some unused spectrum and one of the issues at which this review will look is whether it can be used. We do not want a situation where we have absolute saturation to such an extent that some of the existing stations would go out of business.

I understand there are 60 stations in Stockholm, for example. Every category of music, current affairs and so on is represented in a city not much larger than Dublin. Does the Minister intend to bring forward legislation on the spectrum? He has made comments over the past six months about these companies making millions of euro out of the sale of licences and the replay of licences. Is he thinking of introducing legislation on the spectrum given that we will soon have the analogue spectrum and so on?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I am even surprising Deputy Broughan with my leftist views. I will be guided by the result of the review which will go out for public consultation so that the public may give its views. Now that we have, in effect, an embedded independent radio sphere — it had to be cosseted to bring it forward — it is high time these issues, such as increasing the number of licences, the appeals and so on, are looked at.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Directive 2002/58/EC, the directive on privacy and electronic communications, was transposed into Irish law on 6 November 2003 by the Electronic Communications (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 2003, S.I. No. 535 of 2003. The regulations provide for restrictions on unsolicited direct marketing by telephone, fax, automated calling systems, e-mail, SMS and MMS.One effect of the transposition was to make it illegal within the EU to send unsolicited commercial e-mail, UCE, to individuals-natural persons. Spam, unsolicited e-mail marketing, sent to individuals, with a limited exception, covering existing customer relationships, is only allowed with prior consent. The regulations also provide for enhanced protection for business users.Monitoring compliance with these new EU regulations with regard to controlling the creation of spam e-mails is a function of the Data Protection Commissioner's office. I have no function in this matter. Recipients of spam originating in the EU can contact the Data Protection Commissioner's office, with whom responsibility for investigating suspected breaches of the regulations lies.Summary proceedings for an offence under the regulations may be brought and prosecuted by the commissioner. The maximum fine on conviction for such an offence is €3,000. The sending of each offending message constitutes a separate offence. Under draft primary legislation currently being prepared in my Department, breach of these regulations and all communications regulations could constitute an indictable offence.Due to the global nature of the problem of spam the solution lies in international co-operation. My Department and the Data Protection Commissioner's office have participated in events at EU, OECD and international levels in a bid to develop a solution. I have raised the matter on a number of occasions at different fora.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	131	It is good to hear progress has been made at European level. Our colleague, Deputy Coveney, brought forward a Bill in the middle of last year and indicated at the time that it would be superseded by EU legislation. However, much of the rubbish which appears on screens does not come from the European Union but from the United States. Recently, we have all been plagued with letters from Africa or wherever telling us that we have just become the guardians of millions of euro and asking us to send back our credit card or bank account number. Has the Department done research on the cost of spam, in terms of time and hassle, to business? Is there a more dramatic initiative the Minister could take at international level, particularly in regard to the United States and elsewhere, to ensure this plague affecting the conduct of our daily business is removed?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	132	We have raised this matter in the EU, the OECD and other fora. Discussions are going on between the EU and the US. It is accepted that this issue will only be dealt with on a worldwide basis. Last week a delegation from the US Congress visited Ireland and we raised the issue with them. They fully accept that whatever regulations the EU brings in will only relate to the EU so, ultimately, this issue will be solved on a worldwide basis. On the cost to business and the community generally, I do not have the information available but there are some estimates. If I can, I will pass them on to the Deputy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	133	What scope has the Minister and his colleagues in organisations like the OECD to take action against portals, servers and major software companies which are gateways for this nuisance?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	134	If one can get agreement at international level, the issue will be enforcement. One must enforce criminal sanctions against the country and the origin of the spam. It is the same here as in the EU. We need to reach agreement worldwide, or at least among the countries from which this emanates, including the US and now, unfortunately, Asia. The step taken at EU level is a small one but it shows how insistent it is in this regard. Our US colleagues were much more reticent about intervening and criminalising unwanted e-mail communication between business given that they have probably the most open economy in the world. They were reluctant to come down too heavily on what they would regard as advertising but which the Deputy and I might regard as spam.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 119 together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised marketplace, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The Information Society Commission published its report, Ireland's Broadband Future, in December 2003. The overriding conclusions of the report are that the market has failed to meet demand in respect of broadband connectivity, and that there is a proven need for Government intervention with a set of measures to accelerate the provision of infrastructure and the driving of demand.An indicative €200 million of Government and ERDF funding was set aside under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for telecommunications infrastructure projects that will enable the provision of modern, high-speed communications by the private sector. The investment covers projects by both the private sector and local authorities, including the 19 metropolitan area networks, which are now being completed and which will begin coming on stream in mid-2004.In December last, I announced my Department's broadband action plan, which will roll out connectivity to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and over, using community broadband exchanges and strategic fibre. A new group broadband scheme, similar to group water schemes, will enable smaller rural communities, for example, communities with a population of fewer than 1,500, to pool their demands and secure high-speed connectivity from a range of service providers, with grant assistance from the Government.This programme will be run in partnership with the telecommunications industry. A spend of €35 million each year from now until 2007 has been committed to the broadband action plan. I have announced new framework deals with Esat BT and ESB Telecom to provide high-speed connectivity to the regions at less than 12% of the cost of the current high-speed connectivity, which has been widely welcomed.Over 40 towns on the two companies' networks will be involved. The pricing of the two complementary offerings is on a par with the best available on the international market, and orders of magnitude below what had previously been available on the Irish market. The offerings will link all regions of the country at low cost and high speed, and will effectively remove the distance-from-Dublin factor, which until now was a considerable consideration for the provision of broadband.Recent figures released by ComReg show the dramatic increase in the take-up of broadband in the past year. Ireland can now boast one of the highest Internet penetration levels in Europe, with more than 50,000 customers accessing the Internet though flat-rate packages offered by Eircom Net and other Internet service providers.There are now more than 32,000 DSL subscribers nationally, compared with 1,000 just a year ago, in March 2003, and the number is increasing every month. Ireland can also boast, at 30%, one of the highest digital television penetration rates in Europe.I recently launched a website, www.broadband.gov.ie, to give information to consumers about these services. The site also allows the public to register their interest in receiving broadband services. I would encourage Deputies on all sides of the House to ensure that all their constituents know about this issue.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	137	If there is anything missing, the Deputy can let me know. It is a good effort to ensure that people know about and are, in effect, able to vote for broadband in their areas. The Government will continue to drive the broadband agenda and aims to have broadband available at bandwidths rising to five megabits to the home in the medium term, as identified in the New Connections document.While the development of the telecommunications market is clearly dependent on the input from a number of players, both private and public, I am confident that the significant investments by Government will give the market a clear signal regarding our aims for improved connectivity, choice and competition.Today, both myself and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, launched an initiative, in conjunction with the four major mobile and fixed-line companies, to bring broadband to 4,100 schools around the country.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome the roll-out of broadband, which is important in attracting business to our country. Is the Minister aware, however, that in some areas there are broadband speeds of only 512 kilobits? In the New Connections policy document, the Government promised to establish a target of 2 megabits. This is way below what was promised. While people are delighted to have broadband it is not living up to the expectations arising from the promises made by this Administration.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	141	This is an issue for the open market, which is a liberalised one. Compared to the March 2003 figure of 1,000 DSL subscribers, we now have 32,000 people with DSL, which is a dramatic increase in a short time. The number of people accessing the Internet though flat-rate packages has gone from zero to 50,000 in a similar time scale. High speed Internet access is available in most regions of the country.

When the Minister's term of office is over, people will look back and say that he missed one of the greatest opportunities in our history. I have been inundated with e-mails from people saying that they have failed the quality test indicator. That test is done on phone lines to see if they can take DSL. I am led to believe that at least 20% — the figure may be higher — of all the home phone lines in this country cannot get DSL because their quality is not good enough. That fact is not on the Minister's website so what is he doing about it?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Perhaps the Deputy should get on to some of his pals in the Communications Workers Union who seem to find fault with the fact that the Minister is intervening in this market.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Will the Taoiseach outline the changes that his Cabinet agreed this morning in respect of the proposals for electronic voting? Will he confirm that a verifiable paper trail will be available to voters who cast votes electronically, so that they will have proof that the machine has carried out their instructions as intended? Will the Taoiseach indicate when and how the independent panel will be established? Will he confirm that if the independent panel recommends a deferment of the proposal because of lack of voter confidence in the proposed system, that recommendation will be accepted and implemented by the Cabinet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The Government discussed this matter this morning, and later the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, will give details of the issues raised this morning——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	155	——as well as some other questions that were raised when he was absent on Government business during the past few days. Because the Minister, Deputy Cullen, was not there last week, we discussed this morning the establishment of the high level commission. We agreed its terms of reference to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the arrangements proposed for electronic voting. The commission will be mandated to operate independently and to present its reports to the Ceann Comhairle who will lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The members of the commission will be appointed within the next few days. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is working urgently on the submission of the heads of the Bill to the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to bringing the Bill to Government for approval and publication as soon as possible.There are many accepted electronic systems in use throughout the world without a verifiable paper trail. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, pointed out before, as I am doing again now, that there will be a formal legal trail audit if one is needed. The system can print a ballot paper for each vote cast, thus enabling a manual count to be conducted if one is required, for example, in the event of a court petition. The Minister and his departmental officials have spent a week consulting all the experts, whose advice is that we are not using the kind of equipment with which this difficulty arose in America. The systems are as different as apples and oranges. It is the experts' professional opinion that this is not required.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Taoiseach's reply indicates the unbridled arrogance of the Government in proceeding with this proposal. The Taoiseach referred to the secrecy and accuracy of the system as proposed. He referred to the advice received by the Minister, since his return from Asia over the weekend, from all the experts. Is the Taoiseach aware that the public perception of what he is doing is of a fundamental alteration of the method of voting that has been the cornerstone of this democracy for 90 years? Fianna Fáil tried to change the proportional representation system twice previously and it was rejected by the people.Is the Taoiseach happy that the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government spent €40 million on this scheme without the permission of the House? Is he happy the current Minister has awarded a €4.5 million contract to a former general secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party?

Are we to take it that the members of the independent panel will be chosen by the Fianna Fáil director of elections? Is that what we are to understand? When will they be put in place? Will the Opposition parties be consulted? Will we have time to respond to their report? When will the terms of reference be made available to the House, as distinct from outside? Is it not the case that the Taoiseach has trampled on the rights of Parliament and ignored the views of his own backbenchers? He has contempt for public opinion and he has repudiated the academic experts who have made clear their concerns about security and verifiability.

What is the hurry with all this? The previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government spent the money without sanction — €40 million. What is the hurry? Can we not have time to work out by consensus of all parties in the House, including the Progressive Democrats, who share the disquiet in the House? Why proceed in this fashion? The Progressive Democrats told us a second party in Government was needed, but it is beginning to look as if there is only one party in government.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The first question Deputy Rabbitte asked was when the system was mentioned in 1999. It was referred to in 1999 and the issue of electronic voting was in the public domain that year. Electronic voting was referred to in two Acts, the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001. The commission will be in place. Its terms of reference are to verify the secrecy and accuracy of the arrangements proposed for electronic voting. It will be set up on a non-statutory basis within a few days. The legislation is being prepared.There are different systems and people continue to compare systems that are not alike. I cannot stop them doing that. However, the system resulted from a major international procurement process. The tender was won by a company that is internationally renowned for having an accurate system for over 30 years. It is a highly credible company. The system has been examined by at least six different bodies, including the German institute, PTB; the Dutch firm, TNO; KEMA, the Dutch firm involved in certification safety; the Electoral Reform System, which ran the functional test to verify the system; an Irish software company, which undertook the architectural and code review; and Zerflow Information Security.The system went through a testing period. It was then rolled out in some constituencies almost two years ago during the general election and then used in further constituencies. It went through the entire process. Complaints were made in the House and I responded by saying we would have an independent examination or group to deal with this. People of the highest repute will be appointed to the commission.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I think that answers all the questions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The Taoiseach is being facetious. It does not. What it confirms is that the Fianna Fáil director of elections will appoint the independent panel. That is what we have established so far. The Fianna Fáil director of elections will appoint the independent panel and draw up its terms of reference. The independent panel, which was committed to be in place before enactment and allowed the facility of judging the secrecy and security of the voting system, will publish a report to which we may then react. Given the schedule for legislation, how does the Taoiseach propose that all that can be processed between now and the local and European elections?What is the hurry? The Taoiseach has made much of conceding the facility for spoiling a vote and a limited tally, both of which are incidental to the concern on this side of the House which is shared by the public, namely, voter verifiability.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	243	My question does not concern the waste of €40 million by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but a cost of €300 million per annum to the taxpayer courtesy of inefficiencies in Government, led in this case by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Newspapers today inform us that taxpayers will foot a €300 million bill for the State's failure to achieve its targets under the Kyoto Protocol.Will the Taoiseach confirm that the figure of €300 million is accurate? If not, what figure would he place on the cost of the Government's failure to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets? While the Government plans to gives free allowance to the high carbon dioxide emitters as long as they continue with business as usual, what will the Taoiseach do about the increasing emissions which will arise from, for example, the 380,000 tonne incinerator to be located beside the Platin cement works, one of the large emitters of CO2? Is it part of Government policy to continue to permit more CO2 emissions and ask the taxpayer to pay for carbon trading or is the Government going to take note of the UK and German Governments which are talking about a 60% cut in CO2 emissions?Will the Government outline how it proposes to contemplate the actions that need to be taken? No decision has been taken on the western rail corridor, high energy efficiency buildings are long awaited, there is a lack of help for people trying to install energy efficient or renewable energy systems and a block on growth in the wind sector. Will the Government revise its policies which go against the Kyoto Protocol so that the taxpayer will not be landed with a bill of €300 million per annum?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Our obligation is to produce our plans and to prepare them, on a voluntary basis, for 2012. The Irish plan will be completed before 31 March. There is no difficulty about that.The national allocation plan for the start of emissions trading for 2005 to 2007 was developed to protect competitiveness and to establish environmental rigour for the Kyoto phase, which is 2008 to 2012. Industry and the power generating sectors will have more rigorous targets for pilot emissions trading during the learning by doing phase, as it is known.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	253	We do not want to go down the nuclear road. The overall allocation to the emissions trading sector will represent an estimated average of 96% to 98% of all expected emissions from the sector, and 95% of the allowances must be made available free by the terms of the EU directive. For Ireland, at least 2.25% of the allocations will not be available for allocation to existing installations free of charge, 1.5% will be retained for new installations, 0.75% will be auctioned to defray the Environmental Protection Agency's costs and any excess of the allowances for new entrants and allowances not issued to installations that close will be auctioned for the benefit of the Exchequer.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Again, I must correct the Taoiseach. The German Government is phasing out nuclear power, thanks to the Green Party in that country. We welcome that. Against the 16,000 MW of wind power there, we have a paltry 160 MW in Ireland. The Taoiseach will have to look at the overall picture and realise that a nod and a wink to Kyoto is not enough. Has he taken legal advice on the climate change national allocation plan? That plan is not just inadequate but it could well be in breach of EU rules that require that all emissions reductions measures are planned and specified and the EU needs to be assured that Government is not giving illegal State aid to large industries by allocating them higher emissions than is consistent with meeting the Kyoto target. The Taoiseach states in his vague reply that the allocation plan for the pilot phase for the Kyoto phase is based on a reduction in these omissions of 1.16 million tons. He continues that the precise mix of additional policies to require this reduction is still to be finalised. When will the Taoiseach outline the additional policies so we will not be landed in legal difficulties regarding the environment?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The plan will be presented before 31 March 2004. Deputy Sargent knows well that all countries in Europe are examining this and taking measures, as we have done, to balance competitiveness and environmental objectives. That is the correct way to proceed. Many industries are moving from oil to gas and taking preventive steps and changing technologies——

The target for the Kyoto phase sets industry a much greater challenge. On the basis of the best available projections, the indicative allocation for the 2008 to 2012 period is estimated to be 83% of the installation space case emissions averaged over the Kyoto phase. Industry will have to make up this shortfall, which is a substantial difficulty for industry. However, Government purchases during the Kyoto phase will only be used to offset emissions in the rest of the economy and will not be made available to industry.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The proposal is that section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 shall continue in force for the period ending on 8 March 2005. The issue the Deputy is raising now does not arise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I am explaining, Sir, why I am opposing it being taken without debate.This legislation was introduced in emergency circumstances at the time of the foot and mouth disease. It is a matter of public interest that there be the kind of protocol that Deputy Kenny has raised for the continued workings of the special investigation unit. Many citizens are making complaints to Deputies on all sides of this House about the absence of such a protocol and for that reason I am grateful for being permitted to say that much.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	276	No. 11 allows the Minister for Finance to introduce measures on Committee and Report Stages that he would not otherwise be able to do because of Standing Orders. There is a large area of disagreement among Opposition spokespersons in allowing the Minister to do this without Opposition spokespersons being given the same opportunity to introduce further measures that have been ruled out of order on Committee Stage. On the grounds that we as Opposition spokesperson should be able to properly assess the Finance Bill, this matter should be debated and decided upon by the whole House and not put through on the nod. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Finance to come in and make those arguments against such a statement in the House rather than rely on the Chairman of the finance committee to ensure the Opposition spokespersons are allowed to make arguments we feel we should make on the Finance Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I will raise with the Minister for Agriculture and Food the point that Deputy Kenny made and I will make him aware of Deputy Rabbitte's point also.On the question of the Finance Bill 2004, financial resolutions, what always happens is that if the Minister for Finance on Committee or Report Stages wants to bring forward an amendment, this provision allows the Minister to bring in a resolution, but that amendment has to be debated. It allows the Minister——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	279	On the Finance Bill, it has always been the practice that if a Minister wishes to bring forward an amendment — admittedly it is being brought in late — it does allow for it. It must still be debated and Members may have a Second Stage debate on it on Committee Stage, as happens regularly on the Finance Bill.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	280	On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to draw attention again to the difficulty for the Opposition if two unrelated matters are taken together in a vote, where there is no debate. In this case there was agreement on one and not the other but the Opposition is forced to oppose both together.

I have a question on the Health Act which concerns the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health and Children. Maternity hospitals have expressed concern about overcrowding as a result of people coming from abroad to have babies here. It is an issue which must be addressed in a balanced and considered manner.

There is an issue to be dealt with and the Government has given it consideration. We will have to come up with a resolution on it. I agree with the Deputy who is aware that substantial numbers of people are coming here. Almost 25% of mothers giving birth in maternity hospitals in the State come here from abroad. They come here purely for the birth before returning to their countries of origin. People can only conclude that this is an issue related to citizenship. We must try to deal with it.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I call on the Deputies who tabled questions to the Minister for Transport in the order in which they submitted their questions to my office.Mr. Naughten asked the Minister for Transport about the circumstances surrounding the accident on Wellington Quay, Dublin, on 21 February 2004; the concerns raised with management of Dublin Bus which may have helped to prevent the accident; the investigations that have commenced and their timescale for completion; the measures being put in place to ensure that such a tragedy is not repeated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.Ms Shortall asked the Minister for Transport if he will report on the investigation being held into the accident in Dublin on 21 February 2004 which involved a Dublin Bus vehicle and left five people dead and many more injured; if a review of the location of or safety procedures at bus stops will be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.Mr. Crowe asked the Minister for Transport if he will report on the tragic events of 21 February 2004 in which five people lost their lives and many others were injured in Dublin’s city centre; the progress of the investigations; and if safety complaints had been received by Dublin Bus regarding the stops on Wellington Quay.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	405	On 21 February 2004, an accident occurred at Wellington Quay, Dublin, which involved a bus operated by Dublin Bus. In the accident, five people lost their lives and a number of others were injured. Like everybody in this House, I extend my condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased. I assure them that a full and thorough investigation is being carried out into the circumstances surrounding this tragic accident. The investigation will be completed in the shortest possible timeframe.The primary immediate investigative role in the case of road accidents is vested in the Garda Síochána. Priority in such an investigation must be given to the determination of the causes of the accident and, in particular, to the determination of whether a breach of the road traffic law contributed to the occurrence. The Garda is the body empowered to make such a determination. Investigations by the Garda into the cause of last Saturday's accident have already begun.Dublin Bus has launched its own company inquiry into the incident to determine its cause and the circumstances surrounding it. The inquiry will be chaired by Arnold O'Byrne, a board member of Dublin Bus, and will include Alan Westwell, managing director of Dublin Bus, Shane Doyle, chief engineer of Dublin Bus, Mick Matthews, operations manager of Dublin Bus, Joe Hogan, risk manager of Dublin Bus, Wolfgang Arnold, engineering and infrastructure director of Stuttgart Transport, Germany, Simon Brown, former group engineer of London Buses Limited, UK, Hugo van Wesemael, former director general of de Lijn Transport, Flanders, Belgium, and Dr. Richard Lambourn, lead investigator of the Transport Research Laboratory, UK. The team will investigate the circumstances of the accident to establish its causes and any contributory factors. It will also make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. It is expected that a preliminary report of the inquiry's findings and recommendations will be submitted to the board of Dublin Bus within six weeks. This will provide an opportunity to assess all the issues arising from the accident, including safety at bus stops.Dublin Bus had received a small number of complaints relating to safety and environmental issues at the stop in question. These complaints related mainly to the night environment in the vicinity of Temple Bar, public lighting, bus shelters, vehicle noise and the pedestrian environment. Since the terminal was relocated to Wellington Quay, there has been no reported incident of personal injury associated with its location. It would not be helpful to speculate at this time as to the causes of the accident. I will await the findings of the two investigations before commenting in detail on the matter. In the meantime, I am assured by Dublin Bus that all reasonable safety measures are in place in the operation of its services. avail of this opportunity to thank the emergency services and the Garda for their speedy response to the events of last Saturday and pay tribute to Dublin Bus for the professional and compassionate manner in which it is trying to deal with this awful tragedy.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	406	This is the worst tragedy in the history of Dublin Bus which has had a good safety record and has improved in recent years. This was an awful tragedy for the families involved, which I saw at first hand on Saturday. I avail of this opportunity to extend my sympathy and that of the Fine Gael Party to the families and friends of the deceased. I avail of the opportunity also to recognise the role of the fire crews, the ambulance service and the Garda who acted swiftly.Will the Minister agree it is critically important that the families are kept fully informed and updated on the progress of both the Garda investigation and the Dublin Bus investigation? Will he agree it is important that the Dublin Bus inquiry is seen to be kept at arm's length from the company? Is it advisable that the Health and Safety Authority and/or public transport user groups have an input into the investigation? What information has been provided to Dublin Bus concerning the safety of the bus stop? Much debate has taken place on this particular bus stop and the location of bus stops throughout Dublin. I acknowledge it is unhelpful to speculate at this point in time until a full investigation has taken place. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I appreciate what the Deputy has said. Every effort is being made by the company and the Garda to keep relatives and everybody else fully informed as the investigations proceed. I do not know if it is necessary to ask that the inquiry by Dublin Bus be at arm's length. There are two parallel inquiries. The Garda is conducting its own inquiry which is the normal procedure in fatal accidents. That is a very thorough investigation and follows the usual procedure. The company has brought in three or four experts from abroad and its process will be entirely transparent. They will deal with it from a company point of view.The Deputy asked about involving the Health and Safety Authority. I presume it can take advice and that it will be offered willingly in this tragic circumstance.In regard to the safety of bus stops, it is not helpful to anybody at this stage to try to draw conclusions as to the safety or otherwise of the stop. The Deputy is not doing that but I have seen it in some commentary. The procedure for choosing bus stops has existed since 1961. Ultimately the Garda determines the location of a bus stop by a statutory notice. It does that in consultation with the bus company and the local authority. The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the transfer of that authority to a local authority some time in the future. That has not happened and that point of view has not been considered just yet. The law since 1961 to the present day is that the Garda makes that determination. It does so after an assessment of the safety aspect. I am assured by the Garda, the company and the local authority that the normal procedure for this particular location was fully gone through. There are standard procedures which had to be gone through. As a result, the Garda approved the location of the stop. There are many similar locations around the country, all of which have come through the same procedure.I spoke with the Garda Commissioner a few hours ago. He assured me he has dedicated a substantial number of personnel to the case and said many people had come forward. He wanted to thank those who are being interviewed. He indicated to me that one witness had confirmed that the driver was in the seat of the bus that went forward. The Garda regards that as a very useful piece of confirmation. He pointed out that the interviews with the bus drivers which have taken place are preliminary and that full interviews will take place as soon as possible. Until such time as those interviews are concluded it is not expected that we will get a clearer view of what precisely happened.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	408	On behalf of the Labour Party I express our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of those who lost their lives on Saturday and those who are seriously injured. Our thoughts are with them and the staff of Dublin Bus who were involved and their families.I wish to be associated with the expressions of appreciation for the work of the emergency services in very difficult circumstances on Saturday and the admirable way in which Dublin Bus has handled this difficult and tragic situation. Dublin Bus expects a report from its investigation in about six weeks. When does the Garda expect to be in a position to complete its inquiries and to report to the Minister?I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the manner in which he will deal with releasing that information to the families. When they have buried their loved ones, their priority will be to find out exactly what happened. It is of the utmost importance that they be told as soon as possible the outcome of those investigations.Since this incident on Saturday, I have had correspondence and calls from members of the public expressing concern about safety issues, including Wellington Quay, and other locations where bus stops, temporary bus stops, or temporary termini have been relocated as a result of the Luas works and various other construction works around town, including those on O'Connell Street. What are the criteria used for identifying locations for temporary or permanent bus stops and termini? We all appreciate the difficulties in finding a location. Can the Minister establish the criteria used by Dublin Bus, the Garda and Dublin City Council in identifying locations? As a result of the tragedy on Saturday and concerns raised in the public arena since then about other locations, will the Minister arrange for a safety audit to be carried out on all bus stops and, particularly, termini in the Dublin city area to ensure that, as far as possible, every effort has been made to ensure other tragedies do not occur in the difficult situation in the city centre?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Certainly I will ensure that information is made available to the families in a sensitive and timely manner, whether from the company or the Garda. I know they will do that in any event but I will ensure it happens in a delicate and timely fashion. I do not know the timescale of the Garda inquiry in these matters. The Garda Commissioner assured me he has assigned a significant number of the force to this inquiry. Therefore, I expect good progress. As soon as the interviews with the drivers are concluded we should have a better view of what happened.I have explained the criteria about the location of bus stops. It is a routine matter which goes on day in, day out. The local authorities, the Garda and the company discuss, almost on a daily basis, where bus stops should be located. The criteria used will be in regard to space, safety, patronage, the type of traffic in the area and similar issues. The Deputy rightly points out that the road space available often limits the options available to them. However, I know that the three authorities make every effort to put bus stops at very safe places.I do not want to comment on the accident other than to say that the relevant diagrams and charts of what happened suggest it was unique in that a particular bus ended up on the inside of another bus when there was, apparently, only five or six feet between the stopped bus and the footpath. I have never seen anything like the unique situation detailed in the diagrams. The great unanswered question is why that second bus apparently found itself moving along the inside of a parked bus, with people on the left, and, in the course of that, causing such awful trauma and tragedy. It is unique and I will have more information when investigations are concluded.I want again to be associated with thanks to the gardaí, accident and emergency services, ambulance personnel and members of the fire brigade who did a difficult but magnificent job. Dublin Bus was also tremendous. It appointed a dedicated person for each family involved and contacted and provided counselling for families. It has confirmed it will cover all necessary medical expenses and deal with the financial issues urgently and in a caring manner, and I thank it for that.I am aware that bus drivers availed of counselling services over the weekend. It was a traumatic experience for other members of Dublin Bus who either observed the scene, heard about it or know those involved personally, and I thank them also.

In particular, I pay tribute to the emergency services and Dublin Bus. A number of questions have been asked. As to whether it is unhelpful to discuss the location of the bus stop and so on, as the Minister stated, the media are running with many stories in regard to complaints about the location from Leixlip councillors to Dublin Bus. The Minister rightly states that we are concerned about the accident and do not want a reoccurrence. However, many listening to this debate or travelling home this evening to their families and friends want reassurances from the Minister that everything in his power will be done to ensure that a similar accident does not occur.While the Minister says he is fully supportive of safety measures, which we all accept, does he not accept that many people see a contradiction in the sense that, on the one hand, we are talking about safety and, on the other, the budget for public transport safety was cut back by 28%. I am not trying to make a political point but people are worried and do not want a reoccurrence of such an accident.As regards public safety, the Railway Safety Bill--——

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The question concerns what the Minister can say or do to reassure the travelling public that a similar accident will not occur. Can he give assurances that he will do his utmost in this regard and, if it is a matter of spending more money, that more will be spent? Can the Minister reassure the public, in particular those who travel on buses and their families?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Dublin Bus has an absolutely marvellous safety record. Findings from the UK in regard to accidents involving buses and coaches on urban roads show a rate of 4.3 fatalities per 100 million vehicle kilometres. The average for Dublin Bus over the past five or six years is 2.6 fatalities. Even one accident or fatality is too many but, by international standards, Dublin Bus has a marvellous safety record. That is the best assurance I can give.In regard to this case, the driver principally involved in Saturday's crash had 20 years' experience. I can confirm to the House that he had clear blood and urine samples and had been fully rested before going on duty. Dublin Bus is a very safe company with high training standards, into which it puts much time and effort. The complaints about this particular stop referred mostly to the night-time environment, public lighting, noise and pedestrian access, rather than its precise architecture.

It is critically important that those appointed to liaise between the families and Dublin Bus keep the families updated on the progress in regard to both investigations. While the focus of the families over the coming days will be on the burial of their loved ones, after that they will want answers and it is important they are kept updated. I ask the Minister to ensure this is done on an ongoing basis rather than having them wait until the end of the investigations.Will the Minister ensure that a copy of the Dublin Bus report, when complete, is presented to the Oireachtas committee on transport? Will he give a commitment to the House that any recommendations which come from the Dublin Bus or Garda reports will be implemented by Government as swiftly as possible so that we can ensure there is not a similar incident in future?

I appreciate that they want answers and, in particular, I take the Deputy's point that they should not have to wait until the end of the inquiries but should be kept updated on an ongoing basis. I will discuss that with the Garda and Dublin Bus to ensure it happens, as it should. The Dublin Bus report will be published as soon as it is completed. Recommendations which come forward will, of course, be implemented.

I commend the emergency services and the staff of Dublin Bus on the manner in which they reacted at the scene of the accident and since then, which is to their credit in tragic and difficult circumstances.There are genuine concerns in regard to traffic safety issues on the Quays in Dublin and the one-way system throughout the city centre. Questioning and discussion on that would be better served on another day and, therefore, I will not deal with general issues regarding speed on the Quays and elsewhere.The committee which Dublin Bus set up to investigate this incident does not include a representative of Dublin City Council, which might have been wise given that the city council is responsible for the design of the street and traffic management. While we do not know the particular circumstances of this accident, does the Minister consider it would be wise for a city council official to be active on the committee, so that traffic management and road design issues are taken into account when the committee is carrying out its work. It might be a step in the right direction.

The company has decided, at my request, to have its own company investigation and it has brought in overseas experts to assist with that investigation. It is as well to leave them to carry out their inquiry and publish their findings alongside the Garda investigation. That is more appropriate. The company will of course have to consult fully with the city council, the Health and Safety Authority and any other agency which needs to be consulted. It is not that I have any objection to the involvement of the city council or the Health and Safety Authority; it is quite the opposite. Those bodies will be consulted and could be very helpful but it is more that Dublin Bus, with my support, wishes to have its own inquiry into what happened with its buses.

There has been significant disruption of bus services in the city and I have had many complaints from people since Saturday about the condition of various bus stops around town. Calls to radio programmes bear out those complaints, as do photographs in today's Irish Independent which show the precarious conditions in Middle Abbey Street, with people queuing for buses between builders’ barriers.Will the Minister consider reviewing the safety criteria used by the Garda, the city council and Dublin Bus when selecting locations for bus stops given the tight situation in town? Will he also arrange a safety audit of those city centre stops which have been moved on a temporary basis? Perhaps he should look at the possibility of additional safety measures, such as barriers, in order to cater for temporary arrangements which are potentially dangerous.

I laid out those criteria earlier and I will ask the Department of Transport to review them, which is something we should do in the normal course of business.On the issue of an audit, I will ask the various agencies to satisfy themselves that existing bus stops are within safety limits. The Deputy knows that all over the country there are situations which could be improved, such as narrow streets with heavy traffic, including buses and trucks with big wing mirrors sticking out at the sides. When people all over the country saw this accident they probably thought of other dangerous places. I will ask all the agencies to review the locations and to satisfy themselves that the original decision to sign off on those locations still holds from a safety point of view.I want to do this in a spirit of common sense so that those agencies can reassure themselves that their original decisions were good rather than doing so from the perspective of a major investigation. I do not want to alarm people. Current bus stop locations have gone through the process I mentioned and have been deemed safe, but with increasing traffic and narrow roads in certain areas, everyone must be continually vigilant.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	420	While this appalling tragedy occurred at a bus stop and might be considered a freak accident, does the Minister agree that it raises the question of the safety of thousands of pedestrians on crowded sidewalks in busy parts of Dublin and other built up areas around the country? This terrible event happened at a bus stop, but does the Minister agree that in a situation where one has fast-moving traffic — trucks, buses and cars — moving one or two feet away from crowded footpaths, with no protection for pedestrians apart from a raised sidewalk of a few inches, there is the potential for similar or worse tragedies occurring at any time? Does he agree that the new features coming to Dublin's streets, Luas and on-street trams, unfortunately mean more hazards for pedestrians? Does he agree that the question of the safe separation of areas frequented by large groups of pedestrians, particularly sidewalks, from fast-moving traffic is a very urgent matter? Will his Department give this problem urgent consideration with a view to action?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The Deputy raises issues which concern us all. I am sure there are many locations around the country where people are worried about their safety. The Deputy echoed my comments on the extent of traffic and the significant increase in the number of vehicles in the country. Some design features on these HGVs and buses, such as extended side mirrors, combined with narrow streets and the fact that everybody is rushing around, mean that there will always be dangerous situations.In response to Deputy Shortall, I have undertaken to ask the Department of Transport to review the safety criteria for the location of bus stops and whether it is still satisfied with the criteria used to choose those locations. Pedestrian fatalities are increasing, which is worrying, particularly the number of such fatalities among road death figures. Analysis of any period, whether one month or six, shows a growing trend of pedestrians being injured as opposed to the head-on car crashes on country roads that we used to think of. I am conscious of this and we will review this matter in as far as we can with the Health and Safety Authority and the various other agencies.I also take the point about Luas, which will be another consideration. The Luas will be passing every five or six minutes and people will have to be vigilant. We will make every effort to inform them about the safety aspects of Luas and I take the Deputy's point.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:2.—Insofar as additional payments are made to the Local Government Fund by virtue of this Act which, but for this Act, would not be made, such payments shall be applied to the construction, repair and maintenance of tertiary roads.The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the increases in motor taxation provided for in this Bill will be ring-fenced for use in the repair, maintenance and construction of tertiary roads. Most of these roads are of the sort one typically finds in housing estates and, as I said on Committee Stage, are the most neglected in the country and are getting little attention from the Government. In response to my raising the issue last year, the Minister engaged a firm of consultants at a cost of approximately €750,000 to carry out a pavement study. This is daft idea because most local authority engineers are perfectly capable of giving the Minister a list of the tertiary roads which are in an unsatisfactory condition or in need of repair or reconstruction. I am baffled as to why it is necessary to engage a firm of consultants to carry out this study for the Government.The reason is that local elections are coming up in June and the Minister knows that when his colleagues, who will be candidates for the Government parties, face the people living on these roads and using them every day, they will be asked why they are in such a state of disrepair and what will be done to fund their repair and reconstruction. The Minister's reply to his colleagues on this issue will be that the Government is carrying out a study on the issue to be completed in August after the local elections in order that no commitments can be given or extracted in advance of 11 June. I want a commitment from the Minister that these roads will be attended to.Some time ago, the funding allocation for non-national roads was announced, at which time I asked questions, the answers to which I am still waiting for. I am sure Waterford city and county deserve every euro which has been allocated to them under the non-national roads allocations for 2004. The allocation to Waterford city is €10,637,000 and to the county is €10,293,000, which is a total of nearly €21 million. That notwithstanding, I do not understand why the entire city of Dublin gets approximately half the total allocation which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government allocated to his own constituency. The allocation for non-national roads for Dublin city is €11.5 million.Will the Minister of State explain why the entire city of Dublin gets just half the allocation which is being made to Waterford city and county or why the urban road authorities were allocated only 12% of the total allocation made under non-national roads. In these allocations I detect a bias by the Government against urban areas, which is reflected by the Government's failure in recent years to allocate sufficient money for the repair and maintenance of tertiary roads — the types of roads in housing estates about which I have been talking.The Government is giving the two fingers to the overwhelming majority of the payers of motor taxation who live in the areas from which the NRA is getting the least amount of money and we need to see a remedy to that situation.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Before we decide on this amendment, will the Minister of State clarify if this money will be ring-fenced? I know it is being ring-fenced for spending by local authorities but on Committee Stage I observed that this money could be spent on such items as administration and other matters not directly related to the repair of roads, never mind the repair of the tertiary roads to which Deputy Gilmore refers in his amendment? Will the Minister of State assure us that this money is absolutely ring-fenced and will not be spent on the administration of any aspect of local government or the collection of road tax? If the money is not directed at new projects in local authority areas, the 5% rise in motor vehicle taxation is a new form of direct taxation, despite the promises made to the contrary in the programme for Government. In what way can local authorities disburse the money which will be raised as a result of the 5% increase in motor taxation?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment. How does the Minister of State describe this tax increase? Would it be fair to describe it as yet another stealth tax imposed on motorists? Does he agree that it is just another brick in the wall of an inequitable tax system which is affecting the poorest people most, while the better off can afford accountants for their systems of tax avoidance and evasion? What will motorists get for this 5% increase? I suspect it will be more bumper-to-bumper gridlock and more five mph crawling, as businesses wait for people to get to work. I wonder if that is fair. At more than double the rate of inflation, how can this 5% increase be justified at this time?In addition to the charges through the tax system, motorists are suffering from parking charges, clamping and so on, all of which would be fine if motorists had an opportunity to leave their cars at home. Unfortunately, for people in rural Ireland that is clearly not the case and people are obliged to have a car and incur massive costs through insurance. These people are having that expense heaped upon by this 5% increase. In virtually any town, motorists experience excessive parking charges. Can the Minister of State justify any of this because people in rural Ireland have no option but to use private transport which is grossly unfair? I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	426	On Deputy Gilmore's amendment and ring-fencing for tertiary roads, as I said on Committee Stage, the amendment proposes to give primacy to tertiary roads in the context of extra revenue generated by the increases in motor tax set out in the Bill. I cannot accept the amendment as it would give statutory priority to a particular class of road. This would set an unwelcome and inflexible precedent. The non-national roads effort is based on a whole network approach which is bringing about quantifiable improvements to the network. I refer the House to section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, which places a legal responsibility on local authorities for the maintenance and construction of regional and local roads in their areas.I do not believe it would be in the best interests of the road network as a whole to accept an amendment which would give priority to one type of road. That does not mean I do not sympathise with the efforts of Deputy Gilmore. Each Member of the House would take the view that more funding should be provided for tertiary roads, which make up almost 25% of non-national roads. This would be inflexible and it would interfere with the local democratic decision-making process currently operated by local authorities.As I outlined on Committee Stage, the overall length of non-national roads is almost 87,500 kilometres, just over 20,000 of which are local tertiary roads. I acknowledge that 25% of the overall fund does not go towards these roads. The amendment, if accepted, would give absolute priority to local tertiary roads, which make up 23% of the national road network. The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in the various areas is a matter for each local authority. Such works are funded from authorities' own resources, supplemented by the State grant from the Department. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects or works to be carried out under the various non-national road grant categories is a matter for local authorities.The House will be aware that the restoration programme, which has been in place since 1995, aims to restore all regional and local roads which were deficient in 1996. We hope to have the work carried out by the end of 2005. The programme has been undertaken on foot of a multi-annual restoration programme prepared by councils and submitted to the Department. The local authorities are best placed to determine the priority to be accepted under the multi-annual programme.There was a debate on the issue 12 months ago during the debate on the Motor Tax Bill. At the time, I indicated that a new pavement conditions study on national roads would be carried out under the pavement management system which commenced in 2003. This is just the second such study to be carried out. I believe we will get value for money. It is a question of inviting an independent company to carry out the study and to make recommendations. The purpose of the study is to ascertain the extent of deficiencies in the network. It will examine each class of non-national road, including tertiary roads.I am not anxious at this time to introduce legislative rigidities or inflexibilities into the funding programme for non-national roads. I assure Deputy Gilmore that local tertiary roads will continue to receive attention into the future. Perhaps the recommendations which will come from the new pavement conditions study will recommend additional funding. We will look carefully at the recommendations. It is coincidental that the results of the study will be available in August 2004. On this side of the House, we are proud of the record allocations provided in recent years. Anyone who looks at this objectively will take the view that there have been vast improvements.I am not defending the case in regard to tertiary road. On Committee Stage, reference was made to CLÁR funding. While funding is being provided, it does not resolve Deputy Gilmore's problem. I know he is looking at the bigger picture and not just his constituency. We are taking the matter seriously. It will be with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs who will concentrate on class 2 and tertiary roads. This is an indication of our commitment in CLÁR-funded areas, which is not the whole country. I hope the situation will change as a result of this. I assure Deputy Gilmore that, together with the Minister, I will give the matter my personal attention. It amounts to 23% of the national roads network and it is important to the citizens who live along these roads.Deputy McCormack raised the question of additional funding. We expect to raise the extra €34 million as a result of the increase of 5%. Every cent of the extra revenue generated by the increase in rates will be spent on non-national roads. The Deputy may have taken the view that all the €34 million will not go into roads. Of course, administration will be involved, but I estimate that practically all the money will be spent on roads. It should not result in any great overheads within local authorities. I will be disappointed if all the money does not go into roads.On Deputy Morgan's point, the additional funding will be €34 million, which will be totally ring-fenced. It will go into the local government fund and will be spent entirely on the local roads network. This is not just the State grant allocation, there will be additional funding from the local authorities own resources. I made the point on Committee Stage that in future we will be very vigilant with a view to ensuring that local authorities maintain their levels of funding and increase their contributions by way of increases in line with inflation. The overall funding of €477 million provided by the Department is made up of €428 million from the local government fund and €48 million from the Exchequer. We are ahead of our projections on expenditure not just in the BMW region, but throughout the east and south. We are almost 15% ahead of the profile which has been established.Deputy Gilmore asked about the allocation of €10,637,000 to the city of Waterford and €10,293,000 to the county as against €11.5 million to Dublin city. There was a significant increase in the allocation to Waterford city in 2003 due to an increase in the strategic non-national roads grants in 2004. Allocations for these grants can vary from one year to the next. As far as I am aware some major works in Waterford city were required to be carried out. I refer to the Tramore ring road. There was also the outer ring in Waterford city, which does not qualify for National Road Authority funding as it is a non-national road. It was a job that had to be done. I have no doubt that many other town councils and corporations require this type of funding. That was a job that had to be done and I would not attach any great significance to it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I thank the Minister of State for answering the question on the comparison between Dublin city and the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Cullen. I am not drawing any conclusion from it but simply drawing attention to the conclusion that the taxpaying motorists of Dublin are likely to draw about where they rank in the Government's list of priorities when it comes to the allocation of roads money. No doubt the Minister of State's colleagues who will contest local elections across Dublin city in June will hear much about that. All I can do is pass on to them the Minister of State's explanation. They may say it is fine to provide a ring road for Waterford, but they may wonder about the road improvement schemes for which they have been waiting for years and where they rank in the Government's list of priorities. I am not drawing any conclusion; I will pass on to motorists the explanation the Minister of State has given and they can give their verdict on it on 11 June.The Minister of State did not reply to my second question. He might give an explanation in that regard which equally I will be happy to pass on to the people concerned. The urban areas only got 12% of what was described as the biggest ever allocation of non-national road money for 2004. Can the Minister of State explain why the authorities in urban areas, I include all the cities and towns which have urban authorities, were given only 12% of the allocation.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the administration aspect. It was raised on Committee Stage and perhaps even on Second Stage that some of this money would go towards administration, expenses, wages, travel, etc. In respect of every job a local authority takes on, it has to allocate some of the grant towards the cost of implementing it despite the fact that the people who deal with such work are paid on a full-time basis and their wages are provided for in the Estimates. I hope none of the grant goes towards paying the benchmarking awards. The Department left local authorities short of funding to meet the payment of those awards. The authority in County Galway and Galway city was left short of more than €3 million to meet the increase in payments in respect of benchmarking, for which no provision was made at any level by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Has a local authority that was allocated, say, €34 million a free hand in drawing up a plan for the spending of that money? Will an audit of its spending be carried out at the end of year? Will any official report on such spending to us, the people who are passing this legislation, which will crucify the motorists by imposing a 5% tax increase on top of all the other increases they have to bear? Will the spending of such money be reported to us or the Government, or will an audit of local authorities be carried out to outline where this money was spent? That is an important question we will have to answer as public representatives. If we have to sell this measure, as we and Government party councillors in particular will have to do so during the local elections, such reporting is necessary. I want an answer to that question.I am very pleased to know about the grant aid of €20 million that was allocated to Waterford, and fair dues to the people there. Has any money been allocated to construction work on the outer bypass road in Galway city? We are talking about city authorities in the context of this amendment which relates to tertiary roads in city areas. Has any money been allocated for park and ride facilities which would help to reduce the number of cars in cities and represent a move towards keeping them traffic free?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The Deputy said he would give his constituents an answer, but I am sure he would be the first to tell them that in the case of the authority in Dún Laoghaire, the allocation increased from €8 million to €16 million between 1999 and 2001. Perhaps people in other urban areas wondered why that authority should have received a doubling of its allocation in that period. There must have been a demand for it and works must have had to be carried out. The authority in Waterford was not the only authority that received an increase in its allocation. Schemes in other areas that will benefit from the record allocation of 2004 include the Naas ring road, the Enfield-Edenderry road, the Castletroy distributory roads, the Trim-Dublin improvement scheme, the south Dublin outer ring road, the Wicklow town relief and port access road and the outer ring road in Waterford. There is a demand for such road works.Deputy Gilmore referred to some authorities receiving only 12% of the allocation, but allocations cannot be given purely on a pro rata basis. If they were, we would be talking about an allocation of 12% for roads in urban areas. If the allocations were made on a pro rata basis in regard to road mileage, the tertiary roads would not be a problem for us in that 23% of the funding would go towards them. Many other factors have to be taken into consideration. Waterford benefited this year and other counties will benefit another year. However, many other areas also benefited this year. A scheme in my county to upgrade the famous back of Errigal road, which is supported by all parties, was allocated €15 million over a number of years and an allocation of €700,000 was made this year to complete that road. At times, it can seem that allocations to authorities are skewed, but there are times when some local authorities will benefit more than others.I am sure the allocation for road works will be apportioned to the various schemes. The local government audit service prepares a report. The most recent Act introduced a local government local audit, similar to that of the Committee of Public Accounts. The local government audit service prepares a report each year, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.

It never ceases to amaze me that when asked a question, Ministers will reach for the millions. I asked the Minister of State a simple question, namely, to explain to the House why the urban authorities got only 12% of the non-national roads money allocated this year. Maybe there is an answer, but the Minister of State said that various authorities got so many millions, and a new relief road was built in south Dublin, and so on. That is not the answer. We know all that. The question was why urban authorities fared so badly in the allocation of money, and it has not been answered. I am not at all satisfied with the response by the Minister of State.

When we are sent to this House by people to act on their behalf, scrutinise this legislation and put forward our amendments, it is disappointing that we do not get earlier notice of their disqualification. More reprehensible is the fact that they are not allowed to be debated on the floor of the House, because I thought this is what it is all about. I am learning fast that perhaps it is not. I appreciate the point made by Deputy Gilmore regarding the avoidance of answers by Ministers. Performance in that area leaves much to be desired.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I will return to decentralisation. I have a few things to say on that matter, and on the role of the Minister of State in it. The quality of our public service is something we can be proud of in Ireland since independence. Over the decades, some very high-calibre people have served in it and done the country proud. Even in these scandalous times, incidents of corruption among public servants have been extremely rare. A great deal of the credit for this is due to the institution of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. The high quality of civil servants was due as much to the development of a cadre with service-wide standards and often service-wide experience as to the educational level of those recruited.For eight decades, there has rarely been a hint of concern that recruitment might have been influenced by political considerations. The twin pillars of this record of ability and political independence have been the development of a professional career Civil Service and the presence of the Civil Service Commission. Clearly, in the new scheme of things, they must go, presumably because they are old-fashioned, standing for the values of public service rather than commercial glitz or political graft.First, we had the ill-thought-out announcement on budget day that the Civil Service was to be fragmented into pockets in all regions, making the idea of interdepartmental transfer all but impossible. Now we have a Bill which would do away with the Civil Service Commission. What would it put in its place? The answer is two bodies sharing some of what the commission has been doing so well. One would set standards, the "codes of practice" as they are called, which would replace the regulations made by the commission, while the other would enforce those standards and do some central recruitment itself.The first body, a new commission, would also license individual public service bodies including Government Departments, to do their own recruitment. It is difficult to think of a reason to replace the Civil Service Commission with two bodies unless it is to disguise the fact that much of the recruitment will be done in future by the Departments themselves or by private agencies acting on their behalf. If there were to be a continuing pattern of central recruitment to the Civil Service, surely the commission, whether it is called the Civil Service Commission or by the new name of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, could set standards and carry out some recruitment as it currently does.Why the extra layer of bureaucracy, and why must the commission and the board of the new public appointments service, as proposed, be so big? They are both to have a much larger membership than the three-person Civil Service Commission at present. Is this to give the Government a chance to have greater influence on recruitment by nominating reliable political stalwarts to serve on these bodies? Why was it felt necessary to highlight the possible business which recruitment agencies might get from this change by specifically providing in the Bill for their involvement? There are some excellent recruitment agencies but there are also many agencies which add limited value to the selection process. It will be said this is why the Bill must provide for approving or listing them if they are to be so used. However, the Bill, in section 27, for example, is vague about the criteria to be used in listing agencies. The only criterion specifically mentioned is that it must be tax compliant.It is impossible not to have serious concerns about the intentions behind this Bill and about the effects it will have. The result will be a more fragmented Civil Service, more closely tied to individual Ministers and lacking the esprit de corps which has been its hallmark up to now. Perhaps that is the intention behind it. Indeed, what other conclusion could be drawn when the Minister who boasted that the soon-to-be dispersed civil servants would be welcomed to Parlon country is the same Minister the Government chose to present and defend its vision of the Civil Service of the future?In many ways, this Bill will undo much of the reform introduced in recent decades. A significant part of that reform has been the opening up to staff serving in other Departments of promotion opportunities in cases where they are confined to civil servants. The top level appointments committee was perhaps the most high profile of these initiatives, but it was also significant in its impact at lower levels. Badly planned decentralisation, coupled with local recruitment, would reverse this trend. There is a need to have greater flexibility than in the past and Departments must have a greater say in recruiting their own staff, but we should not effectively change the concept of general service grades by turning them into local departmental groups with just a common title.In short, this is a bad Bill and it should be opposed. Even if a change in this direction is forced through, at least let us make sure that a bottom line is not eroded. That bottom line has to be to preserve the Civil Service Commission in character and function, if not in name, to keep political hands off the business of recruitment to the public service and not to lose the concept of a single professional career Civil Service.I return to the point I was addressing when the debate adjourned last week, which is that it was necessary for each Department to carry out a risk assessment of the decentralisation proposals announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. I stated then that I had tabled a number of parliamentary questions addressing this issue and a number of other aspects surrounding the decentralisation plan. I just received the replies and I have not yet had an opportunity to examine them in detail. However, skimming through them, there seems to be a pattern in the replies I have received from many Ministers which is essentially that the Department is awaiting the pronouncement from the implementation committee headed by Phil Flynn or that it has established some implementation group of its own and that until these implementation groups report, it will not be in a position to carry out an assessment of the risks involved. That misses the whole point.On budget day the Minister for Finance announced that a number of Departments were to be decentralised, lock, stock, and barrel to a number of locations and that, in some cases, the Departments were to be broken up and decentralised to different towns. It is necessary that a risk assessment is carried out of that proposal. Where a Department knows it is to be decentralised in toto, where it knows, as Departments do, where the locations will be and where it knows that its functions are to be decentralised to a number of locations, it is possible to carry out an assessment of the risks that poses to the functioning of the Department, its strategic objectives, finances, personnel and efficiency. It is something required of Departments to carry out, a point to which I intend to return when I have had an opportunity to study the replies in detail. It is as much a requirement for Departments to carry out an assessment of the risks of these plans as it is to have carried out an audit of activities undertaken in the past. It is not something which comes after the implementation groups have made their reports or recommendations as to how the decentralisation is to be carried out in practice.Once the Departments know the Government decision and the shape of the decentralisation, there is a requirement to carry out the risk assessment. Any Department which knows it is to be decentralised  in toto and knows the locations to which it will be decentralised does not have to wait for Phil Flynn to report before it carries out what is an obligation under the accountability now required of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers, that is, to carry out this type of risk assessment. That is an aspect of this area to which I intend to return.Since the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is here and has taken to this plan for decentralisation with a degree of enthusiasm we rarely see in Ministers supporting a Government plan, I wish to say to him in the kindest possible way that I find it fascinating that a Progressive Democrats member of the Government should be able to "out" Fianna Fáil on what is essentially a Fianna Fáil project. If the former leader of his party, Des O'Malley, was here today and was sitting in Cabinet, would he allow, or agree to, the breaking up of the Civil Service in the way it is now being proposed, namely, the physical breaking up of it through the decentralisation proposals, the abolition of the Civil Service Commission, the compromising of the independence of the Civil Service and farming out to Fianna Fáil-connected accountants and recruitment agencies in different parts of the country the business of recruiting civil servants to what was once a proud and independent institution? That is a question the Minister of State can answer for himself.My constituency of Dún Laoghaire was one of those which responded to the call of the Tánaiste to give the Progressive Democrats eight seats in the Dáil and to the call of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, when he climbed up the lamp post, to elect the Progressive Democrats to act as a watchdog on Fianna Fáil. I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and, indeed, my constituency colleague, that there are many people in my constituency who cast their first preference votes for the Progressive Democrats at the last election in the expectation that they were electing eight Des O'Malleys or eight Bobby Molloys. They did not bargain on them caving in and presiding, in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon——

Listening to the comments of Deputy Gilmore concerning decentralisation one would think he was talking about the whole world, but Ireland is not that big a country. A perception has been a long time in vogue, and rightly so, that the view of senior public servants in major Departments was a view from Dublin. It is time we got a view from the country as well. I welcome wholeheartedly the provisions for decentralisation as outlined by the Minister for Finance in the budget. Time will tell that this is one of the great innovative moves of our era. I will return to the decentralisation issue later in my contribution.The Bill before us will complement the recently announced decentralisation programme by ensuring that the necessary human resources policies will be in place to support and assist in the changes that are coming in the public service. The Bill's provisions and the overhaul of recruitment practices will be a great support in a highly regionalised public service when the majority of civil servants are located outside Dublin.It is a significant reform of the Civil Service recruitment procedures and, like much legislation that has been published in recent years, its origins lie in the social partnership process. In particular, it meets one of the key undertakings for modernisation in Sustaining Progress. It is introducing genuine flexibility into the recruitment process, which will support the Government's decision on decentralisation announced in the budget.The Bill changes the recruitment and appointment processes of the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána and posts under the remit of the Local Appointments Commission, which include senior and professional posts in local government, health boards and VECs. The Bill allows for orders to extend regulation to other public service bodies.The provisions of the Bill introduce an important new element of flexibility into the recruitment system. As a result of the changes being introduced, public sector organisations will be able to recruit staff when and where they need them. It is common sense that if Departments and other public service bodies want to ensure a consistent supply of suitable recruits, they should be able to apply for licences to recruit directly. This is an important issue across the public service because senior civil servants need to be able to recruit staff to work in various sectors. When the Civil Service seeks to recruit specialised people to work in particular areas, it goes outside the public service and may use consultants in some cases. I hope the Bill will eliminate the need for a certain number of the consultants who have been brought into various Departments. Heads of Departments should be able to head-hunt individuals for the advice that is sought.Reform of the recruitment process has been intended for some time and it has been clear that recruitment systems had to change to meet current circumstances. However, it is crucial that change should not lead to a diminution of the public's trust in the fairness of the system. The independence of the public service has been one of the greatest achievements since the foundation of the State. That independence has continued to the present day and I congratulate all those who work in the public service for ensuring that it operates in a fair and trustworthy manner.The degree of decentralisation decided by the Government naturally means that human resource policies relating to Civil Service recruitment, promotion and transfers will have to be countrywide. The Bill will enable a more locally focused approach to recruitment and promotion, which will be essential in making certain that decentralisation happens smoothly and efficiently.The Bill is part of a strategic approach to the management of human resources within the Civil Service and those other public service bodies to which it applies. The Bill is not a stand-alone measure, it is a vital component of the programme of modernisation which was concluded with the public service unions in Sustaining Progress.As is only to be expected from a Government that sets such store by the partnership principle, the public service unions have been fully consulted about these measures and they agreed to the introduction of the Bill in Sustaining Progress. Furthermore, to return to a debate that took up much time in the latter part of 2003, the reforms being implemented are a further sign that the much maligned benchmarking agreement in Sustaining Progress has produced real and effective change in the way the public service operates. That is something we must bear in mind when considering the Bill.Until now, Departments were obliged to use the Civil Service Commission to recruit staff on their behalf. With this legislation, licence holders will also be allowed to engage the assistance of private sector recruitment agencies which have been approved by the commission in recruiting staff. This step is to be welcomed.The Bill will provide Secretaries General with the capacity to manage their Departments and offices in a more effective manner. In recent years, it has become apparent that the public appointments system is too rigid to accommodate modern labour market conditions. At times, the centralised recruitment system has brought too slow a response to recruitment requirements.The Bill dissolves the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission and creates the Commission for Public Service Appointments and the Public Appointments Service. The Public Appointments Service will carry out recruitment functions for Departments and other public service bodies within the remit of the legislation, which choose not to recruit directly.The Commission for Public Service Appointments will set standards for recruitment to the Civil Service and the public service. These standards will serve to maintain the probity of the recruitment process. The commission will also scrutinise the level of compliance with these standards and in the event that possible compromises of the recruitment process are discovered, it will be empowered to issue instructions to licence holders. It is vitally important that if, after the Bill has been enacted, shortcomings are discovered in the recruitment process, corrective measures can be taken by issuing instructions to licence holders concerning recruitment.The parts of the Bill dealing with standards will be of great importance in progressing the legislation. Since the foundation of the State, the independence and integrity of the Civil Service have proved to be vital assets. The Government is to be congratulated on its determination to maintain the fairness and probity of the recruitment system. The public has great confidence in the way the recruitment process is currently handled and that system cannot and will not be lost.The modernisation programme in the current partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, combined with decentralisation, will ensure that the Civil Service and the public service are well placed to meet the many new demands which will be placed on them.Public expectation of better and more efficient public services for people and communities is entirely justified. The Bill must be viewed in the context of that expectation. The Bill aims to modernise a key aspect of our public service system and it signals the Government's determination to secure real change in line with the approach in Sustaining Progress.Various commentators view decentralisation as a backward step and they have been giving out about it. The Opposition parties are probably disappointed they are not implementing the programme and that is painful for them. As soon as the programme was announced, it was suggested the various heads of Departments would not be able to meet because they would have to travel from all over the country. However, it is about time heads of Departments worked in rural Ireland. "Prime Time" recently reported on who dictates the standards to be applied in rural Ireland but the mindset in rural Ireland is that the country is run from Dublin and it is time for other cities and towns to become part of the decision-making process.I recently heard a Member say he was in favour of decentralisation as long as it took place around the M50. Those of us who travel long distances to Dublin every week know there is life outside Dublin and a different perspective must be taken. Many departmental offices are located in rented buildings throughout Dublin at a significant cost to the Exchequer but buildings could be constructed in the towns to which offices will be decentralised at a fraction of the rent paid in Dublin. I welcome the vigour with which the Government has attacked the decentralisation programme.Many decisions have been taken by successive Governments over the years but the necessary impetus to implement them was not forthcoming from everybody concerned. However, this cannot be said of decentralisation. The programme was announced in the budget and expressions of interest from individuals in the designated towns were sought on 16 January, which included information on sites and so forth. OPW officials have visited every location, examined the sites and met the local authority planning officials to seek advice. It is an inclusive process, as local bodies are being engaged to advise the OPW on what should be done in these towns. I welcome the Government's initiative on this issue and I hope it will keep it up to secure decentralisation for these towns. It has been welcomed throughout rural Ireland.The recommendations of the cross-party departmental group are being implemented in the legislation. Its members recognised there was a need to update Civil Service recruitment procedures and I hope, when the Bill is enacted and decentralisation has taken place, senior civil servants will source their staff from both the public and private sectors locally. The Bill should go a little way to reduce the amount expended by the State on consultants and so-called experts in regard to every facet of the public service. I hope the Bill will allow State agencies to head-hunt people for specific jobs within the public service.I congratulate public servants and politicians who, through the years, have ensured Ireland has built one of the most reputable and independent Civil Service bodies. All civil and public servants should be congratulated on their work. I commend the Bill to the House.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Civil Service has provided excellent service since the foundation of the State and it has retained absolute credibility in its work. Difficulties always arise but civil and public servants have given excellent service through the years. Questions regarding inefficiencies and so on should be looked on positively rather than negatively because, if one does not challenge and examine what is going on, one is not of assistance to anyone. People must reflect on where they are and how services can be improved.The legislation was introduced to support the Government's decision to decentralise and concerns have been expressed that the recruitment system is also being decentralised. There is a great deal of confidence in the Civil Service Commission and its recruitment procedures and the Government should ensure confidence is maintained in the new body because, regardless of the concerns and votes of Opposition Members, the Government has the numbers to pass the legislation. The worry about the maintenance of the current system's credibility is important.Members have used the words "jobbery" and "having influence" in regard to the appointment of civil servants in local communities following decentralisation. The system must be transparent, open to examination and free from doubt, similar to the current system. If decentralisation ever takes place, such credibility must be maintained and no questions must be asked of the system.One third of civil servants will be decentralised to 54 locations and the announcement in this regard took no more than three or four minutes during the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement. There is a great deal of concern regarding how the announcement came about and the lack of transparency and openness in reaching the decision to decentralise. A private company, for example, would undertake a strategic management examination of all aspects of its operations and likely outcomes of a decision to decentralise.A policy statement outlining the reasons for decentralisation, how the locations were identified and the positive aspects of these locations should have been published. We do not know what the thinking was behind the decision and how the policy was developed by the expert group. Did the Minister of State examine the downsides of decentralisation? Were potential difficulties identified, such as a reduction in services? What plans have been made to minimise such difficulties? It is important that we have an open debate on the difficulties that will arise with regard to decentralisation and how the Government proposes to minimise these difficulties.Decentralisation will present opportunities. We would like to be informed of the opportunities for improved service in each of the 54 locations and how those opportunities will be maximised while the difficulties are being minimised. We do not know what those opportunities are or how the Government proposes to maximise them. There has been a lack of discussion and information. If the Government were legislating for this measure the House would have an opportunity to tease out the issue on Committee Stage of the Bill, to ask the relevant questions and to put the Minister on the spot and make him give detailed answers to those questions.The decentralisation proposals must be seriously scrutinised. To ask the House to accept, as an act of faith, the Minister's assurance that everything will be all right on the day is not good enough. As a Legislature and a House of Parliament, the Dáil should be in a position to debate fully this serious and complex proposal with far-reaching implications for the delivery of service to the country, how it has been thought out and how the Government sees it going forward. It is unfair to ask the Oireachtas to make an act of faith in what is happening without flushing out all aspects of the proposal to decentralise and all its implications. For example, we do not know why the Minister for Finance decided that a quarter of the jobs should go to the hubs and three quarters to other locations. I am not saying the Minister does not have a good reason but I do not know what the reason is. It has been seriously suggested that this decision was taken for political reasons. Will the Minister of State tell us why only a quarter of the jobs went to the population hubs? That is a reasonable question. How will the system operate in practice? The media inform us that the Government is having difficulty in obtaining people to transfer to the new locations.

We do not know how many are involved. Is it 5%, as some people speculate, 10%, 20% or 30%? We do not know. Will the Minister of State indicate the level of up-take of the proposal? Is it sufficient to ensure that decentralisation will come about within the timeframe the Government has outlined?Concern has been expressed that experienced teams of service deliverers in different Departments will be broken up, with officials from the Departments of Education and Science, Agriculture and Food and the Prison Service, for example, coming together in Parlon country to set up a new office. The Government accepts that relocation will be on a voluntary basis. However, 100%, or even 50%, of any Department will not volunteer to go to Killarney, Cavan, Portlaoise or wherever. Interdepartmental people will come together to form new inexperienced teams. What effect will this have on the quality of service delivered over the learning curve period? How long will the learning curve period be for those new teams? There must be a learning period for people who will be operating in a new area. A decentralised office will be doing very well if 30% of its staff are experienced in the area of work, but that will mean that 70% of the staff will have to read into the new situation. What will the learning period be for those people? Will it be two months, five months, 12 months or two years? That issue must be addressed. Civil servants have expressed concern about decentralisation.

The three key Departments of Health, Education, and Justice combined to deliver services for children. Deputy Currie experienced much difficulty in trying to achieve understanding of the issues and co-operation between the three Departments. Even with senior officials present in Dublin and available for committee meetings, difficulties were experienced. How much more difficult will this be with people spread around the country? Lack of promotional opportunities and the inevitable restrictions of personal development which will result from geographical reasons will create greater difficulties for the cross-cutting policies giving service to the areas which need them. Many policy areas are not specific to one Department. Departments have traditionally operated within their own territories and have found it difficult to involve themselves in cross-cutting issues. With Departments located in different areas and with promotion and recruitment likely to come from those areas, how will the Minister ensure that efficiency is maintained and enhanced?

Sé an Rialtas sin a chuaigh ar lorg an islithe chéanna agus is ar an Rialtas seo atá dualgas anois athrú céime a éileamh agus a bhaint amach.I propose to approach this debate on the Irish language in a positive spirit, providing the Government with every opportunity to join with all on this side of the House in supporting the motion. In particular, I want to avoid some tendencies that have bedevilled too many political debates on the Irish language and language policy. One is a natural reaction to the perceived attitude of mind of a small minority of Gaeilgeoirí, a mixture of superiority tinged with some scorn for those who through no fault of their own do not, like them, have the language. There is a related factor that must also be avoided, a link that is sometimes, perhaps unfairly, made between sections of the Gaeilgeoir community and xenophobia, indeed to the physical force tradition, which most Irish people, including Gaeilgeoirí, now abhor as redundant.Another factor is a legacy of British rule, deeply ingrained in our psyche, not least among some cainteoirí dúchais but not confined to native speakers and also to be found in other corners of the former empire, what in Australia and New Zealand is called “cultural cringe”. This is the belief that one’s own culture is backward and unsophisticated compared to other cultures, most particularly British culture, and it is an undoubted historical feature of Irish, Australian and New Zealand life. In our own country it takes the form of the west Brit outlook, and the attitude encapsulated in the Dublin Opinion cartoon, “Bhí gaeilge agam, now I have a big job.”There is also a fourth factor that bedevils debate, the off-putting effect of the lip service paid by officialdom to the linguistic cause, in particular in the spheres of administrative action and politics, particularly as played by Fianna Fáil for all it is worth. As I shall shortly point out, our Judiciary has been, and continues to be, considerably more protective and respectful than has been the Executive power, as well as scathing of the official attitude and being sensible and balanced in its judgments.We also need to avoid being hostage to certain "sacred cows", special pleading and the stale traditionalism of Myles's Bonaparte Ó Cúnasa's Corca Dorcha. We are dealing here with our history, including the role of the cultural revival in Irish national development. The revival was an essential element in an exercise of differentiating us from the English and binding us together as ‘Irish', creating a nation and a nationalism that would ultimately express itself in statehood. The cultural revival was very much a political project with a political ambition. While there were, of course, those who were principally cultural Nationalists, who largely eschewed the political side of things, in the round the cultural revival was a political force and very many of those who were politically active in the national cause were also engaged in or animated by, the cultural project, to whatever extent. The link between culture, nationality, statehood and language is there, evident in both the Constitutions that have ruled us since Independence, in Article 4 of the Saorstát Éireann Constitution and Article 8 of Bunreacht na hÉireann.Today people generally, not just in Ireland, are sensitive about their identity. This is reflected in concerns about multiculturalism, perceived loss of sovereignty, globalisation, Americanisation and the like — they want a badge that identifies them as in whatever way ‘unique'. I have no problem with any of this in moderation. I am sympathetic towards it as long as it does not spill over into xenophobia, notions of superiority and so forth.Detailed arguments have been advanced in support of the Government's request to have accorded to the Irish language the status of an official language of the European Union. The campaign group Stádas has set out some of these arguments. Stádas makes the critically relevant point that there is really no great issue here. Irish speakers have a right to have grievances addressed to the European Ombudsman dealt with in Irish, to petition the European Parliament in Irish and to correspond with the various institutions of the Union — the Council, the Commission and so on — in Irish. The treaties are also available in Irish — Irish is a treaty language. Irish is also an official language of the European Court of Justice. The big issue really relates to Community legislation, the directives and regulations that form part of the  acquis communautaire, community law, and the publication of the Official Journal.The intention behind this motion is that in the change in status being made, the Union would be responsible for producing future texts of Community legislation in Irish, with Ireland having responsibility for the legacy issue, which it arguably should be doing anyway in light of the Ó Beolain case, to which I shall return.However useful on many aspects of detail its submission to the National Forum on Europe, from my own position of emphasising rights, history and culture, I find the Stádas presentation somewhat incomplete. In particular I am uncomfortable with the contention that this issue is in some measure about jobs for Gaeilgeoirí. This is not only about jobs, or even mainly about jobs, and if it were, it is a demand redolent of ‘Corca Dorcha' that I would find difficult to support.In essence, the argument about the status of the Irish language in Europe and, I would also particularly emphasise, at home is to my mind about our Constitution, the constitutional rights of citizens, but also our own historic and indeed modern-day sense of ourselves as a people, our sense of what we are. Both of these aspects, our sense of ourselves and our history, and the constitutional status accorded to Irish are intimately interconnected. We also need to develop a sensible approach to how we can create a real bilingual society in Ireland and how to accommodate the languages of our new citizens in this new Ireland. We need to address our poor record in language teaching — the contribution of native Government has been to create one of the worst societies in terms of familiarity with other European languages, and it is not improving. In the now famous 2001 case of Ó Beoláin v. Fahy, Mr Justice Hardiman approvingly quoted the words of then Chief Justice Kennedy, in the 1934 case of O’Foghludha v. McClean, relating to Article 4 of the Saorstát constitution:One of the distinguishing marks of a nation, in the sense of a distinct people (though not a necessary or universal mark) is the possession of a common national language. This nation of ours possessed that distinguishing characteristic in the Irish language. It was the common speech of every Irish man down to comparatively recent times, when it yielded before immense pressure, compulsion in the schools, social political and commercial forces.He went on to remark:The language position at the date of the enactment to the Constitution is so fresh in our memories as to need no statement but the importance of it here is for the interpretation of Article 4. The declaration by the Constitution that the National Language of the Saorstát is the Irish language does not mean that the Irish language is, or was at that historical moment, universally spoken by the people of the Saorstát, which would be untrue in fact, but it did mean that it is the historic distinctive speech of the Irish people, that it is to rank as such in the nation, and by implication that the State is bound to do everything within its sphere of action (as for instance in State-provided education) to establish and maintain it in its status as the national language and to recognise it for all official purposes as the national language.The critical judicial conclusion is:None of the organs of the State, legislative, executive, or judicial, may derogate from the pre-eminent status of the Irish language as the national language of the State without offending against the Constitutional provisions of Article 4 [of the Saorstát constitution].Mr. Justice Hardiman expressed the belief that "the implication into the text of the 1922 Constitution of a binding obligation on the State in relation to the language" was equally appropriate to the construction of Article 8 of our current Constitution. Importantly, he further concurred with the words of Mr Justice O'Hanlon in a 1988 judgment that: "— the provisions of Article 8 of Bunreacht na hÉireann are stronger still in terms of giving recognition to the Irish language than was Article 4 of the Free State Constitution".Unless and until, if ever, the people decide to change the provisions of Article 8, such as for example along lines recommended in 1996 by the constitutional review group, or the Oireachtas legislates in line with the provisions of Article 8.3 of the Constitution, the Irish language has the status of being the national language and the first official language and our Judiciary has in this context given us some understanding of what this means administratively and in our courts of justice.No doubt the courts have not had their final say on these matters, not least in the wake of Ó Beoláin and now also that we have adopted the Official Languages Act 2003 and, with that enactment, the establishment of the position of An Coimisinéir Teanga and the imposition of various statutory duties on public bodies in respect of the language. We are at least formally developing an ever more explicit bilingualism in respect of the domestic life of the State, although we have yet to see whether there is more to this than formal concession to what most Ministers probably regard cynically as the whimsical folly of the Minister for Rural Community and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and have not the remotest intention of funding. I suspect the Minister knows this to be the case.The current policy of the Government in respect of the status in Europe of the Irish language has, in the circumstances appropriately, been given to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív to enunciate. It is best captured by the following hollow, miserable formulation by the Minister when speaking last December:Bímid i gcónaí ag iarraidh deis chuí a fháil chun an teanga a chur chun cinn san Aontas Eorpach. Mar shampla, bainfidh an láithreán ghréasáin spesialta a bhéas ann don Uachtaránacht feidhm fhorleathan as an dteanga i rith na sé mhí seo chugainn.As befits the great party of tokenism and cultural cringe that is Fianna Fáil, this is a fine formulation indeed. It is seoinínism through and through.Mar a mhíníonn Stádas, níl an oiread sin i gceist sa chás seo muna bhfuil an meon seoiníneach san áireamh. Is go hiomlán faoin Rialtas é socrú a dhéanamh go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina teanga oifigiúil de chuid an Aontais. Mar atá raite, níl aon idirbheartaíocht i gceist, seachas faoin gclár ama b'fhéidir. Níl i gceist ach go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas in iúl don Choimisiún gurbh mhian le hÉirinn go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ina theanga oifigiúil agus go gcuirfeadh an Coimisiún na leasuithe cuíthe ar aghaidh go dtí Comhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh, agus ghlacfaí leis an athrú d'aon ghuth.Níl le rá agam anois ach, mar a ghuíonn an phríomhaoire go minic anseo, "Molaim an rún".

Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go bhfuil an Freasúra ina iomlán tagtha le chéile anocht ar chomhaidhm, go n-aithneofar an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas Eorpach. Tá sé soiléir le tamall fada gurbh é sin an tuairim ag Gaeilgeoirí, muintir na Gaeltachta agus gach duine aga bhfuil suim sa Ghaelainn aige ar fud na tíre. Nuair a bhí Coimisún na Gaeltachta curtha ar bun ag an Aire agus é ag thart ar an tír, ba léir gurbh é an fonn is mó ná go mbeadh an Ghaelainn aitheanta mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas Eorpach. Tá sin scriofa i dtuarisic an Choimisiúin agus soiléir do gach duine. Ní thuigtear cén fáth nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta an beart a dhéanamh ar son na Gaelainne agus ar son muintire na hÉireann.Níl aon dabht, ó bunaíodh an Stát, go bhfuil líon na nGaeilgeoirí méadaithe go mór. Ag amharc ar an daonáireamh, i 1926, bhí 540,000 Gaeilgeoirí agus i 1986 bhí níos mó na 1 mhilliún. Tá méadú an-mhór tagtha ar labhairt agus ar eolas na Gaelainne sa tír seo. Ní thuigim cén fáth ansin nach bhfuil an Rialtas agus an Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív, sásta an t-aitheantas seo a thabhairt don Ghaelainn. Tá a lán déanta ag an Aire Ó Cuív don Ghaeilge, níl aon amhras faoi sin, chuir sé Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla fríd an Dáil agus tá níos mó Gaelainn á labhairt anois sa tír, go speisialta sa Státseirbhís. Cén fáth, anois, nach bhfuil sé sásta troid go láidir ar son na Gaeilge? Ní thuigim seo. Más rud é nach bhfuil sé sásta, ba chóir go n-éireoidh sé as oifig mar tá seo chomh bunúsach sin do chainteoirí Gaeilge.Ní bheidh ach tír amháin san Aontas Eorpach méadaithe nach mbeidh a teanga aitheanta mar theanga oifigiúil. Cén fáth nach bhfuil an beart déanta ag an Aire? Tá lucht na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, go léir ag troid ar son na haidhme seo. Tá gach duine i bhfabhar an rúin seo so cad chuige nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta é a dhéanamh? Caithfidh an tAire a rá linn agus mioneolas a thabhairt ar a chuid argóintí. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sásta gan an obair a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge.Ó bunaíodh an Stát, chuir roinnt daoine an-fhuinneamh sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht. Ní raibh baint ag Conradh na Gaeilge leis an bpolaitíocht ach bhí sé go mór ag dul ó áit go háit ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chothú agus an cultúr Gaelach a choimeád go deo. Tá an-job déanta ag Conradh na Gaeilge san fheachtas seo. Tá moladh toilte aige. Nuair a bhí m'athair ina mhúinteoir óg sna 1920í agus na 1930í, bhí post aige mar thimire Ghaeilge. Bhí sé ag múineadh na Gaeilge i rith an lae agus san oíche rachadh sé thart ar a rothar i dTiobraid Arainn. Bhí a lán timirí eile ag an am sin ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chothú. Tá lá nua ann anois agus suim sa Ghaelainn ann. Bhí mé ag féachaint ar TG4 le déanaí agus chonaic mé mic léinn na n-ollscoileanna anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath ag rá go gcaithfear an Ghaeilge a aithint mar theanga oifigiúil. Tá an spreagadh in achan áit sa tír agus tá suim sa cheist seo.All over the country, Irish language speakers, members of Conradh na Gaeilge and, in particular, young people are interested and actively involved in this campaign. They want to see Irish recognised as an official working language of the European Union. Never was there a greater opportunity or a chance so readily within our grasp. When the languages of countries being brought into the European Union are recognised, why is Irish not recognised? There is no excuse.The number of Irish speakers has increased massively since 1926 when the census I quoted was published. There are 150 Gaelscoileanna all over the country and a very active, vibrant and committed group who speak the language. An increasing number of people wish to use Irish and to see it recognised. They see no reason it should not be so. I urge the Minister to fight in Cabinet using the arguments of the Irish language movement and those who are behind this issue. They all want it to happen now. As I said in Irish, no one doubts the commitment of the Minister to the Irish language.There are many in the Gaeltachtaí who say the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is the man to do this job, but he is doing nothing. The Minister must do this job. There is no doubt he has delivered on the Official Languages Act and his personal commitment is well known and widely acknowledged, but on this issue of principle, the Minister will fail utterly if he fails to secure the recognition of Irish. He is sitting at Cabinet table and it is his responsibility. He has all the interest groups behind him and he has no excuse. This is a real battle to give our language, nation and culture proper, true and final recognition among the body of European countries whose languages are being recognised and translated. Their representatives can rise in the EU Parliament and speak in their languages but Irish people cannot.When Fine Gael Member of the European Parliament, Mary Banotti, rose to speak in Irish, she was told she could not as she had failed to provide due notice. No due notice is required if the language is official. While there are some who would prefer if the native speaking MEP from Connemara did not speak at the EU Parliament, I welcome his membership, even as an independent. I have no doubt that he would love to speak Irish. I ask the Minister to support him in that, not just at the convention.

They want to know where their jobs are and where their children will work. While there is a greater level of Irish use in the Civil Service and in the community since the passage of the Official Languages Act, why should they not aspire to work in the European Union also? Why should they not be able to use Irish as a qualifying language for EU positions when every other country's citizens can? The Minister is frozen in time on this issue. The Government is inactive. People are extremely angry that the Government is failing to carry out the wishes of supporters of the Irish language.To turn to mass media and communications, TG4 is a wonderful language station of which we can all be proud. It does a tremendous job and there is great support for it and goodwill towards it. As Deputy Rabbitte said, a tide is flowing in terms of Irish people who are interested in and committed to their culture. We are all flowing in the same direction and we all want this. While the Minister may be able to name one in his speech, I can think of no political reason it should not happen.Tá gach duine i bhfabhar an scéil seo, níl aon duine ina choinne. Caithfear lucht Fianna Fáil an gníomh a dhéanamh ar son muintire an Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.There are problems in terms of Irish language use in the Gaeltacht among certain age cohorts as the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta demonstrates. It is a serious issue that very young people in the Gaeltacht tend not to use Irish. The report voices real concern that Irish will be lost over three or four generations in what are fine active Gaeltachtaí now. We must balance that, of course, with the increasing use of Irish outside the Gaeltachtaí. If being a gaeilgeoir and coming from a Gaeltacht is worth anything, native speakers must be able to say that theirs is not a second-class language. Let us hope that when this debate is over they can say theirs is a world-class language which is recognised in the European Union as one with official status.Níl aon dul as ag an Aire faoin scéal seo. Caithfear an bua a bheith againn sa rún seo agus san fheachtas seo. Beidh muintir na hÉireann má dhéanfaidh an Rialtas an job ar son na Gaelainne.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	467	Gabhaim buíochas le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre agus leis an Teachta Rabbitte as deis a thabhairt dom tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo atá an-tábhachtacht. I would like to be able to speak entirely in Irish, but if I did, interested persons without the ability to speak the language would be unable to read my remarks in the Official Report. It is only produced in the language spoken in the House, even though the cluasáin can be worn by anyone who is fortunate enough to be a Member, but not by those in the Public Gallery. We are very much in need of reforms in that regard in this House as well as in the European Union.The points I wish to make will serve to highlight the contrast between the position of the Government and positions of other member states and applicant countries on their official languages. This matter does not involve any great cost factor, which makes one wonder why the Government is not pushing ahead more strongly and effectively. I will refer to my experience of trying to conduct the business of parliamentary questions through Irish in this House as it must be highlighted. It is important to estimate the number of translators needed. It is one of the issues which is a practical, knock-on effect of the Government's decision to take this motion and act on it.During my contribution I will refer to the conditions which must be met by an official language. It does not have to be spoken by everybody in a national Parliament to become an official language. There are very basic requirements in place and Irish fulfils them all. There is also a need to outline the implications of a failure to secure official status for Irish. It is not a neutral debate. If we fail to secure official status, the Irish language will suffer damage. Unfortunately, in speaking on this issue, one must also refer to Fianna Fáil promises made in the programmes for Government of this and the last Administration and, subsequently, broken. It is important to point out that omissions in the context of the language and our admission as a member state in 1972 were honest mistakes born of a lack of understanding of what was involved. The only issue on the table is the timeframe for introducing it. The decision has to be taken now and the discussion can take place on the timeframe for its introduction using all the practical issues that need to be dealt with.Dé Domhnaigh seo caite shínigh mise ar son Chomhaontais Ghlais na hÉireann cart ag búnadh Páirtí Ghlas na hEorpa ar an mbord céanna agus ar síníodh conradh na Róimhe i 1957. B'ócáid stairiúil sin agus chuir sé i gcuimhne dom gur thug gach tír san Aontas Eorpach a teanga oifigiúil náisiúnta féin isteach léi mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas ach amháin an tír seo. Is aisteach an rud é. Ó 1 Bealtaine 2004, beidh deich mballstát nua agus naoi dteanga oifigiúil nua, an Chipir mar éiscíocht mar tá an Ghréigis ann cheana.Níl fianaise ar bith cloiste agam go ndéarna tír ar bith eile gearán faoi chostas bhreise mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas. Is léir go bhfuil an-áthas ar na tíortha nua ag teacht isteach mar, nuair a bheidh teanga oifigiúil acu san Aontas Eorpach, beidh impleachtaí fostaíochta ann, is féidir leo dlíthe an Aontais a fháil ina dteanga féin agus beidh siad saor úsáid a bhaint as a dteanga féin i bParlaimint na hEorpa — beidh éad ar Sheán Ó Neachtáin faoi sin.Mar a dúirt an Teachta Rabbitte níos luaithe, níl aon deacracht leis na conarthaí, úsáidtear an Ghaeilge cheana. Má scríobhann duine as Gaeilge chuig oifig san Aontas, gheobhaidh sé freagra as Gaeilge. Tá mé cinnte, áfach, go mbeidh leisce ar go leor daoine sin a dhéanamh mar caithfear bheith ceanndána faoi úsáid na Gaeilge nuair nach bhfuil an traidisiún sin ann agus mura bhfuil tosaíocht tugtha ag an Rialtas ar an gceist, is cinnte go mbeidh deacracht in aigne daoine sin a dhéanamh. Má chreideann duine go bhfuil seirbhís trí Ghaeilge ar fáil, bainfidh sé úsáid aisti ach tá daoine in amhras faoi agus ní bhaineann. Nuair a rinne mé iarrachtaí ceisteanna parlaiminte a scríobh as Gaeilge, bhí glaonna gutháin ann agus cuireadh an cheist, "Any chance you can send me an English translation of that?" Ní ró-shásta a bhíonn daoine in oifig an phoist nuair a iarrtar foirm Ghaeilge orthu ach oiread.Níl le déanamh ag an Rialtas ach iarraidh ar Choimisiún an Aontais Eorpaigh rialachán 1 de chonradh na Róimhe a leasú. Sin bun is barr an scéil agus ba mhaith linn freagra ar cén fáth nach bhfuil sé á dhéanamh. Is féidir leis an Aire a rá gur rud an-chasta é nach dtuigimid cionn is go bhfuil muid go léir an-shimplí ach ag an am céanna níl iarratas déanta ag an Rialtas. Caithfidh Éire cinnte an acquis communautaire a aistriú ar ball agus tá go leor dlíthe as Gaeilge cheana féin mar is teanga conartha í.Ó thaobh aistritheoirí agus athteangairí, ag Malta beidh 110 aistritheoirí agus 40 athteangairí ag teastáil. Smaoinigh faoin spreagadh a bheidh ina leithéid do na Gaelscoileanna, d'Fhionntar i DCU, d'fhéinmheas, d'foghlamóirí agus do na cailíochtaí sa Ghaeilge a bheidh an-úsáideach. Beidh athrú bunúsach ar an dearcadh i leith na Gaeilge sa tír.Ní gá a rá ach oiread go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag gach iriseoir agus Teachta Dála. Bíonn na cluasáin sin caite ag iriseoir amháin, Cathal Mac Coille, duine a scríobhann as Gaeilge le  Foinse agus irisí eile, ach tuigim anois ó bheith sa Róimh agus sa Bhruisail, go bhfuil sé soiléir má éisteann duine as Béarla leis na cluasáin. Tá an fhuaim níos fearr agus b’fhéidir go bhfuil sé ag éisteacht leis an mBéarla chomh minic agus a bhíonn sé ag éisteacht leis an Ghaeilge. If Irish was an official language in the EU the culture of listening to the headphones might improve here. Chaith mise na cluasáin mar bhí an fhuaim níos soiléire.On the issue of the official status of Irish in the European Union, the Taoiseach tells the House regularly that in Malta the people speak Maltese in the markets and in the parliament, not forgetting it did all its negotiations in English just as Ireland did. It is important to bear in mind that it is not a requirement to speak Irish in one's Parliament, although many of us would prefer to use it more often, if the journalists would wear the headphones.Is gá an acquis communautaire a aistriú agus is féidir sin a dhéanamh. Is gá teanga náisiúnta a mholadh, agus is teanga náisiúnta sa Bhunreacht í an Ghaeilge so is féidir sin a dhéanamh. Is gá an t-iarratas a dhéanamh agus is féidir leis an Rialtas sin a dhéanamh más mian leis.Ní amháin go mbeidh an Ghaeilge thíos leis má théipeann ar an Rialtas stádas oifigiúil a lorg agus a bhaint amach ach beidh Éireannaigh faoi mhíbhuntáiste mar a bhí ó tháinig muid isteach san Aontas. Fiú ag obair trí Bhéarla, aon iarratas i gcomhair rúnaí nó cléirigh san Aontas, caithfidh iarrthóir bheith líofa i dteanga oifigiúil eile. Mura bhfuil Fraincis, Gearmáinism Spáinnis, Gréigis, Danmhairgis nó teanga eile aige chomh maith le Béarla agus Gaeilge, ní aithnítear ach go bhfuil teanga oifigiúil amháin aige — an Béarla. Tá Éireannaigh faoin mhíbhuntáiste an-bhunúsach ó thaobh fostaíochta de. Ní bhaineann seo le Gaeilge beag nó mór, baineann sé le cothrom na Féinne d'Éireannaigh mar shaorannaigh an Aontais Eorpaigh agus glacann an tAire leis sin. Tuigeann sé go bhfuil mé ag insint na fírinne. If one wants to be crude about it, the Government has failed to use Irish as capital in the European Union. It is a crude way of putting it but it is true.Ní amháin go mbeidh Éireannaigh faoi mhíbhuntáiste ach beidh an Ghaeilge fosta. Tá daoine frith-Ghaeilge amach ansin, de bharr bata a fuair siad ar scoil nó rud éigean, agus is fuath leo an teanga. Beidh go leor daoine sásta dul os comhair na cúirte agus a rá nach gceart dá leanaí Gaeilge a fhoghlaim mar níl aon mhaitheas ag baint leis toisc nach dteanga oifigiúil san Aontas Eorpach í agus nach bhfuil meas madra ag an Rialtas ar an Ghaeilge cionn is nár bhrú sé a cás agus, mar sin, ní ghá le leanaí á foghlaim. Tá súil agam nach dtarlóidh sin ach tá an baol ann go dtarlóidh.The other reality is that Irish does not have to be used in the same way as English. Danish is not used in terms of translations into everything. There are relay languages — English, French and, increasingly, German are used as a matter of course. Article 6 of the regulations provide that the institutions of the Community may stipulate in their rules of procedure which of the languages are to be used in specific cases. Go praicticiúil, beidh relay languages in uachtar agus ní bheidh brú an-mhór ar an Rialtas mar gheall ar Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oifigiúil.It is regrettable that it falls again to Fianna Fáil to try to fulfil a promise because we know all too often that is a forlorn hope. A promise in 1972 that Irish would be recognised as an official language of the enlarged Community was signed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Unfortunately, when we look closely at the fine print, we see that it is not listed among the official languages. We are told it is a working language. However, working languages are not mentioned in the lists.We are operating in a kind of fantasy land in regard to where the Irish language stands. The people in 1972 did not understand just how easy it would be to have Irish as an official language. I note that in 1997, the Government promised that there would be support for the official status of Irish and, in 2002, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government again promised it would implement the Gaeltacht Commission, Tuairisc Choimisiún an Gaeltachta. Its third recommendation is that Irish would have official status in the European Union.We have had enough tokenism in regard to Irish being used on websites and in other fancy places, as if that will give some comfort to those concerned about this. It is not an official language and the Minister has a responsibility to make that happen. I ask him to do so.

Dearbhaím don Teach uile go bhfuil an Rialtas aontaithe go hiomlán ar an gcur chuge atá ann i dtaobh na ceiste. Cuireann an díospóireacht seo Cath Eachdhroma i gcuimhne dom beagáinín. Mar is eol do staraithe, ba é Cath Eachdhroma an tubaiste mhór a tharla do na Gaeil. Smaoinítear freisin ar céard go díreach a tharla, nó céard a dúradh linn faoinar tharla. Dúradh linn ariamh go raibh an iomarca deifre ar St. Ruth, agus dá mbeadh beagáinín foighide agus cur chuige agus stáidéir ag baint leis, nach dtarlódh an tubaiste a tharla do na Gaeil an lá sin. Dá bhfagfadh an Sáirséalach ar an mbarr san áit cheart, ní dhéanfadh seisean an dearmad a rinne St. Ruth.Fáiltím go mór roimh an díospóireacht seo, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil éinne sa Teach seo — b'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine áirithe ann, ach níl aon pháirtí, mo pháirtí féin agus an Rialtas ina measc — nach mian leis nó léi an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tá a fhios agam freisin go bhfuil spéis ar leith ag daoine i gceist cur chun cinn na Gaeilge taobh istigh den Aontas Eorpach, go mórmhór ag an am seo nuair atá tíortha nua ag teacht isteach san Aontas. Is dóigh liom gur bhain daoine míchiall as na deacrachtaí praiticiúla a thug an Rialtas chun solais maidir le dul chun cinn, agus ghlac daoine leis nach raibh an toil nó an spéis ag an Rialtas an dul chun cinn sin a dhéanamh. Is é a mhalairt atá fíor.Sula ndéanfaimid cinneadh cén bealach is fearr dul chun cinn, is fearr teacht ar na fíricí iomlána, fiú dá mba rud é go mb'fhearr linn nach mbeadh na fíricí ar fad mar atá siad. Mar a thuigeann chuile dhuine sa Teach seo, go mórmhór muidinne sa traidisiún poblachtánach, ní furas an rud é an bearna idir an mian agus an gníomh a líonadh. Tá sé sin fíor i gcomhthéacs na Gaeilge, agus tá sé fíor freisin i gcás athaontú na tíre mar phoblacht neamhspleách. Caithfear é a thógáil céim ar chéim. Is ceacht é sin, mar shampla, a d'fhoghlaim Sinn Féin ar an mbealach crua.Ar ndóigh, is féidir liom rá go bhfuil an Rialtas seo tar éis díriú isteach go láidir ar an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ó toghadh mar Rialtas é sa mbliain 1997. Tá Aire sinsireach, uair amháin eile, freagrach as an Ghaeilge ó lá go lá. hAchtaíodh an tAcht teanga anseo anuraidh, agus rinne dlí de an mhí seo caite. Ar ndóigh, bhí lá stairiúil i saol na Gaeilge nuair a cheap Uachtarán na hÉireann an chéad Choimisinéir Teanga. B'shin an chéad reachtaíocht a thug creatlach reachtúil le haghaidh seachadadh seirbhísí trí mheán na Gaeilge. Is é príomhchuspóir an Achta ná déanamh cinnte go bhfuil seirbhísí poiblí ar fáil níos forleithne i nGaeilge agus go mbeidh caighdeán na seirbhísí sin i bhfad níos airde. Tá an Rialtas dírithe go hiomlán ar an Acht a chur i bhfeidhm, agus glacfaidh sé sin cuid mhaith díograise agus diongbháilteachta.Ar ndóigh, ó mhí Iúil seo caite, tá go leor oibre á cur isteach leis an aidhm seo a chur i gcrích. Cruthóidh an reachtaíocht seo dornán mór de chomhlachtaí poiblí, agus beidh orthu cur lena gcumas seirbhísí a chur ar fáil dá gcustaiméirí agus foilseacháin a chur ar fáil san dá theanga oifigiúil. Chomh maith leis sin, tá mionscrúdú radacach déanta ag an Rialtas le seacht mbliana anuas ar pholasaí na Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.Ar na rudaí atá déanta, tá bunú Fhoras na Gaeilge, bunú Choimisiún na Gaeltachta agus cur i gcrích na tuarascála, méadú ar chaiteachas ar infreastruchtúr na Gaeltachta, bunú Iomairt Cholm Cille, agus athbheochan, athláidriú nó atheagrú Choimisiún na Logainmneacha. Táimid tar éis an suirbhé is cuimsithí ariamh ar theangeolaíocht na Gaeltachta a choimisiúnú. Tá feachtas feasachta, mar a thugaimid air, maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge do thuisimitheoirí chun iad a spreagadh Gaeilge a labhairt lena gclann. Táimid ag cur athruithe ar scéim labhairt na Gaeilge. Tá forbairt déanta ar scéim na gcúntóirí teanga. Táimid ag tabhairt faoi scéim cuairteoirí baile. Tá forbairt á déanamh ar scéim na gcampaí samhraidh. Tá scéim phleanáil teanga an phobail i gcomhar leis an údarás á réiteach. Tá méadú mór ar an oideachas tríú leibhéil trí mheán na Gaeilge á chur ar fáil. Táimid tar éis na cánacha iomlána a athrú do mhná tí na Gaeltachta, agus táimid na híocaíochtaí a dhéantar leo a mhéadú. Táimid tar éis an t-údarás a iompú i dtreo na Gaeilge. I mbliana, cuireadh airgead breise ar fáil le haghaidh naíonraí lán-Ghaeilge agus seirbhísí don óige trí mheán na Gaeilge. Chomh maith leis sin, leag muid síos anuraidh go gcaithfear 20% de chaipiteal an údaráis a chaitheadh ar thionscnaimh atá teanga-lárnaithe. Níl ann sin ach liosta de chuid de na rudaí atá déanta ag an Rialtas seo i dtaobh na Gaeilge.Ar ndóigh, mar a dúirt mé ar ball, tá ceist na Gaeilge san Eoraip mar ábhar plé poiblí le tamall anuas. Fuair chuile dhuine scéala ó dhaoine atá ag iarraidh an scéal seo a chur chun cinn. Tá siad ag iarraidh go dtapfaimis an deis é sin a dhéanamh ar lá Bealtaine seo chugainn, an lá a méadfar an tAontas. Táimid ag éisteacht go cúramach leis an gcás sin. Tá grúpa oibre idir-ranna bunaithe, agus táimid ag déanamh anailíse ar na roghanna uilig atá ann. Táimid ag déanamh iniúchta ar na roghanna difriúla atá ann agus an bealach is praiticiúla agus is fearr an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Ina theannta leis sin, tá socrú déanta agam go mbuailfidh oifigigh ó mo Roinn le hoifigigh ó Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge — an gréasán comhordaithe atá ag na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge — ar bhonn rialta leis an cheist seo a phlé.

Ar cheann de na ceisteanna a gcaithfear machnamh a dhéanamh orthu, tá an bun-bhrí agus an bun-raon a bhaineann le teanga oifigiúil agus oibre an Aontais a d'éirigh trí ghníomhartha thar na blianta agus a cheadaíonn éagsúlacht sa bhrí agus sa ghníomh sin, mar shampla, an difríocht idir an Béarla agus an Mháltais san Aontas mar a bheas. Tuigtear i gcoitinne go gceadaítear dhá stádas — teanga oifigiúil agus oibre — aistriúcháin ar cháipéisí oifigiúla agus soláthair seirbhísí cuimsitheacha teangaireachta do chruinnithe. Chomh maith leis sin, aithnítear na teangacha oifigiúla agus oibre mar chailíocht do phost san Aontas Eorpach. Ní mór a luaigh gur thapaigh Rialtas i ndiaidh Rialtais le deis le cur le seasamh na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Maidir le seo, tá dul chun cinn maith déanta le tamall anuas. Dheimhnigh conradh Amsterdam i 1996 cearta shaoránaigh an Aontais chomhfhreagras a dhéanamh le haon instititiúid in aon cheann de na teangacha conartha. Éilíonn dearbhú a glacadh leis i gcomhar le conrad Nice 2001 go dtabharfar freagra ar chomhfhreagras mar é laistigh de thréimhse ama reasúnta. Is í an Ghaeilge an t-aon teanga nach dteanga oibre í lenar bhain se sin

Tá seo tábhachtach mar mura mbeadh an stádas seo ann — níl sé ann don Lucsambuirgis — thógfadh sé athrú conartha chun é a chur ann. Beidh mé ag caint faoin ndifríocht idir sin agus athrú rialacháin gur féidir a dhéanamh ag am ar bith ar ball.Ina theannta sin, ar iarratas uainne, ullmhaíodh leagan Gaeilge chomh maith den dreacht -chonradh bunreachtúil a aontaoídh air ag Coinbhinsiún na hEorpa. Aithníonn LINGUA, clár an Aontaisa do chur chun cinn i dteagasc agus foghalim teangacha, an Ghaeilge ina tionscadail.Anuraidh rinne an Rialtas beart le cur le seasamh an Gaeilge i gcomthéacs an athchóirithe i rialacháin foirne d'oifigigh an AE. Faoi rialacháin foirine athbhreithnithe a n-aontófar orthu go luath, agus mar thoradh ar thionscnamh de chuid na hÉirieann, éilíonn coinníoll nua d'oifigigh go gcaithfidh siad a léiriú roimh an gcéad ardú go bhfuil sé ar a gcumas obair a dhéanamh trí mhean na tríú teanga lena n-airítear ní hamháin teangacha oifgiúla agus oibre ach an Ghaeilge chomh maith. Maidir leis seo, is í an Gheilge an t-aon teanga nach teanga oifigiúil nó oibre í a chuirfear san áireamh. Ciallaíonn sin go bhfuil, de réir a chéile, úsáid bainte as an seasamh bunreachtúil atá ag an nGaeilge san Aontas Eorpach, rud go bhfuil daoine ag déanamh beag is fiú dó, le dul chun cinn céimiúil a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge sa gComhaontas Eorpach.Socraíodh stádas na Gaeilge sa mbliain 1971. Ag an am sin, aontaíodh gur teanga conartha a bheadh sa nGaeilge. Is ceist do staraithe an pháirt a bhí ag Rialtais, an stádas a bhí ag na teangacha éagsúla san Eorap ag an am, an úsáid laethiúil a bhí ag baint astu agus an t-athrú mór a bhí idir an stádas ag teanga oibre an t-am sin agus an cineál stádais atá an Liotúainis agus an Mháltais anois san Aontas Eorpach, a chíoradh. Bhí mise mar bhall de Chonradh na Gaeilge ag an am agus mé thar a bheith gníomhach agus ní chuimhin liom sinn ag déanamh mórán cur i dtaca faoi mar is mó a bhí muid dírithe ar chur in aghaidh an Aontais Eorpaigh go hiomlán ná mar bhí muid dírithe ar cheist na Gaeilge san Aontas.Ní hiad lucht na Dála nó lucht Rialtas ach chuile duine a bhí bainteach leis an scéal a rinne an fhaillí, más faillí a bhí ann, ach má dhéantar scrúdú siar ag an am sin, ní raibh na cuinsí maidir le cúrsaí teangacha san Aontas Eorpach ar bhealach ar bith mar an gcéanna leis an gcaoi atá siad i láthair na huaire.Is ag éirí as seo go bhfuil an stádas éagsúil seo ag an nGaeilge san Eorap. Níl sé ar cheann den 11 teanga atá ann agus tá stádas conartha aici. Is fiú smaoineamh go bhfuil teanga náisiúnta oifigiúil eile, an Lucsambuirgis, nach bhfuil ina teanga conartha.

Is faoi Rialachán na Comhairle 1/1958 a áirítear teangacha mar theangacha oifigiúla agus oibre. Caithfidh athrú ar bith i stádas oifigiúil na Gaeilge nó in aon teanga eile, seachas na forálacha a dhéanfaí mar thoradh ar idirbheartaíocht méadaithe, a dhéanamh trí Rialachán na Comhairle 1/1958 a athrú de réir na gnáthchleachtas atá i gconradh Chomhphobal na hEorpa.Tá an conradh aontachais daingnithe ag Éirinn trí na ionstraimí daingnithe a bhí leagtha iseach ar 18 Nollaig 2003. Faoi seo tá ionstraimí daingnithe leagtha isteach ag 13 as 15 bhallstáit. Ní féidir le héinne na hionstaimí seo a tharraingt siar nó a phlé athuair. Sin rud fána bhfuil míthuiscint. Nuair a glacadh leis an ionstraim ag glacadh leis na tíortha nua, glacadh go uathoibreach le leasú ar Rialachán na Comhairle 1/1958. Mar sin, ní bheidh aon rud sonrach le déanamh ar 1 Bealtaine. Ní raibh ann ach nuair a síníodh na conarthaí ag tógáil na dtíortha sin isteach san Eorap, go dtagann sé i bhfeidhm ar 1 Bealtaine ach ní bheidh leasú sonrach a dhéanamh ar Rialachán na Comhairle 1/1958 an lá sin. Dá mba rud é gur theastódh ó Éirinn go n-aithneofaí an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil oibre, chaithfimis dhul asainn féin agus an cás sin a chur chun cinn.Tá go leor cainte déanta faoin aitheantas atá ag an Mháltais mar theanga oifigiúil oibre. Díríodh go sonrach ar an daonra beag i Málta agus go labhartar an Béarla go forleathan ann. I mBealtaine 2002, i rith idirbheartaíochta aontachais, mhol Coimisiún na hEorpa go n-aithneofaí an Mháltais mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre a úsáideann institiúidí na hEorpa agus, fearacht na Gaeilge, gur teanga údarach de chuid na gconarthaí í. Agus na moltaí seo á dhéanamh ag an gCoimisiún, is cosúil gur bhunaigh sé caighdeán áirithe a úsáideadh mar slat tomhais agus úsáid na Máltaise á mheas aige. Léiríonn athbhreithniú ar na caighdeáin sin gur rinneadh an cinneadh sin ar go n-úsáideann na hinstitiúidí ar fad i Málta an Mháltais.

Má tá an ceart ag an Teachta nár úsáid sé é, agus tá muid ag teacht go croí na ceiste go hiomlán anois, agus nach bhfuil le déanamh ach é a iarraidh agus go dtabharfaí go huathoibreach, níl aon fhadhb ann. Más fíor gur bhain sé úsáid as an bpáipéar seo agus gur bunaíodh an cinneadh air, tá scéal eile againn.Caithfidh mé a rá go mb'fhearr liomsa bheith cinnte sula socróinn ar an chéad chéim eile seachas léimneach i dtosach agus aiféala a bheith orm ina dhiaidh. Sin é go díreach an rud atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas. Táimid ag déanamh an obair bhaile. Ón obair bhaile atá déanta go dtí seo, níl aon chúis againne creidiúint, faraor, nár tógadh an páipéar seo san áireamh agus an cinneadh seo á dhéanamh. Tráthúil go maith, cuireadh an cinneadh in iúl, mar shampla, ar 7 Bealtaine, tá dáta ar an bpáipéar seo go dtí 2 Bealtaine. Mar sin, is léir gur páipéar é a bhí á chur thart cúpla lá sula ndearnadh an cinneadh nó, b'fhéidir, fiú ar an lá a ndearnadh an cinneadh. Mar sin, caithfimid déanamh cinnte, chomh fada agus is féidir linn, sula dtógfaimid an chéad chéim eile, cén bealach is fearr. Más rud é go ndeirtear gur caitheadh é seo sa chiseán seo, mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, agus nár tógadh aon aird air sin agus nach bhfuil le déanamh ach iarraidh go mbeidh teanga ina teanga oifigiúil, éascaíonn sé an bealach go mór. Nuair a bheas a fhios sin againn go cinnte, sin an uair a dhéanfas muidinne ár gcinneadh. Ar ndóigh, más rud é go bhfaighimid amach gur tógadh é seo san áireamh, athraíonn sé sin an scéal, ach ní stopfaidh sé muid, mar dhaoine ciallmhara, féachaint cén bealach eile is féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh. Má éiríonn linn dul chun cinn, sin an bealach is fearr tabhairt faoi.Tá rud eile a gcaithfear a thógáil sa treis ag an am seo — rud atá, dár liomsa, go mór inár bhfabhar — ná go bhfuil athrú mór ag teacht ar réimeas teangacha taobh istigh den Aontas Eorpach. Bhí plé ar bun roimh Uachtaránacht na hIodáile maidir le húsáid na dteangacha san Aontas Eorpach, agus is dóigh liom go míníonn sé sin cuid den scéal a bhain le 1971 agus 1972. Tá socrú á dhéanamh anois ag éirí as méadú na hEorpa nach mbeidh ateangaireacht ar fáil le haghaidh go leor grúpaí oibre a bheas ag teacht le chéile san Eoraip. I go leor cásanna, ní bheidh ann ach Fraincis nó Béarla, Fraincis agus Béarla, nó Fraincis agus Béarla agus Gearmáinis. Cuirfear teorainn amach anseo le hateangaireacht iomlán — rud nach raibh fíor i 1973 — do líon teoranta na ngrúpaí oibre. Chomh maith leis sin, tá caint ar chóras íochtair mar a theastaíonn ateangaireacht ó dhuine le haghaidh cúrsaí oifigiúla agus le haghaidh teangacha oifigiúla agus oibre.Leis na hathruithe seo ar fad sa réimeas teanga, creidim go bhfuil oscailtí ann don Ghaeilge, agus tá deiseanna speisialta ag teacht ar an mbealach. Sin é an fáth go mba cheart dúinn leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá ar bun agus leis an stáidéar, agus bheith cinnte, nuair a dhéanfas muid an cinneadh cén bealach is fearr ar aghaidh, go bhfuil an t-eolas ar fad againn. Ar ndóigh, mar a dúirt mé cheana féin, tá an Rialtas seo dírithe go mór ar cheist na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Is cuimhin liom ráitéisí i bh Foinse a rinne an Teachta Ó hUiginn. B’fhéidir go mbréagnóidh sé anocht iad, ach dúradh go dúirt sé go raibh an Bille teanga chomh marbh le “dodo”.

Nuair a bhí muid ag plé an Achta teanga, bhí foighid ag baill an Tí seo nach raibh ag cuid mhór den phobal taobh amuigh ansin, mar níor thuig siad an córas. Thaispeáin baill an Tí seo an fhoighid a theastaíonn le rudaí a chur chun cinn. Is cuimhin leis na Teachtaí a bhí anseo an comhphlé stuama, ciallmhar a rinne muid maidir leis an mBille teanga. Is cuimhin liom an t-am seo anuraidh an chasaoid a bhí á déanamh maidir leis an easpa dul chun cinn, mar ab fhacthas do dhaoine ag an am, ach thuig mise, i gcúrsaí Rialtais agus go mórmhór i rudaí idirnáisiúnta, go mbogann rudaí go mall. Is fearr an rud a bhogaint ar aghaidh go mall agus an toradh ceart a aithint ná an rud a dhéanamh faoi dheifir le droch-thoradh air. Creidim go bhfuil an obair á déanamh go stuama agus go ciallmhar. Creidim go bhfeicfear toradh na hoibre sin. Tá mé muiníneach as an gcur chuige céanna atá á úsáid againn leis an gceist seo agus a d'úsáid muid i gcás an Achta teanga. Sa deireadh, feicfimid cén bealach is fearr an cheist seo a chur chun cinn. Níl éinne anseo — ach an oiread is gur beag an duine sa Teach seo — nár mhaith leis nó léi Éire aontaithe amáireach. Níl éinne ann a chuirfeadh ina aghaidh stádas oifigiúil oibre a bheith ag an nGaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Ní faoi sin atá an plé. Tá an plé ar fad bunaithe ar cén chaoi is fearr — cur chuige in aon léim amháin, má tá sé ar fáil, nó——

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Is mór an onóir dom labhairt ar an ócáid speisialta seo agus ar an rún speisialta seo. Rinne mé mo ardteistiméireacht as Gaeilge i 1963, ach nílim in ann labhairt go maith as Gaeilge mar táim as taithí.Following the accession of the new states next May, the European Union will have 20 official languages. Among these will be Latvian, Estonian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Slovene and Maltese, one of the two official languages of tiny Malta and spoken by fewer people than speak Irish. Our national language can and should be the 21st official language. The Irish language suffered grievously during foreign occupation, but so also did Latvian, Lithuanian and Maltese. These will now enjoy official status and the citizens of these countries will be proud as a result.The Irish language is one of the oldest written languages in western Europe and was the dominant language in Ireland up to the time of the Famine when more than two million Irish speakers, mostly poor tenant farmers and labourers, were lost through death and emigration. Worse still, the blow to national morale led to people losing confidence and respect for all aspects of our culture. That further hastened the decline of the national language.The national revival in the early part of the previous century, which led to a large measure of independence, stabilised the language situation and all Governments regarded it as a duty to promote language revival. This was to be expected as all prominent leaders of the Independence movement, such as Pádraig Pearse, Cathal Brugha, the two Corkmen, Terence MacSwiney and Michael Collins, recognised the importance of the Irish language. When Michael Collins was asked after signing the Treaty of Independence the most important task facing the new State, he replied: "The first and most important task is the restoration of the Irish language. Until that is done, we are not free". Perhaps the magnitude of the task was under-estimated and some of the official methods were not that wise. However, progress was made so that now almost everyone in the State understands and speaks some Irish.It is an interesting indication of progress that Raidio na Gaeltachta and TG4 have no problem finding and using the services of fluent Irish speakers in all professions, including religion, sports and political parties. We have even heard and seen Unionist spokespersons using the language. This is remarkable progress for a language that in living memory was only used by poor fishermen and farmers in the west.Another remarkable indication of progress is the rapid growth of gaelscoileanna, now to be found in every town and city suburb in Ireland. In my city alone, there are 15 gaelscoileanna while the second largest city in Ireland, Belfast, has 12. In advocating full official status for our national language, it is not just a question of giving a new sense of pride to Irish people at home and scattered throughout the world; there is also a practical reason. Whenever job opportunities with EU institutions arise, these are open to European Union citizens who can speak two or more official languages. Irish citizens applying for such jobs are disadvantaged as the Irish language is disregarded.It is a mystery why the Fianna Fáil Government did not win official status for Irish when we first entered Europe in 1973. The other countries would not have objected, but there is now a further opportunity that cannot and should not be missed. There is a duty on all parties and all people to ensure that the correct thing is done now. No cost is involved for Irish taxpayers. The European Union budget will cover the cost of translations of all Acts and regulations, as it will for all other languages.The Taoiseach took over the role of the European Presidency in January. Therefore, it is vital that he and the Government consider the future role of the Irish language in Europe. It is one of the richest and most beautiful languages in Europe and, most importantly, it is our language. It would be a shame and humiliation if he failed to obtain for Ireland the honour and status it richly deserves.

Tá lúcháir orm an deis a bheith agam, mar Theachta ón Ghaeltacht agus mar chainteoir dúchais, cúpla focal a rá faoin rún an-tábhachtach seo chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht. Is iomaí uair a chuir mé ceist seo orm féin, agus tá mé cinnte gur chuir go leor daoine eile an cheist chéanna: cad a tharla don Rialtas i 1972 nuair nár ghlac sé le stádas oibre nó oifigiúil don Ghaeilge sa Chómhargadh mar a bhí an uair sin? Deirim nár ghlac sé leis. Ní gá dom é a éileamh; bhí sé ansin ar phláta rompu, agus ní raibh againn ach le rá é a ghlacadh. Níor ghlac an Rialtas ag an uair sin é, agus níor chuala mé freagra na ceiste sin go fóill.Bhí sé an-suimiúil an rud a bhí le rá ag an Aire anseo anocht. Tá mé den bharúil gur thug sé iarracht, b'fhéidir, an locht a chur ar dhuine éigin eile seachas ar an Rialtas ag an am — Rialtas Fhianna Fáil. Dúirt sé go raibh sé i gConradh na Gaeilge ag an am. B'fhéidir go raibh locht de chineál éigin ar lucht Chonradh na Gaeilge go raibh rudaí eile ar a n-intinn agus nár bhrúigh siad agus nár chuir siad an cheist sin ar aghaidh. B'fhéidir, mar sin, go bhfuil an tAire den bharúil go bhfuil an locht ar Chonradh na Gaeilge agus ar eagraíochtaí na Gaeilge seachas ar na daoine a bhí ansin nuair a síníodh an conradh i 1972. Fágaimis é siúd mar atá sé. B'fhéidir go mbeidh seans ag an Aire freagra a thabhairt níos moille.Is minic a bhí mé féin ag smaointiú air seo, agus b'fhéidir go ndeachaigh aigne an phobail a bhí ann ag an uair i bhfeidhm ar an Rialtas. Beidh a fhios acu siúd a bhfuil cuimhne acu ar na 60í agus na 70í gur fíor a rá go raibh an Ghaeilge in ísle brí san am sin. Bhí go leor rudaí tar éis tarlú. Mar shampla, sna 60í, cuireadh deireadh leis na coláistí ullmhúcháin a bunaíodh sna 20í agus a chuir múinteoirí ar fáil a raibh Gaeilge den scoith acu do scoltacha agus bunscoltacha na tíre. Sna 70í chomh maith, bhí scoltacha beaga ar fud na Gaeltachta á ndúnadh. I dTír Chonaill, dúnadh Rann na Feirste. I gContae Chiarraí, dúnadh Scoil Dhún Chaoin a bhfuil aithne mhaith ag mo chomhghleacaí anseo uirthi. Tharla an rud céanna i gConamara. Sílim gur dúnadh cúpla scoil ansin, mar shampla, sa Bhaile Nua i gConamara. Ba é an polasaí a bhí ann ná scoltacha beaga Gaeltachta a dhúnadh, agus ar ndóighe, bhí sé sin ag déanamh dochair don Ghaeilge. Ag deireadh na 1960í agus ag tús na 1970í, ní raibh ach 13 scoil, only 13 primary schools outside the Gaeltacht were teaching through the medium of Irish, agus ní raibh ach cúig iarbhunscoil. I 1970 agus 1971, bhí an Rialtas ag rá leis féin go raibh deireadh leis an Ghaeilge, bhí rudaí go holc, agus sin leithscéal amháin b'fhéidir. Is cuimhin linn go léir go raibh feachtas ar fud na tíre ag an am sin, an Language Freedom Movement, in éadan na Gaeilge agus seans go ndeachaigh sin i gceann ar an Rialtas.Bhí feachtas eile ag an am céanna, Let the Language Live, agus bhí mé féin páirteach ann. Chuaigh mé ó dhoras go doras anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath ag iarraidh ar dhaoine síniú mar bhí muid ag iarraidh ligint don teanga bheith beo. Bhí Seán Ó Tuama, Gael Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge agus na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge ar fad ann. Bhí an-dhíospóireacht faoin teanga agus bhí sí faoi bhrú. Bhí Máirtín Ó Cadhain ina cheannródaí agus é ag rá gur chóir réabhlóíd a bheith sa tír fá choinne an teanga a choinneáil beo. Nuair a chuimnhímid ar na rudaí sin uilig, b'fhéidir gur iad na fáthanna a dúirt an Rialtas nárbh fhiú seo ó dheireadh ach is cinnte go ndéarnadh meancóg agus dochar mór don Ghaeilge san am sin.Tá muid anseo 30 bliain ina dhiaidh sin agus tá Uachtaránacht an Aontais Eorpaigh againn. Tá deis againn anois an rud nár déarnadh i 1972 a chur i gceart. Tá uair na cinniúna buailte linn agus ní thagann seo ach anois is arís. Tá deis againn nach mbeidh againn arís go ceann blianta fada — stádas oibre agus oifigiúil a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Cuireann sé iontas mór orm i mBunreacht na tíre seo go bhfuil dhá theanga oifigiúil againn, an Ghaeilge agus an Beárla ach, ag an am céanna, gurb í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil. Sin mar atá sé sa tír seo agus nuair atá muid san Eorap, níl stádas oifigiúil nó stádas oibre ag an Ghaeilge. Ní dhlíodóir mise agus níl a fhios agam an gcuireann sé sin leis an Bhunreacht go bhfuil an chéad theanga oifigiúil nach bhfuil stádas oifigiúil aici san Eorap. Sin ceist do dhlíodóir nó d'abhchóide scrúdú a dhéanamh uirthi.Tá athrú mór taghta ar dhearcadh muintir na tíre ó thaobh na Gaeilge ó shin. Bhí mé ag caint ar na 1960í agus 1970í ach tá athrú mór ag teacht ar rudaí, an Gaelscolaíocht mar shampla. Ar fud na tíre, tá 150 Gaelscoil agus 30,000 dalta attending all Irish schools daily, gan trácht ar na coláistí. Tá suim agus tacaíocht, brú úr agus meas úr ar an Ghaeilge nach raibh ann san am sin. Má bhí eagla ar an Rialtas i 1972, ní chóir go mbeidh aon eagla air anois nuair a fheicfidh sé an fás mór atá ag teacht ar an tacaíocht don Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre.Nuair a bunaíodh Raidió na Gaeltachta, búpla uair sa lá a bhí sé ag craoladh. Inniu tá Raidió na Gaeltachta ag craoladh ar fud na tíre 24 uair sa lá, seacht lá na seachtain gach seachtain sa bhliain. Ní amháin go bhfuil sé le fáil sa tír seo ach tá sé le fáil ar fud an domhain. Bím ag éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta maidin Shathairn agus bíonn daoine i San Francisco agus na Philipines agus New Zealand ag cur scéalta isteach agus iad ag rá go bhfuil siad ag éisteacht leis. Ní thuigim an teicneolaíocht ach tuigim go bhfuil daoine amuigh ansin agus suim acu bheith ag éisteacht leis an raidió. Ó tharla go bhfuil mé ag caint ar na háiteacha seo, tá mé cinnte go bhfuil ceannairí na bpáirtí ag fáil téacsanna agus ríomhphoist ó San Francisco, Boston, Princeton agus ón Astráil ag rá linn aitheantas oifigiúil a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.Tá feachtas sa tír seo agus in aon áit ina bhfuil Éireannaigh ar fud an domhain. Chonaic mé an fógra a bhí sna nuachtáin náisiúnta ag an deireadh seachtaine agus bhí trí chuid ann. Bhí móruaisle na tíre ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas an stádas seo a éileamh don Ghaeilge — polaiteoirí, acadúlaí, ealaíontóirí, scríbhneoirí, lucht scannáin, ceoltóírí agus go leor eile. Ina dhiaidh sin bhí na heagrais agus páirtithe polaitíochta — Lucht Oibre, an Chomhaontas Glas, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, an t-iomlán againn. Bhí dhá pháirtí, áfach, nach raibh luaite anseo, agus tá seo tábhachtach, na páirithe atá sa Rialtas, Fianna Fáil agus na PDs. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach bhfuil siad ag tabhairt tacaíochta don éileamh seo atá ag teacht ó gach duine ar fud na tíre agus taobh amuigh den tír. Taobh leis sin bhí na húdaráis áitiúla agus ní raibh comhairle chondae nó údarás áitiúil sa tír nár ghlac rún tacaíochta le stádas a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. Ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil lucht tacaíochta an Rialtais i gComhairle Chondae Dhún na nGall, comhairlí condae atá ina mball de Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil agus ina mball de Pháirtí na nDaonlathaí, ag tabhairt tacaíochta dó seo mar nuair a thagann siad go dtí Baile Átha Cliath go dtí an Rialtas, tá an doras dúnta.

Tá an Ghaeilge faoi bhrú sa Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire, admhaíonn an tAire féin sin; éinne atá ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht, tuigeann sé sin. Dá ndéanfadh an Rialtas gníomh mar seo, áfach, thabharfadh sé spreagadh do mhuintir óga na Gaeltachta a rá gur fiú an Ghaeilge a choinneáil, gur fiú staidéar a dhéanamh uirthi, ardcháilíochta a bhaint mar beidh fostaíochta le fáil mar gheall air.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am grateful for being allowed to raise the issue of the proposed constitution for Europe and the concerns of many citizens. This is an important debate as it is important we discuss ideas which involve a large percentage of our people. It is important that the Minister of State and the Government listen to an alternative view of Europe and world politics in general. I am an internationalist and I believe in treating all states with respect and dignity. Sadly, many in this House do not share that view and often dismiss it in these debates.I have five main concerns about the proposed constitution for Europe. I ask the fundamental questions about the direction the EU is taking and these concerns deserve to be heard in any democratic state. People want to know if the proposed constitution will have primacy over the Irish Constitution and if EU Presidents and Prime Ministers can change the voting system for policy areas without the consent of national Parliament or peoples. They also want to know if the constitution enshrines the concept of a common defence policy and if our human rights can be limited to meet the objectives of general interests recognised by the European Union. People also want straight answers to questions, particularly if the constitution facilitates the commercialisation of health and education. These are the issues I want to deal with in more detail.Article 1(10) of the constitution states: "The constitution and the law adopted by the union's institutions in exercising competencies conferred on it shall have primacy over the laws of member states." This clearly means that if the proposed constitution is accepted by the Irish electorate at referendum, it will have primacy over the Irish Constitution. We can then no longer consider ourselves independent, but will enjoy a status in international and even domestic affairs akin to that of a state of the US or Australia. We will become a small state in a federal Europe of at least 25 states, with little influence over our future.Article 1-40(2) unambiguously states: "The common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of a common defence policy for the union. This will lead to a common defence, when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides". Article 1-40(3) makes it clear that: "Member States shall make military and civilian capabilities available" to the union, while Article 1-40(1) proposes that "The Union may deploy them on tasks outside the Union". Mutual defence will be a component of common defence, as is made clear in Article 1-40(7). This Article also commits us to increase military spending through our agreement to "undertake progressively to improve military capabilities." If we accept this Constitution, we become constitutionally committed to the achievement of a common defence.There can be no evasion or turning back. The gradual erosion of military neutrality over a succession of referenda will culminate in our becoming a full and active member of an aggressive military alliance mandated to operate outside its borders and have a mutual defence pact obliging us to give aid and assistance by all means in our military power to any other member state which is a victim of armed aggression on its territory. The only aspect of this scenario which cannot be predicted is how soon it will happen. That will be totally in the hands of the European Council if this constitution is accepted.Regarding the constitution facilitating the commercialisation of health and education, there is a power of veto on commercialisation — a buzz word for privatisation — of health and education, and cultural services. The proposed constitution moves decisions on trade and these services to qualified majority voting. Article 3-2(171) outlines the common commercial policy as a fundamental element of the EU. It is based on uniform principles regarding the conclusion of tariff and trade agreements related to trade in goods and services and to uniformity in measures of liberalisation. This policy will determine those aspects of service that are commercial and then proceed in secret to liberalise them. There will be no minutes of the Commission or Council debates on these issues as they decide which are the commercial aspects of these services. They would then be empowered to make agreements with the World Trade Organisation, allowing international trade in these services. This measure in the proposed constitution signals the end of social Europe and the increased privileging of those who can afford to pay for basis services. It also opens up a lucrative market in necessary services while at the same time secretly determines the economic and social policies to be followed by member states.These are the issues that concern me. I urge caution and more informed debate. We are treading a dangerous path if the Government and the three major political parties try pulling the wool over people's eyes.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	542	As the House will be aware, work on a new draft constitutional treaty for the European Union began at the European Convention almost two years ago. The Convention was asked to bring forward recommendations for a new, more simple treaty which would help bring the Union closer to its citizens, make it clearer to them who does what and at what level, and help the Union play a more active and effective role on the world stage.The European Convention finished its work last summer. In welcoming its recommendations, the European Council described the Convention's draft text as a good basis for the work of the intergovernmental conference. The IGC, in which final decisions on the new treaty will be taken by Governments, got under way last October. The Government set out its approach to the various issues involved on many occasions.As it was not possible to conclude the IGC under the Italian Presidency, the European Council in December asked the Irish Presidency to consult partners, to assess the prospects for progress and to report to its meeting at the end of March. The Government, in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are now intensively engaged in that process. As the Taoiseach has made clear, we intend to make the fullest possible report in March. If there are serious prospects of bringing the IGC to an early conclusion, the Government will move immediately to seize that opportunity.It is clear that the overwhelming bulk of what was proposed by the Convention will stand. This is very much in the interests of our citizens. The new constitutional treaty is a project of great importance to them. It is important that it address their real needs and concerns. I look forward to the continuing debate on its contents which will take place in this House and elsewhere, including in the National Forum on Europe. I take heart from the results of the recently published Eurobarometer opinion survey which show that support for the European Union among the Irish public remains high and that a significant majority believes that the Union should have a constitution.The draft constitutional treaty recommended by the Convention is a simple document. It draws together the existing complex treaties into a single logical text. It uses plainer language. It incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with a clearer description of its scope and application. It describes clearly the distribution of competences, or powers, between the Union and the member states. Significantly, for the first time the text contains a clear statement of the fundamental principles under which the Union must operate. Under the principle of conferral, it only has those powers that the member states expressly confer upon it. For example, member states retain primary responsibility in such areas as health, education and culture. Under proportionality, the Union may only act to the extent necessary. Under subsidiarity, it may act only where the intended aim cannot be achieved by the member states alone or where it can better be achieved at Union level.These principles are given new teeth. National Parliaments, the elected institutions with which our citizens identify most closely, will play a new role in ensuring that subsidiarity is respected. If they believe that a legislative proposal breaches the principle, they can oblige the Commission to think again. The Government has warmly welcomed these proposals.Some were concerned that the Convention's proposals on defence did not adequately reflect the diversity of positions held by member states in this highly sensitive area. Considerable work was carried out under the Italian Presidency. It brought forward amended texts before the summit meeting in December. These received a broad welcome both from member states sharing Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality and from member states that participate actively in NATO. While the Intergovernmental Conference is proceeding on a "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" basis, I expect the excellent work carried out by the Italian Presidency to be fully reflected in any text eventually agreed.The Convention also proposed new arrangements for the Union's institutions. These are being considered carefully in the Intergovernmental Conference. One of its most innovative suggestions was the creation of a Union Foreign Minister drawing together responsibility for the Union's external activities in the Commission and the Council. While some details remain to be ironed out, there has been widespread support for this idea. The Government believes it should help to bring greater efficiency and coherence to the Union's approach.The IGC is also looking at future arrangements for the Commission. Some member states hold a strong view that, as the size of the Union increases, a smaller Commission is necessary to ensure its effectiveness. Others take the view that an arrangement for one Commissioner per member state, at least for a period, gives greater legitimacy to the Commission's actions. If there is to be a successful conclusion to the IGC, a balanced outcome will have to be found.A way forward will also have to be found on the difficult question of voting in the Council. The convention proposed a move away from the weighted votes that apply under Nice towards a dual majority system. For a proposal to be successful, this would require the support of a given percentage of member states representing a given percentage of the Union's population. Some support this proposal.

It is sad to think that, since he first published his research, the vaccination rates for the MMR vaccine have dropped to between 50% and 75% in certain vulnerable communities. There has been a number of outbreaks of measles in those years where we have seen at least three children die in Dublin and a number of others left very sick. The Minister knows well what I am talking about when I refer to the drop in vaccine rates and the hardship it has caused in vulnerable communities.It is difficult to know how this information can be spread but I ask the Minister to use the full resources of his Department to highlight the fact that this research, which has caused such a scare across the world and not only in Ireland and in the UK, should be refuted. A public campaign should begin immediately to try to get vaccination rates for the MMR vaccine back to up to 95%.The Minister, his officials and I always believed this research was, to say the least, flawed. I vaccinated two of my children with the MMR vaccine during the course of this controversy. However, there are many parents who have withheld their children from being vaccinated. There have been many calls for single vaccines to be given to children which does not necessarily solve the problem. How will we restore public confidence in our immunisation scheme? It is a serious issue.On many occasions in this House we discuss issues such as radiotherapy and cancer treatment but we seldom approach the more difficult topic of preventative medicine. Vaccination is one of the most outstanding examples of how preventative medicine can be successful. I assume the Minister is aware of the report in a Sunday newspaper because it is such a topical issue for his Department. Does he have any plans to get the media back on side? The media ran with this research when it was first reported. There was a large press conference in the Royal Free Hospital in London. Since that time the link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been almost unquestioned, even though numerous investigations and studies from America and Europe have disproved the theory or have said there is no link. Given the flawed and questionable reputation of Dr. Wakefield, I hope the media tell parents the vaccine is safe and that they should get their children vaccinated.The vaccination rate has now dropped below the rate where the whole community can be protected. It is only a matter of time before there is a fairly serious measles outbreak and, just like the last time it happened, not only in Ireland but in Holland, Italy and the UK, children will die. For some reason, it was acceptable to see children die from a preventable illness because of inadequate research that made a hopeless link between autism and the MMR vaccine and which received much press coverage. I would like that counteracted immediately. I say "well done" to the Minister on this issue. He held his nerve and constantly highlighted the fact the vaccine was important. I would like the Minister, his Department and the media to counteract all this nonsense that has gone on in this controversy over the past five years.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I thank Dr. Twomey for raising this matter and for his contribution. Measles is a highly infectious and serious disease. Approximately one in 15 children who contract measles will suffer serious complications. The MMR vaccine protects against this disease and can be administered to children at 12 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from measles and to stop the spread of the disease in the community.I am concerned about the unsatisfactory MMR immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.Based on information available from the National Disease Surveillance Centre, there was a significant increase in 2003 in the number of reported measles cases. In 2002, 243 cases were reported but provisional returns for 2003 indicate that there were 586 measles cases that year. This underlines the importance of raising the immunisation uptake level to the optimal level of 95% against measles and the other potentially serious infections. In 2003, chief executive officers in all health boards and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority were asked to ensure that specific immunisation measures were prioritised in all regions to prevent a serious measles outbreak.The health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The Minister for Health and Children launched the report of the steering committee in April 2002 and a national implementation group was subsequently established to draw up a phased national implementation plan based on the report's recommendations.Following consideration of proposals submitted by the national implementation group through the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards in regard to childhood immunisation, €2.116 million was allocated by the Department in 2003 to fund initiatives to improve childhood immunisation uptake. A further €2.778 million has been allocated this year. I am encouraged by the most recent statistics from the NDSC for the third quarter of 2003 which show that MMR uptake at 24 months was 81% increasing from 77% in the previous quarter.There is concern among some parents in regard to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. In April 2002, the Minister, Deputy Martin, launched the MMR vaccine discussion pack, an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the NDSC and the department of public health in the Southern Health Board and was published by HeBE on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in regard to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in regard to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision.The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in a question and answer format and it addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR, autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will enable health professionals to respond to the very real concerns of parents.There is a sound evidence basis for the use of the MMR vaccine. Since the original publication of UK research from Dr. Wakefield about a possible causal link between MMR vaccine and autism, many researchers have investigated the proposed causal relationship and concluded that there is no link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The Department's submission to the Oireachtas committee contains further details on the scientific evidence in this regard. In Ireland, this issue has been examined by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's immunisation committee and the Irish Medicines Board. The conclusions are that there is no evidence to support the association between MMR vaccines and the development of autism or inflammatory bowel disease, and that the vaccine is safer than giving the three component vaccines separately. The Oireachtas committee has also endorsed the safety of the MMR vaccine.The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. The institutions include the Medical Research Council's expert committee and the British Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK, the centres for disease control and prevention, and the American Academy of Paediatrics, as well as the World Health Organisation.Studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease.I take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme, to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. This is particularly important at present in light of the increase in reported measles cases.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the draft nitrates directive action programme, which has been drawn up by the Irish Farmers Association. Having consulted widely, including with well respected environmental, agronomic and soil science technical experts, the IFA has concluded that the directive is unnecessary, unworkable and unaffordable.Water quality in Ireland is improving and the farming community is committed to protecting the quality of clean water across the country. Farmers are guardians of the countryside and its heritage and have long recognised the importance of protecting the natural environment in its own right and as a vital resource base for agriculture and the food industry. The clean environment we enjoy is largely a legacy from the many generations of farmers whose activities over the years contributed to our high quality of countryside. Our water resources are an integral feature of this environment. Irish agriculture is predominantly grass-based extensive livestock farming, which contrasts markedly with the highly concentrated arable and livestock production systems of other EU member states.Successive reforms of the CAP have favoured extensive production with lower stocking densities resulting in a reduction of fertiliser and feed inputs. Approximately 38,500 farmers, or one third of all farmers in the country, are participating in the REP scheme, which requires participants to enter into contractual programmes with the Government and the European Union to meet high environmental and heritage protection standards. Since 1994, intensive agricultural enterprises in Ireland are subject to integrated control licensing, meeting standards on a par with the highest environmental standards for industry in Europe. All these environmental protection measures have been undertaken at a significant investment cost to individual farmers. Gross investment in farm buildings in the last decade totalled over €2,000 million. Environmental protection through improved manure storage and handling facilities features heavily in all farm building expenditure.The measures proposed are unnecessary in the context of the overall excellent and improving quality of Irish waters, changes that have occurred and are forecast to take place in livestock numbers and fertiliser usage, the likely effects of CAP reform phase 3, the introduction of the single farm payment and the significant participation by farmers in the rural environment protection scheme.The particular measures proposed in the draft action programme are unworkable and are removed from the practical realities of farming in Ireland. In particular, the IFA has highlighted the excessive nature of the demands that will be imposed on farmers arising from the proposed closed periods for the land application of fertilisers, the minimum manure storage requirements on farms, even where water quality is regarded as excellent, and the unreasonable compliance and bureaucratic burden that will be imposed on farmers arising from these measures.The measures proposed in the draft action programme are unaffordable because of static and declining farm incomes and the cost to farmers of complying with the proposed measures. In this context, the IFA has analysed trends in farm incomes and the outlook for incomes following the decoupling of farm supports from production with the introduction of a single farm payment from 2005.The Minister should ensure that a workable agreement with the Government on an action programme is made, which does not undermine farmers' livelihoods and which, together with action from industry and local authorities, will meet the requirements of the nitrates directive on water quality.Farm organisations are not saying that the nitrates directive should not be implemented, but that it should be agreed to assure proper water quality. The IFA's president, Mr. John Dillon, has said it is the association's considered opinion that the measures proposed in the Government's draft action programme to control and regulate farmers in regard to water quality are unnecessary, unworkable and unaffordable. They are totally at odds with the realities of farm incomes, which are under pressure. Mr. Dillon is seeking an agreement which will not undermine farmers' livelihoods and which, together with action by other sectors, including local government, will meet the requirements of the nitrates directive on water quality.The restrictions being imposed on farmers are excessive and impractical. Independent consultants have put the cost of the additional storage requirements alone for farmers at over €1 billion, which is an impossible financial burden in view of the serious income pressures faced by farmers due to CAP reform and the World Trade Organisation regulations.According to the IFA, the measures proposed are unnecessary in the context of the overall excellent and improving quality of Irish waters, changes in livestock numbers and fertiliser usage, the likely effects of the Fischler CAP reforms and the participation of a projected 50,000 farmers in the rural environment protection scheme.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which is of considerable importance to the farming community and many other interested parties. Directive 91/676/EEC, known as the nitrates directive, came into effect in January 1992 and deals with the protection of waters against pollution from agricultural sources. The primary emphasis of the directive is on the better management of livestock manure and other fertilisers.The directive has been implemented in Ireland since 1992 by way of a wide range of measures taken by farmers and the relevant public authorities for the monitoring of water quality, the promotion of good agricultural practice on a general basis, together with specific measures for the protection of water quality against pollution in a farming context. There has been extensive investment by many farmers in the provision of waste storage facilities and other infrastructure. Nutrient management planning is widely applied and there has been a considerable reduction in the use of certain chemical fertilisers. In 1996 a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was issued jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food and provides clear guidance for farmers. This code of practice is supported by the main farming organisations.Recent data on water pollution indicate that additional measures are needed in an agricultural context to protect and improve water quality. A draft action programme for further implementation of the directive was prepared and issued for consultation on 19 December 2003 with an invitation to all interested parties to provide written comments within two months. The draft programme was issued jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food. It provides for a range of measures to strengthen the application of good housekeeping rules in regard to farming in all areas. These measures relate to the timing and procedures for the land application of fertilisers, limits on the land application of fertilisers, livestock manure storage and the monitoring of the effectiveness of such measures.All comments received regarding the draft action programme will be considered initially by officials from the two Departments. The extent to which the draft programme might need to be revised on the basis of these comments will be considered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. There will be appropriate liaison with interested parties.A high priority attaches to the development and implementation of an effective action programme under the directive, especially because the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy from 1 January 2005 onwards is conditional on satisfactory implementation of specified European Community legislation, including the nitrates directive. There is a need to finalise the terms of the action programme at an early date and submit definitive proposals to the European Commission. Representatives of the farming organisations will meet officials of the relevant Departments later this week to consider the matter further.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Government decision of December 2002, which provided for a very substantial increase in the television licence fee, also introduced a new mechanism for determining the future level of the licence fee. The Government decision provided for an annual adjustment of the television licence fee using a consumer price index minus X formula to take account of rising costs but also to reflect RTE's performance on execution of change management and programme commitments.My decision to grant RTE an increase of €2 in the licence fee was informed by the report of an independent evaluation of RTE's performance in 2003, that was undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers. When announcing the decision to increase the television licence fee, I recognised that RTE had achieved a significant amount in 2003, particularly with respect to delivery of programme output; near achievement of its budget target; and delivery of accountability and transparency measures. I also highlighted that RTE had less success in terms of the implementation of its change programme.The chairman of RTE welcomed the increase in the licence fee, while saying that RTE would have preferred a higher figure. He also expressed some concern at the language used in my press release. I do not consider it particularly helpful to engage in a lengthy public debate on this matter. I have spoken to the chairman about his concerns and the chairman understands the position taken by me on the issue. I had a duty to explain to the public the circumstances in which they would be asked to pay an increased licence fee. As a result, my statement reflected the positive achievements of RTE in 2003 and also referred to where there could have been a better result.

This review will be undertaken later this year and the terms of reference for the review will be published once they have been drawn up. I intend to engage independent experts to undertake this review. In drawing up the terms of reference for the review, I will take account of the fact that the Competition Authority recently concluded its consideration of a request from TV3 to take up a complaint against RTE for alleged predatory pricing on advertising.

It also provides for Bord Iascaigh Mhara to relocate to Clonakilty while the Central Fisheries Board will move to Carrick-on-Shannon.Following this announcement, my Department conducted an informal survey of staff in January last to determine preliminary levels of interest in decentralising to any of the designated locations. The results of the survey showed that approximately 7% of respondents were interested in moving to Cavan; 28% expressed interest in other locations; and a further 24% fell into the "don't know" category.I stress that this exercise was very much a point in time straw poll and that staff did not have the benefit of specific details regarding work areas being relocated, timing of decentralisation or in respect of facilities and amenities in the Cavan area. Since the survey was carried out, an information pack compiled by Cavan County Council has been distributed to all staff in my Department. This provides details on availability and price of housing, educational facilities, health services, and sports and recreational facilities.The Office of Public Works, which is co-ordinating the property aspects of the decentralisation programme, is currently carrying out an initial assessment of proposals received from the owners of sites and properties in the designated locations and will report to the implementation group as well as liaise with individual Departments. The provision of high quality office accommodation for staff will be a primary consideration in the assessment of the property options in all locations.The Central Fisheries Board, CFB, has not conducted a staff survey on decentralisation. BIM is currently carrying out a preliminary survey, but the results are not yet available.

It has initiated positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short, medium and longer terms, as forecast by ESB national grid in its generation adequacy report published on 27 November 2003.Short-term measures put in place for this winter include the implementation by ESB national grid of a demand side management programme, increased imports of 167MW of electricity from Northern Ireland contracted on a priority basis and 104MW of additional peaking capacity operational since last December.As to the capacity deficit in the medium to longer term, the CER's recently run competition addresses this situation by facilitating the entry of two new independent generating plants with a combined installed generating capacity of over 500MW. As regards ESB plant productivity a programme is in place to enhance its availability from some 76% in 2003 to a target of 82% during 2004.ESB is currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme, of €4 billion up to 2007, to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.As regards interconnection, the Government has given its approval to proceed with the development of two 500MW interconnectors between Ireland and Great Britain, while the desirability and feasibility of further interconnection North-South is being investigated.As demonstrated by recent international blackout events, no electricity power system can be fully protected from all eventualities. However, the transmission system operator has in place specific plans to deal with any incident quickly and effectively whereby supply is matched to demand.At EU level, the Commission has brought forward a draft directive proposing measures to safeguard security of supply. The directive forms part of a new energy infrastructure and security of supply legislative package, designed in the main to promote investment in the European energy sector with a view to both strengthening competition and helping to prevent the reoccurrence of electricity blackouts.

Key elements of this programme include 14 sealice inspections at each marine fish farm each year and at least one fish health inspection at each fish farm annually. Inspections of fish farms are also carried out by the engineering division of my Department. In 2003, 51 of these inspections were carried out at marine fish farm sites and 44 were undertaken at freshwater sites.In addition, a monitoring and sampling programme for residues is carried out by the Marine Institute each year in accordance with EU Directive 96/23. The programme involves monitoring for a wide range of residues including antibiotics and environmental contaminants. Fish farm operations are also scrutinised through returns and reports that are required to be made to my Department by the companies concerned. These include, for example, reports on the benthic conditions under and adjacent to sea cages.I have indicated to the House previously that I am committed to having effective monitoring and control systems for aquaculture so that we can be assured of having a well regulated industry operating to appropriately high standards. My Department is, therefore, in the process of undertaking a detailed review of the existing regulatory systems. This exercise is now at an advanced stage and will be finalised shortly. The review will consider, in particular, how existing systems and processes may need to be refined or reinforced to ensure the optimal operation of monitoring and control programmes. It will address also what action, if any, is required in respect of enforcement measures and procedures. If it is apparent, following the review, that changes are required to legislation or procedures or practices, then these changes will be introduced without delay.

Currently, the five fishery harbour centres, Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs, are owned by my Department and are directly managed by the Department under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts 1968 to 1998. Section 4(1) of the 1968 Act requires that I manage, control, operate and develop each of the fishery harbour centres. Section 6 of that Act places specific responsibility on me in regard to maintenance, repair, improvement, extension and modification of the harbour including buildings and road access.In 2001, my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, established a review group to consider suitable future structures for the harbours. This review group was chaired by Professor Jim Ward of UCG and comprised representatives of each of the five fishery harbour centres and Dingle together with representatives of the Department, BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta. The group considered a range of options, however, it was not possible to achieve consensus on the way forward. Management arrangements for the fishery harbour centres are subject to ongoing review in the context of further streamlining of the executive functions of the Department. The position of Dingle harbour will be considered in the context of that review.In many respects, Dingle has the benefits of fishery harbour centre status in that for capital investment purposes Dingle is treated as a fishery harbour centre and the commissioners are not expected to contribute the normal 25% towards development works, which is required in respect of other harbours. Apart altogether from the ongoing review of executive functions at my Department, there are various arrangements to be put in place before Dingle can be designated as a fishery harbour centre.

I met the board of An Post in October and expressed the importance of the early agreement and implementation of the recovery strategy with specified savings and timescales for delivery. A core element of the strategy is a change management programme, which is subject to discussion and agreement with the relevant trade unions in An Post. I understand talks on the change management element of the recovery strategy are ongoing with the trade unions in An Post with the exception of one union, the Communications Workers Union, CWU. The final agreement on the plan is obviously contingent of the outcome of these negotiations. Provisional numbers in terms of staffing reductions amounting to approximately 1,500 are envisaged by the company at this stage.In regard to the implementation of the ESOP, the transfer of shares to employees is dependent on the achievement of specified cost savings. My Department is in correspondence with the board of An Post on the verification of the cost savings which would trigger any initial transfer of shareholding to employees. However, overall policy on the ESOP has not changed. The Government is still committed to the ESOP process if it can be demonstrated that real transformation has occurred and that the cost savings agreed as part of the ESOP have been achieved.

The INPC has already paid €20 million to the Exchequer.In November 2003, the board of the INPC, cognisant of its obligations under the Companies Acts to retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities, determined that it would not be appropriate to make a further payment to the Exchequer at that stage as a number of outstanding matters have still to be resolved. These matters, comprising chiefly environmental claims lodged against the INPC and a contractual dispute with a former customer, have potential financial implications and consequently the INPC is not currently in a position to divest itself of its remaining financial assets.It has always been accepted that the total cash return to the Exchequer arising from the INPC transaction would be considerably less than the headline sale price of $100 million as the INPC had, for example, to use some of the proceeds to discharge the company's debt.I am satisfied, however, that the transaction represented a very positive outcome for the State, particularly having regard to the fact that the Government also placed an obligation on the private owners to operate the facilities for a period of at least 15 years as a condition of the sale.

As proceedings may follow from these investigations, it would not be appropriate to comment on the matter at this time. The events at Inver Bay in 2002 arose from an operating accident at the fish farm concerned about which the company failed to inform the Department. On investigation, the Department found that a substantial number of dead salmon had been left on the seabed beneath one of the fish cages. The Department required the company to have a report on the situation, and on how best to deal with it, prepared by consultants. On receipt of this report, it was determined, with the advice of the Marine Institute that the best way of dealing with the matter was to leave the dead fish in situ.The company was further required to have regular monitoring of the affected area of the seabed carried out by consultants and to furnish reports of the monitoring to the Department. These reports have shown a satisfactory recovery and return to normal of the seabed conditions. It was decided at the time by the Department, taking account of all of the circumstances, not to initiate a prosecution in respect of the events in Inver Bay in 2002.

The key aspects of the charter are as follows: it outlines RTE's statutory mandate; it explains the guiding principles under which RTE will operate; and it describes what RTE commits to in terms of the provision of services and in terms of accountability.There has been significant consultation with RTE during the process of drawing up the charter. An initial draft charter was included with RTE's application for a television licence fee increase in 2002. My officials have also had a series of discussions with senior management in RTE over the past year regarding the charter. RTE also made a detailed submission to my Department last year dealing with issues raised in the submissions received during the public consultation process.The trade union group in RTE made a submission on the charter as part of the public consultation process. Officials from my Department met the group recently and discussed elements of the group's submission. I intend to bring the finalised charter to Government very shortly after which I will arrange for its publication.

The legislation places the development agency for the hub on a statutory footing and the agency is charged with the development of the hub.The digital hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector, intends to provide a high quality environment for Irish and international new media companies, research and development, along with educational and community initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. The digital content industry has been identified by our development agencies as a high growth, value added industry where this country already exhibits significant strengths.The digital hub is currently conducting negotiations to select a preferred developer for the refurbishment of seven acres of development space. Three consortia have bid for the development contract. These bids are currently being evaluated and a recommendation is expected to be made to me in early April 2004.

I understand that my colleague and Minister of State, Deputy Browne, met with the National Salmon Commission on Thursday last and that the commission’s recommendations, including the proposed commercial catch quotas, for the operation of the scheme in 2004 are now imminent.Once I have received these recommendations from the commission, my Department will proceed to finalise the draft regulations to give effect to any proposed adjustments. It is my intention to publish the draft regulations for a 30-day consultation period in early March in accordance with the requirements of the Fisheries Acts. During this time, interested parties will have an opportunity to submit any objections they may have. Following the receipt and consideration of these, I will then make a final decision on the scheme.

The European Commission has issued letters of formal notice in the case of the following two directives: 2002/84/EC, which was due to be transposed on 23 November 2003. Nine of the ten legislative measures required for transposition of this directive are in place. The remaining measure has proven to be particularly complex and difficult and my Department is working to resolve the issues in close consultation with the Attorney's General office; and 2002/59/EC, which was due to be transposed on 5 February 2004.

One of these draft directions focuses on cross-Border roaming. It mandates ComReg to identify barriers, and use the tools available to them to encourage and support initiatives to reduce or eliminate roaming charges between Ireland and Northern Ireland.As a Minister from a Border county, I am acutely aware of the impact of these charges on local people and local businesses. The issue is not simply one of mobile operators introducing all-Ireland tariffs, although this in itself is to be welcomed.These directions have been published in draft format for public consultation until Monday, 1 March 2004 and I welcome input from both the industry and the public.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	562	The measures under which the Irish fishing fleet operates are governed by the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy. Within this framework, there is a wide range of conservation measures already in place in Community waters generally and these apply to all EU fishing fleets.The basic objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is to provide for the sustainable exploitation of resources, taking account of the environmental, economic and social aspects in a balanced manner. This fundamental objective is ongoing in nature and will continue to be the driving force underpinning CFP actions and initiatives.In so far as the waters around Ireland specifically are concerned, there has been a number of noteworthy conservation measures and developments within the past year. These include the successful outcome to the Irish Box issue under which fishing effort levels of fishing fleets, both Irish and otherwise, will be curtailed. Decisions were also taken within the past year to strengthen recovery measures for cod stocks in the Irish Sea and off the north-west coast of Ireland and for the hake stock off the south and west coast.Notwithstanding these specific improvements in resource conservation, it is important to plan for strengthened conservation measures for the future. To that end, I have arranged for a major conference to be held in Ireland next month to consider in detail the specific subject of how best to fast-track the further development of environmentally-friendly fishing methods. This conference will be attended by Commissioner Fischler and several Fisheries Ministers from inside and outside the EU and representatives of the various stakeholders.I believe that the initiative of the Irish presidency in convening this major conference will contribute in a significant way to sustainable management and development of fishery resources.

Since assuming office, my main goal has been to implement this policy in a coherent way using the tools available to me to improve the range and quality of services available to consumers, by facilitating growth and the introduction of more innovation and competition in the sector.I have recently published draft policy directions which, after the statutory consultation process and subject to any amendments, I propose to give to the Communications Regulator. One of the directions focuses on competition as a key objective for 2004 and one focuses on national roaming.These draft directions mandate ComReg to: implement where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support, in all ways possible, entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players; and to use its powers to mandate national roaming on existing GSM networks of incumbent mobile network operators on fair commercial terms subject to relevant requirements under European law.These directions have been published in draft format for public consultation until Monday 1 March 2004 and I welcome input from both the industry and the public. My message is simple: the more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy as a whole.

This is the case with the existing interconnection between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland through the Moyle interconnector.The Deputy may wish to note that with the implementation of the Electricity Directive, all electricity suppliers will be required to specify in or with the electricity bills and in promotional material made available to final customers, the contribution of each energy source to the overall fuel mix of the supplier over the preceding year. This Directive is scheduled to be transposed into Irish law by 1 July 2004, whereas the earliest possible date for commencement of construction work on an East-West interconnector is end 2006.I am confident, given the known popular opposition to nuclear energy in Ireland, that suppliers would not knowingly contract for electricity imports clearly traceable to nuclear stations or that Irish consumers would knowingly buy any. There is simply no business case for selling nuclear energy in Ireland.

The Government recognises the importance of a balanced regional rollout of broadband, and in this regard is taking a series of initiatives to support and complement investment by the private companies operating in the market.An indicative €200 million was set aside for the current programme of broadband infrastructure developments under the NDP 2000-2006. This includes funding for 19 metropolitan area networks in towns and cities across the country, the extension of digital subscriber lines by both Eircom and Esat BT, the construction of a 1,300 kilometre fibre trunk network by the ESB, and other regional broadband investment initiatives.The MANs are now nearing completion, and will begin coming on stream in mid-2004. DSL rollout has now reach over 900,000 lines countrywide, and the ESB telecoms fibre trunk was completed recently.Recent figures released by ComReg show the dramatic increase in the take-up of broadband in Ireland in the past year. Ireland can also boast one of the highest internet penetration levels in Europe with more than 50,000 customers accessing the internet though flat rate packages offered by Eircom Net and other internet service providers.There are now more than 32,000 DSL subscribers nationally, compared with 1,000 in March 2003, and the number is increasing every month. Ireland can also boast, at 30%, one of the highest digital TV penetration rates in Europe.Last December, I announced my Department's broadband action plan outlining the proposals to stimulate broadband-capable infrastructural investment throughout Ireland. The key elements of the plan include the provision of broadband infrastructure in more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and more, using community broadband exchanges and strategic fibre. A new group broadband scheme, similar to the group water schemes, is proposed for smaller communities to pool their broadband requirements and secure high speed connectivity from a range of service providers, with grant assistance from the Government.An annual spend of €35 million between now and 2007 has been committed to the broadband action plan in partnership with the local authorities and in co-operation with the telecoms industry here. Operational details for the broadband action plan are now being finalised, and I expect to be able to make a full announcement shortly.It is possible to obtain broadband services in most places in Ireland at the moment, and my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas and the names and contact numbers for all service providers.

Several analysts are of the view that there will be resultant windfall gains, notably in the electricity generation sector.Consultants who advised the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government suggested that, in certain circumstances, and based on a postulated cost of carbon of €10 per tonne, that wholesale electricity prices here could increase by 14% leading to a retail increase of7%. This would be lower than the average increase postulated for the EU. I am considering, in conjunction with the Commission for Energy Regulation, what options and measures might be available to mitigate the windfall factor to minimise or eliminate increases in the consumer prices of electricity.

This review is to be completed in two stages over six months and the consultants expect to be in a position to report to me on the first stage by late March. The consultants, as part of this first phase, have undertaken a comprehensive consultation process during which more than 60 submissions from relevant stakeholders and interested parties were received.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	576	As I explained in reply to Question No. 606 on 27 January, the ban on religious advertising as provided for in section 20(4) of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, as qualified by section 65 of the Broadcasting Act 2001, and section 10(3) of the Radio and Television Act 1988, should remain.In arriving at my decision, I had regard to a diverse range of opinions expressed during a public consultation process I conducted last year. In arriving at the view that the ban should remain I was conscious of the potential intrusive nature of advertising on radio and television, which is different to other forms of advertising. It is not desirable that individual groups would be in a position to buy air time to deliver an unchallenged message aimed at influencing and altering behaviour in society in circumstances where it is difficult for the public to test or verify positions advanced.Section 65 of the Broadcasting Act 2001 provides that the ban on religious advertising does not preclude the broadcasting of a notice of the fact that a particular religious newspaper, magazine or periodical is available for sale or supply or that any event or ceremony associated with any particular religion will take place, if the contents of the notice do not address the issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation. Submissions received as part of the consultation process together with a report on the consultation process itself and the documents that set out the basis for my decision, are available on my Department's website.

The economic goals for a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume and the development of salmon angling as an important tourism product are both fully compatible with the primary objective. The current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice by next year hold out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long term sustainable fishery for both sectors. As a result, I have no plans to introduce a single stock management system for the commercial catch of wild Irish salmon but I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of the policy outlined.

Previously, it was indicated that funding of up to €1.9 million would be available subject to stringent conditions.Under the Harbours Act 1946, a harbour authority is required to seek the Minister's consent for any financial commitment regarding infrastructural works. In August 2002, it was belatedly brought to the attention of my Department by Bantry Bay harbour commissioners that they had entered into a contract in respect of the pier development. The harbour commissioners were subsequently advised that, pending clarification on all financial issues relating to the project, the contractors were not to proceed with the project or incur additional expenditure. Advice has been sought on various legal issues pertaining to the pier development and a response is awaited from the Attorney General in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	581	As the Deputy will be aware, my responsibility lies in developing and implementing public policy that ensures broadband services are widely available at an affordable price in the Irish market, whether such services are provided for citizens, businesses or schools. The case for the provision of broadband to all primary and secondary schools is compelling, particularly with regard to improving and ensuring the quality of the education experience; access to global information sources; the possibilities of communication and collaboration between school communities, at home and abroad; a seamless transition from second to third level education; the skills required for competitiveness of the economy; and the inclusion of geographically remote schools.In addition, it is likely that the provision of broadband to schools will drive demand and deployment of broadband technologies within the wider community. My Department has been working with the Department of Education and Science to develop plans for such provision. During 2003 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a consultancy study on the options for providing broadband to schools around the country taking into account the practical issues of market ability to provide such connectivity, the range of delivery technologies available, timescale for delivery, cost and scale.Since the completion of this report in August 2003, detailed discussions have taken place between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the telecommunications industry regarding the allocation of resources from both industry and Government to ensure such provision and a timescale for implementation. I am pleased that agreement was reached with the telecommunications industry, represented by the telecommunications and Internet federation of IBEC, earlier today regarding the provisioning of broadband to schools. This agreement involves a voluntary commitment of €15 million over three years by the telecommunications sector, augmented by a Government contribution of €3 million, towards the cost of providing broadband services to all primary, voluntary secondary, vocational, community, comprehensive and special needs schools.The Department of Education and Science, assisted by my Department, will shortly begin a competitive tendering process for the procurement of such broadband services to all schools, with a view to awarding contracts in autumn 2004 and beginning the roll-out to schools by end 2004.

I met the board of An Post in October and expressed the importance of the early agreement and implementation of the recovery strategy with specified savings and timescales for delivery. A core element of the strategy is a change management programme, which is subject to discussion and agreement with the relevant trade unions in An Post.Talks on the change management element of the recovery strategy are ongoing with the trade unions in An Post with the exception of one union, the Communications Workers Union, CWU. The final agreement on the plan is obviously contingent on the outcome of these negotiations. I met An Post representatives on 8 October 2003, 29 January 2004 and 4 February 2004 to discuss the financial position facing the company.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	583	As I stated in reply to Question No. 156 on 11 November 2003, the television without frontiers directive regulates the reception and retransmission of television broadcasts from one member state to another. The EU Commission is conducting a review of the directive. Last year the Commission invited submissions from interested parties. In its formal submission to the Commission Ireland suggested the directive should be amended to ensure a broadcasting service originating in one member state but intended primarily for reception in another member state should be subject to the broadcasting standards of the member state at which it is primarily directed. It is reasonable to expect that Irish broadcasting standards should be applied to television channels intended primarily for reception in Ireland. A copy of Ireland's submission is available on my Department's website.In December 2003 the EU Commission published its communication on the future of regulatory audiovisual policy. The communication has indicated a number of areas that merit further consideration and that the Commission will establish focus groups or undertake studies to advance its thinking in these areas. The Commission expects the work of these groups and studies will be undertaken in 2004 and 2005. While it is a matter for the Commission to bring forward proposals to amend the directive, I do not expect such proposals before the second half of 2005. I intend to continue to pursue the question of the regulation of services primarily targeted at Ireland as the review progresses.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The Deputy should be aware that the €2 increase in the licence fee approved by me last year, taken together with the increase in the households that should have licences, should result in RTE licence fee revenue growing at more than the rate of inflation in 2004. The Government decision of December 2002, which provided for a substantial increase in the television licence fee, also introduced a new mechanism for determining the future level of the licence fee. The Government decision provided for an annual adjustment of the television licence fee, using a consumer price index minus X formula where X is determined by an external evaluation of RTE's compliance with its statement of commitments and its change management agenda, to take account of rising costs, but also to reflect RTE's performance on execution of change management and programme commitments. My decision to grant RTE an increase of €2 in the licence fee was informed by the report of an independent evaluation of RTE's performance in 2003, that was undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website. The decision to increase the television licence fee by €2 took account of the findings in that report that RTE had achieved a significant amount in 2003, particularly with respect to delivery of programme output, near achievement of its budget target, and implementation of accountability and transparency measures, and while recognising that many changes had taken place, in RTE, the implementation of its change programme has not been as successful as planned.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I recently announced the establishment of a permanent renewables development group, chaired by the Department, which will provide a forum to share expertise and knowledge on an ongoing basis, and improve co-ordination to ensure the continued development of the renewable sector. The promotion of renewable energy technologies, of which wind energy is the dominant form at this time, is a priority of this Government. As Minister with responsibility for energy policy, my immediate goal is to add 500 megawatts of renewables-based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network by 2005 to deliver the target published in the Green paper on Sustainable Energy. In addition, I have announced that, subject to EU state aids clearance, I will support the building of an additional 218 megawatts of new renewable energy projects.The 500 megawatt target is currently being implemented and will be achieved in the main under contracts offered by me under the fifth and sixth alternative energy requirement competitions. I am confident of securing State aids clearance for the additional 218 megawatts that will be allocated to AER VI projects but I cannot commit to individual projects until the European Commission has finalised its position on the State aids notification.In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources, has commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically, SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology research, development and demonstration.The completion of AER VI will close the current chapter of support for renewable energy technologies. However at the end of last year I published a consultation document, Options for Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets and Programmes. The consultation document and supporting annexes, which examine in detail support mechanisms and renewable energy policies in Ireland as well as in other European countries, were published on my Department's website in December 2003 and the closing date for receipt of submissions is next Friday 27 February 2004.The document will be used to map out a future strategy for green energy in the coming years and follows a commitment I gave after the conclusion of the AER VI competition several months ago. The consultation document looks at key areas in the future, including future renewables policy; future green energy contribution to Ireland's electricity markets; how to overcome barriers to the deployment of renewable energy; and future options for market support mechanisms. Respondents are asked to outline their proposals in detail and to estimate the cost of any support measures that are proposed. After an assessment period, the Department will formulate a new renewable support policy, which it intends to have in place by the end of summer 2004.

At that meeting the Commission gave a preliminary view on the conditions required for launching an investigation but further comprehensive consideration including seeking the detailed views of other member states is necessary.The deadline for submission of those views was Friday last, 20, February 2004. Given the urgency attached to this issue by both Ireland and the UK, I expect the Commission to consider these views and to formally respond to the request shortly. In the meantime, the Commission services have contacted the governments of the third countries who export into the EU market to explore possible alternative solutions to the current situation. Ireland and the UK have both stated that a workable and enforceable solution, arrived at through renewed dialogue, would be preferable to introducing safeguard measures. The matter will be the subject of further discussion at the European Commission's safeguards committee.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	588	There have been a number of recent reports on the potential risk from environmental contaminants, such as dioxins, to the consumer of farmed salmon. Most recently, a paper in the journal Science received media attention. Measures are in place and further steps are being taken to ensure consumers are not exposed to an unacceptable risk from eating farmed salmon.Persistent organic pollutants, of which dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs are examples, are widespread in the environment. Due to measures taken at international level, to which Ireland is a party, levels of dioxins, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides are decreasing in the environment. However, they are still found in fish due to their persistence and due to accumulation in fish tissue.The Marine Institute carries out surveillance monitoring for residues in Irish aquaculture in accordance with Directive 96/23/EC on behalf of the Department. This includes routine surveillance of environmental contaminants, such as trace metals, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides in farmed salmon. Since monitoring commenced in 1999, the levels of these contaminants have been well below available standards in all 485 samples.In 2001, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, with the assistance of the Marine Institute, carried out an investigation into the levels of dioxins and PCBs, including "dioxin-like" PCBs, in farmed salmon and trout and wild salmon. The FSAI concluded that levels of dioxins were well below the EU maximum limits and on average less than 25% of the limit. There are no current EU maximum limits for PCBs in food, but the European Commission is working towards proposals for maximum limits for PCBs and "dioxin-like" PCBs. The FSAI, the Marine Institute and BIM are carrying out another collaborative survey of persistent organic contaminant levels in farmed fish this year. The results of this study will be used to provide an updated assessment of any possible health significance of the levels of these contaminants in Irish farmed salmon. Oily fish play an essential role in a balanced nutritious diet, as they are an important source of omega-3 fatty acids. The FSAI advises that consumers eat one to two portions of fish per week, including one portion of oily fish such as salmon.The EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, David Byrne, has reacted to the recent Science study. He highlights that the study did not raise new food safety issues and that the data was consistent with results from other surveys, but that that did not mean the presence of these contaminants is not a cause for concern. He points to the “comprehensive strategy adopted by the European Commission in 2001 to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment, feed and in food.” The pesticides mentioned in the Science study have long been prohibited in the EU. Commissioner Byrne concluded that “fish, be it farmed or wild, has its place in a well balanced diet to ensure consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects.” Notwithstanding the aquaculture industry has indicated its willingness to review, with relevant State agencies, mechanisms for reducing the level of these contaminants in farmed fish.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I am fully committed to developing a range of sustainable and renewable energy options for Ireland. The renewable fuels standard legislation was passed by the US Senate in June 2003 and was backed by a coalition which included agricultural groups. Among the measures included in this legislation was a target for the use of renewable fuels in refineries.The EU directive on the promotion of the use of bio-fuels or other renewable fuels for transport has a similar provision in that it obliges member states to set targets for the percentage of bio-fuels to be used in transport fuels. Research is being conducted into the potential for bio-fuels in Ireland and a number of pilot projects are already under way. These projects, some of which are supported by Sustainable Energy Ireland, include the growing of rapeseed which can be converted into bio-diesel and then used in transport fuels. New measures have also been included in the 2004 Finance Bill, which will allow excise exemption on pilot projects for bio-fuels. Inevitably, there will be a knock-on effect for farmers, who may grow rapeseed to service the market or for whom this will provide a market for certain farming waste products.I recently established a bio-energy strategy group, comprising representatives of my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, COFORD and various industry representatives. The group is considering the potential for all forms of bio-energy, including energy from agricultural and forestry production and waste. The group will report to me by the end of 2004 with proposals to increase market penetration of these environmentally friendly energy products, which may benefit farmers through production of new products or through creating a market for waste, products which farmers may have traditionally had to pay to dispose of.

One of these draft directions focuses on wholesale and retail telephone line rental, recognising the importance of the single billing product to advancing competition.The direction as drafted, mandates ComReg to introduce by Wednesday 31 March, 2004 a single billing product for voice and data services; to insist that the margin between wholesale and retail is wide enough to drive competition; and to insist that the product is accessible, affordable, and available for telecoms operators; and contains any other conditions required that will give incentive to and drive competition in this market.These directions have been published in draft format for public consultation until Monday 1 March 2004 and I welcome input from both the industry and the public.

No.  307 of 2003, ComReg are conducting a market analysis of the wholesale mobile access and call origination. It is ComReg's preliminary view that Vodafone and O2 have a collectively dominant position. ComReg have published their findings and proposed remedies for consultation.In addition, I have recently published draft policy directions which I propose to give to the Communications Regulator, one of which focuses on competition as a key objective for 2004 and one of which focuses on national roaming.These draft directions will, if issued in final form, mandate ComReg to: implement where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support, in all ways possible, entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players and; use its powers to mandate national roaming on existing GSM networks of incumbent mobile network operators on fair commercial terms subject to relevant requirements under European law.These directions have been published in draft format for public consultation until Monday 1 March 2004 and I welcome input from both the industry and the public.

The operation and management of the fishery harbour centres is by way of the fishery harbour centres fund which is provided for in section 9 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968. All income received by way of harbour dues, rents, etc. are paid into the fund and outlay in respect of the management, staffing, maintenance and so on of the harbours is paid from the fund.For capital investment purposes Dingle is treated as a fishery harbour centre with the Exchequer meeting the full cost of development works.

Such control is a key element in fisheries management policy and enables the sustainable management and development of the fisheries concerned. This is an entirely valid policy objective, and I fully support it.I have met representatives of both fishermen and the fish processing sector on the implementation of these new procedures. These discussions were wide-ranging and comprehensive and focused on the need to ensure that catch quality is maintained.I am pleased that following these constructive discussions, it has proved possible to put in place certain transitional arrangements which are both effective in control terms and satisfy the legitimate requirement of both fishermen and processors to maintain the quality of catches.In the coming period, additional infrastructural facilities, such as weighing facilities, will be installed in the relevant fishery harbour centres to enable an efficient and effective implementation of these new requirements. In addition, I have asked my Department to work with local authorities and industry to ensure that the necessary facilities are also put in place in the key additional ports. In tandem with this process, a close dialogue will be maintained with sectoral representatives to ensure that appropriate account is taken of any practical issues arising.

These were to be four flagship projects in advance of the NDP marine tourism grant scheme which was launched in February 2002.The estimated total cost of the Kenmare projects was €1,665,540 which included provision for a pier with slipway and adjoining buildings on which marine leisure training courses would take place. The grant approved to the Kenmare project of €752,550, 45.2% of estimated total cost, was subject to a number of conditions, including evidence of planning and foreshore permissions having been obtained.Payment of the first instalment of the grant on 3 December 2001 in the amount of €332,312 was made on the basis of invoices in respect of matured liabilities and copies of the planning permission and foreshore lease that had been obtained. Despite transmitting the latter documents in support of the application for payment, the promoters did not draw the Department's attention to any departure from the terms for the planning permission or foreshore lease in their progressing of the construction of the centre up to that point.In October 2002 however, following investigation by the Department's engineers, the Department became aware that the development had not been constructed in line with its planning permission, and the Department's engineering division was immediately asked to investigate the situation with the local authority. As a consequence, no further payments from the grant were made and the Department liaised with Kerry County Council on the planning difficulties.As the promoters had applied for retention permission, it was considered advisable to await the outcome of the planning process before taking legal advice as to how the State's investment should be protected.Following Bord Pleanála's refusal of retention, a new planning application was made to Kerry County Council. This application was withdrawn in November 2003 and steps were taken by Kerry County Council to enforce the conditions of the original planning permission.The Department has sought legal advice, in December 2003, on the status of the moneys paid and the status of the outstanding grant.

It was carried out over the period August 2001 to October 2002 and the final report of the study was completed in March 2003. My Department and the environmental monitoring group, EMG, for the Corrib gas field development were informed of this work.To date a small amount of development work has taken place in the bay in the period to September 2002 and this was done in full consultation with the heritage service of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and with the agreement of my Department. The full results of this recent study will no doubt be used by the company to guide them and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in making further decisions on the processes to be adopted for the installation of the offshore pipeline.The consultation by the company with The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the results of the study is a matter for the developing company.

The process is being underpinned through ongoing consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.BIM and the institute were tasked with drafting anti-pollution programmes for the designated areas, in consultation with relevant local authorities, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this process is substantially complete.In this regard, a formal response, detailing the significant progress already made in this matter, issued to the European Commission on 30 January 2004, in reply to the Commission's inquiry for an update on the situation.

Particular importance is attached to the ethical behaviour of those appointed to positions of director in these bodies. The code contains an appendix setting out a framework code of business conduct for directors and employees.In order to provide for greater transparency I have proposed the introduction of a requirement whereby all those to be appointed or re-appointed to positions of director in the State bodies under the aegis of my Department will be required to produce a valid tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. Existing directors, however, would serve out their terms under the conditions that applied when they were appointed.In addition, I have also proposed the introduction of a provision that all directors of State bodies under the aegis of my Department would sign an annual compliance statement on a personal basis in relation to the code of practice.The Deputy is aware that my Department is not the only one with responsibility for State bodies and in this context the Department of Finance has convened a cross-departmental committee to consider the implications for the wider State body sector should this initiative proceed.The Deputy will appreciate that the question of examining a possible independent appointments system for directors of State bodies is one that would require cross-departmental consideration and is more appropriate a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

The EU Commission will propose an update to the recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity. The Commission intends to publish the update to the recommendation in March. This would provide time for the Commission document to be discussed at meetings of the audio-visual working group in March and April with a view to the updated recommendation being placed on the agenda of the Education and Culture Council in May, for a policy discussion.

I am aware that gas safety is a high priority for BGE.BGE has an ongoing programme to replace all cast iron mains with polyethylene pipe within the next ten years. The network at present consists of 8,000 km of which over 85% or 6,800 km is polyethylene. When BGE took over the networks of the former town gas companies, there were 3,000 km of cast iron mains.Following the Raglan House explosion in the mid 1980s, BGE followed a strategy to replace all cast iron pipes greater than four inches diameter or serving buildings of four or more storeys. This programme was completed well within the scheduled ten years. All other cast iron mains have been subject to replacement in pace with roadworks, building redevelopment and new construction.The report of the independent investigation of the Rathfarnham explosion of 2 November 2003 was published by the CER on 25 November 2003 and the commissioner provided my Department with a copy on that day. Among the recommendations in the report, all of which were accepted by the commissioner, was that BGE should put in place a parallel programme of cast iron mains replacement in areas where the ground was known to be liable to subsidence. In the report, the investigator noted that BGE had already commissioned work to assess the vulnerability of its cast iron network to poor ground conditions.Another of the recommendations was that BGE report its progress in meeting the recommendations, to the CER, within three months. I understand that BGE and the CER are in close touch with each other in this and allied safety matters and that the cast iron pipe replacement programme is under review.As regards advice to gas users and their neighbours, I would remind them that gas, although a clean and efficient fuel, must be treated with care and to follow the gas industry's safety advice: to report all suspected leaks, not to risk sparks or open flames in a suspected area and to ensure that only suitably qualified personnel install and maintain gas appliances. It will be noted that BGE has a strong safety awareness campaign under way at present.

This new system will form part of an overhaul of the vessel registration process generally by the directorate, which will put safety at the centre of the process. It is proposed that recreational craft would fall into two categories for registration purposes, a small craft register or full registration, depending on length, tonnage and speed.Having carried out a preliminary examination, a number of concerns have arisen which need to be addressed. As part of the process of developing the register I have now requested that the directorate undertake a public consultation process to clarify, in more specific terms, the needs and concerns of the different interests involved.The registration system will be introduced initially on a voluntary basis to facilitate the early commencement of the scheme, but it is my intention that the system will, in time, be put on a statutory basis. The consultation process will commence very shortly.

The Department issued a press release outlining the outcome of that meeting. A further meeting to consider the operating company's detailed proposals, expected at the end of this month, will be held on 22 March 2004.An application for a waste permit under the Waste Management Act 1996 was also lodged with North Tipperary County Council in late December 2003 on behalf of the former operating company. The objections to this application, which refers to an experimental proposal for remediation of the tailings pond, are a matter for the local authority.

It is also an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to harass a person by use of a telephone.Anyone who has information on these matters should bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda Síochána for criminal investigation. Such offences are not the responsibility of ComReg.The registration of pre-paid mobile phones is a complex issue. The enforcement and practicalities of implementing such a register would be difficult given the already high level of mobile phone penetration, the high percentage of prepaid phones already in circulation, and the issues surrounding the capturing of and ensuring the accuracy of the required information.My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for policy on the protection of children from the transmission of pornographic images by phones and other media.

My Department participates in the relevant IMO and EU committees that develop new standards and legislation, and our maritime law is continually updated to ensure that all the resulting EU directives and IMO safety conventions and resolutions are fully implemented.Under Irish and international law all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry the appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite international conventions and regulations applicable to ships of their size and type. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections by their flag states and, under the European Union's port state control system, all vessels using Community ports are liable to inspections by any of the EU states they are visiting. The application of port state control ensures that at any given time a large number of ships operating in Community waters has undergone an inspection by an EU port state control authority.The enforcement of all regulations, including checking that the crew is suitably qualified, is carried out by the surveying staff attached to the maritime safety directorate of my Department. They inspect vessels to ensure that they are complying with the safety standards laid down. Surveyors assign priority to foreign registered vessels that have had adverse inspection reports elsewhere or which fall into certain targeted categories. When any such vessels are found to be deficient, they are detained until the deficiencies are rectifiedDuring 2003 my Department's surveyors inspected 430 foreign vessels under the port state control system. Of these, 37 vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions. The surveyors also inspect Irish registered vessels at least annually. Where a vessel is found not to comply then it is issued with a list of deficiencies to be rectified and it will not be permitted to leave port until the deficiencies have been addressed.The international conventions covered by these inspections include the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, the STCW convention. All crew on board a vessel must have proper certification to ensure that they are suitably trained and can adequately and safely discharge the duties of the positions they hold.I believe that the monitoring of ships by regular inspections is proving to be an effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and that the vast majority of vessels operating into and out of Irish ports and waters are complying with international convention requirements.

The MSE will offer open access to the MANs, for example, optical fibre, subducts and co-location space, on a carrier neutral basis. It is envisaged that telecommunications companies will lease capacity on the MANs from the MSE and offer broadband and related services to the public.Notice of my Department's intention to commence a competitive tender process for the engagement of an MSE was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 19 June 2003.Responses received by the tender deadline of 15 August 2003 have been evaluated, and it is anticipated that the MSE procurement process, as outlined in the instructions to tender document which issued on 19 June 2003, will reach conclusion shortly.

The negotiations were difficult and prolonged and included several items of particular interest to Irish fishermen such as the extension of a "days-at-sea" regime as part of a recovery plan for cod stocks. Close liaison was maintained with representatives of the Irish fishing industry throughout the Council and in my view this contributed significantly to the Council's outcome which has been broadly welcomed by the industry.The Commission had proposed a system of "days-at-sea" that would have limited to an unacceptable degree the length of time that fishermen could spend fishing in all of the Irish Sea and a large area off the Donegal coast. I succeeded in negotiating some fundamental changes to the Commission's proposal which will minimise the impact of the scheme on vessels catching little or no cod, especially prawn fishermen. The fishing effort system agreed provides for a range of fishing days, from no restrictions at all to 12 days per month, depending on the type of fishing gear used and the level of cod, sole and plaice catches. I also persuaded the Council to maintain the spring closure for cod fishing in the northern part of the Irish Sea, thus protecting this stock during its most vulnerable period. The Council also progressed a plan for the recovery of the northern hake stock. These plans aim to restore these stocks to safe levels over a number of years. These are important stocks to Irish fishermen and the need for recovery plans is widely accepted.The December Council also dealt with the setting of quotas for 2004. Some quotas were reduced in accordance with scientific advice whilst in other cases it was possible to increase quotas, again because of improvements in the status of particular stocks. Overall, an 8% increase over last year's quotas was achieved which, bearing in mind the need to respond to biological concerns on particular stocks such as cod, sole and plaice, I consider to be a good result for Irish fishermen. Our 2004 quotas includes additional quota available under the Hague Preference system under which Ireland gets additional whitefish quotas at the expense of other member states. This was achieved in the face of opposition from certain other member states.Overall, I believe the outcome of the Council to be a positive one which helps to maintain a balance between the economic needs of the Irish fishing industry and the need to preserve and rebuild key stocks.

It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants, that a post office is closed. Such closures are regarded as temporary pending an application from a suitable person.In order to improve the viability of the post office network, significant extra commercial business has been acquired including bill pay facilities for the ESB and a contract with the AIB under which the banks' customers can access their accounts through the network.I understand that this new business is contributing to enhancing the sustainability of the network.

The review is about the operation of the Agreement. There can be no change in the fundamentals. We are open to considering practical and sensible changes in the workings of the Agreement where the parties consent to such changes.There are, of course, critical issues to be addressed. In the course of my address at Coleraine University on Thursday, 19 February I emphasised that the essence and core of the Agreement is partnership, that a viable partnership in Northern Ireland can only be constructed on the basis of total equality between the prospective partners. There can be no half-way house between violence and democracy. Equally, there can be no comfortable resting place between exclusion and partnership.We must therefore, have definitive closure to paramilitarianism and a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. We must also have commitment to the inclusion of all parties whose electoral mandate gives them a right of participation in the political system.

This is being driven by the implementation committee and will be discussed with the public service unions.Pending clarification of those procedures, my Department has not carried out any survey to ascertain the number of staff who are interested in relocating from Dublin under the decentralisation programme.Where members of staff, on their own initiative, ask to be considered for relocation, this is noted and will be taken into account when the process of formally ascertaining staff interest in relocation commences.So far, 17 members of staff from the clerical officer, staff officer, executive officer, administrative officer and higher executive officer grades have taken the initiative of alerting the Department to their interest in participating in the decentralisation programmes in a wide range of locations in 15 different counties. This number is likely to change significantly when the procedures are clarified.

No. 475 of 1997 sets out the entitlement in respect of a public holiday of an employee who is not a piece employee and who does not work on a day which is a public holiday. Generally, such an employee shall be entitled to be paid a sum that is equal to one-fifth of the sum, including any regular bonus or allowance the amount of which does not vary in relation to the work done by the employee but excluding any pay for overtime, paid in respect of the normal weekly hours last worked by the employee before that public holiday.Regulation 5(2)(b) of the regulations sets out the entitlement in respect of a public holiday of a piece employee who does not work on a day which is a public holiday. In such circumstances, the employee shall generally be entitled to be paid a sum that is equal to one-fifth of the average weekly pay, excluding any pay for overtime, calculated over: (i) the period of 13 weeks ending immediately before that public holiday, or (ii) if no time was worked by the employee during that period, the period of 13 weeks ending on the day on which time was last worked by the employee before that public holiday.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The support of indigenous industry is afforded a high priority in industrial policy and this is reflected in the programmes pursued by the enterprise development agencies of my Department.Enterprise Ireland, which has the lead role in this area, offers a range of supports aimed at assisting Irish indigenous client companies to expand and compete in the international marketplace. The agency delivers a flexible set of solutions tailored to the needs of individual circumstances of Irish enterprises. Each client company is assigned a development adviser who works with the company in assessing its needs and capabilities, formulating an agreed growth plan and in assisting the company access the range of services and resources it needs to execute that plan.Enterprise Ireland provides funding and non-financial supports to client companies across a range of activities structured within the six key interacting elements of a business development model. Key among these are supports in respect of business planning and information, research, development and design, production and operations, marketing and business development, human resource development and finance for growth. The financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland place a strong emphasis on encouraging research and development and improving the competitiveness of existing companies, supporting new company start-ups and growing exports.In May 2003, Enterprise Ireland launched the competitiveness fund, a €10 million fund established to build the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The final call for proposals under the fund closed on 6 February 2004 with more than €7.5 million already committed to Irish firms. Shannon Development, which has responsibility for Irish industry in the Shannon region, operates a number of programmes aimed at established Irish industry and high potential start-up companies. The main focus is on the technological and management ability of client companies and to the ability of these companies to invest in and exploit research and development. In 2003, the Shannon region's technology based start-up sector continued to be buoyant with seven HPSU business proposals approved for assistance, 37 new start-up feasibility proposals supported and venture capital of €2.5 million leveraged for the start-up sector in the region.The year 2003 saw the opening of the €3.8 million Birr Technology Centre, and the commencement of construction at the Information Age Park Ennis to complete the network of five technology locations, which comprise the Shannon development knowledge network. The company is also developing a concept known as e-towns to help stimulate information-related investment and enterprise to smaller population centres. Five locations have been selected and it is expected that the total capital investment in each location will be in the order of €2 million to €3 million.The city and county enterprise boards, CEBs, have primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector and are strongly committed to the support and development of this sector and will continue to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the country. More than 30,000 jobs have been created in indigenous companies supported by the CEBs since their establishment in 1993.

In recent times, competition from emerging economies to attract industry here has increased. Availability of premises is one of the important attractions for foreign direct investment in Ireland. Some 70 acres of serviced industrial lands are available at the IDA Navan Business Park where four client companies are located. IDA Ireland has accelerated the level of itinerary visits to Navan and is hopeful that this will result in additional projects for the park.IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with Meath County Council's new investment marketing manager in promoting the business park's facilities, nationally and internationally, and securing the provision of required infrastructure in the county, particularly telecoms and electricity. There are proposals for three advance office buildings and one advance technology building in the business park at the planning permission stage. Planning permission has been received for the conversion of a former house estate, Athlumney House, Navan, incorporating 29,000 sq. ft. of office space; this redevelopment programme is well advanced.Expansion projects in Navan that are under way include Generali and Europ Assistance, which will provide additional employment of 57 and 50 jobs respectively. A pilot FÁS traineeship scheme has been established in Navan to service insurance administration. In 2004, FÁS has planned for Navan training programmes such as telesales training, return to work programme, computerised accounts/payroll course, beautician and care assistant traineeships.The Meath County Enterprise Board is facilitating micro-enterprises to create jobs and is providing training courses, business advice and mentoring for enterprises in Navan and elsewhere. The board and Enterprise Ireland have supported the development of the Navan enterprise centre, which consists of over 75,000 square feet of enterprise and office space and employs 150 people. The decentralisation programme announced in the budget includes 100 jobs for relocation to Navan and this should provide a further boost to development in the area.

Adult education and training, which was the focus of the task force report on lifelong learning, is provided in a multiplicity of centres funded by the Exchequer, either directly or through intermediary agencies, including universities, institutes of technology, further education colleges, local adult education centres, Youthreach and traveller training centres, FÁS training centres, community training workshops and dedicated sectoral training centres such as agriculture and tourism. Learning opportunities in this area are also available through a wide range of private providers including private third level colleges and commercial training bodies.It is important to recognise that responsibility in this area is shared involving Government, employers and employees. The need to encourage further training and education of those at work is well recognised. Research shows that the level of investment by companies in the development of skills of their employees is somewhat better than the EU average, but significantly below the best-performing countries such as those in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and the UK. Whereas large companies, and especially foreign-owned companies, invest heavily in their employees, indigenous SMEs are relatively low spenders. For Ireland to be successful in the future we must increase investment in the skills of our workforce and ensure that all workers can get the benefit of such investment. Intensifying global competition is leading to changes in the sectors where Ireland can complete effectively, necessitating a continued focus on changing skill needs and keeping in mind the impact of the changing business environment it is vital that firms take greater responsibility for upskilling their employees to give them a competitive advantage.The issues raised in the Deputy's question about employer support, study time allowance and Government or tax relief to promote life long learning were considered in the course of the preparation of the report of the task force on lifelong learning. These issues were more recently addressed in the Irish Labour Market Review 2003, published by FÁS in late 2003. FÁS will carry out a study in this area, in consultation with relevant organisations, in 2004. This study will make a further contribution to our consideration of this issue.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	627	Following the announcement of a decentralisation programme across the civil and public service, a decentralisation implementation committee has been established within my Department to drive the decentralisation process across the Department and its agencies. This committee has had a preliminary discussion on the need for a risk assessment exercise and is convening a specific meeting at an early date to consider in more detail the requirements for both the Department and its agencies.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The Patents Office, an office of my Department, was decentralised to Kilkenny in 1998. There are currently 82 staff employed in 72 posts in the Patents Office in Kilkenny. A total of 63 posts were decentralised in 1998, of which 15 staff were located from within the Department, 43 were transferred from other Departments and five specialist staff were directly recruited to the Patents Office. With regard to people changes required to achieve decentralisation, the best estimate of the Department is that there were an average of 3.5 people changes for every job decentralised.The cost of the decentralisation, which includes fitting out of accommodation and IT requirements, is estimated at €361,000. It has not been possible to quantify the staffing costs associated with the move to Kilkenny given the required training overlap with existing staff for new staff in advance of the move to Kilkenny; the provision of training for staff relocating from the Patents Office to other areas of the Department and the total administrative costs involved in the processing of staffing, organisational and IT issues resulting from the move to Kilkenny. The associated administrative costs would also include the time and effort of staff in personnel units of other Government Departments, staff of the Office of Public Works and the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners who all contributed to the move of the Patents Office to Kilkenny.

A total of 503 staff responded to the survey, 69 of whom indicated that they would be prepared to transfer to Carlow and 160 of whom indicated a willingness to decentralise to other locations outside Dublin. It should be noted that the majority of those who expressed a willingness to decentralise listed a number of possible locations.

It is understood that interest has been expressed in acquiring the facility for non-manufacturing purposes but agreement has not yet been reached.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that CHCI provides a full SAR service to the standard required and demanded by the Irish Coast Guard. This service includes medical evacuation in the Ireland search and rescue region and island relief. As such, I can see no reason for coastal and island communities to be concerned about the standard of emergency service available from CHCI, when they replace the Air Corps in the north west.In addition, one of the roles of the Defence Forces under the white paper on defence is the provision of services to civil authorities as and when required. The Defence Forces have never been found wanting in this regard, particularly in times of floods, forest fires, severe weather conditions or any other emergencies faced by the community, including those on the islands. In the event of an emergency request from the Coast Guard, or, from any other service, the Air Corps will obviously respond to any such request in it usual efficient and supportive manner and to the best of its capability.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	633	There are no full time civil servants in my Department who were political advisers prior to appointment.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	634	No assessment of the type described by the Deputy has been carried out by my Department. Civil-military working groups have been set up to consider the practical aspects of the transfer of staff to Newbridge and the Curragh. In that regard, appropriate measures will be put in place to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the operations of the Department and of Defence Forces headquarters.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	635	The Deputy will be aware that the finance branch of my Department was decentralised to Galway in 1989. Of the 176 staff who relocated, 43 were already serving in my Department while 133 transferred from other Departments. The move to Galway was over-subscribed in terms of applicants from all grades and it was not necessary to recruit locally for administrative posts. Ten staff were recruited in the services and telephonist areas. There were no relocation expenses paid. There are currently 194 people employed in the finance branch of my Department. The Deputy will also be aware that the Directorate of Military Police, Directorate of Reserve Forces and Headquarters 1 Southern Brigade FCA, comprising 23 military personnel in all, decentralised to Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, County Tipperary, in 2001.

The current timber output of 3 million cubic metres is anticipated to grow to 3.95 million cubic metres by 2005 and to 4.44 million cubic metres by 2010. This represents output growth of 37% in a decade.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The person named submitted an application for consideration of force majeure — exceptional circumstances to my Department on 21 January 2004. Processing of applications has commenced and my Department will be in contact with the person named in the coming weeks.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	639	Payment due to the person named under the 2003 area-based compensatory allowance scheme could not be made until a potential stocking density problem had been resolved but, now that this has been done, payment will issue shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	640	Milk quota can only be transferred between family members when the land to which the quota attaches is transferred as provided for under the milk quota regulations. A lease of land with quota is possible between family members. That possibility of a land lease has been raised in discussions between my Department and the named person, but I understand the named person and his brother are reluctant to follow this course. There is no provision under the regulations whereby a producer can temporarily transfer quota without land to another producer.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	641	Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The person named submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship and this was considered by the tribunal in the current 2003-04 milk quota year. Unfortunately, it did not recommend making an allocation on this occasion and the person named was notified of this outcome. While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available and the sizeable number of applications received, to meet the demands for quota from all applicants.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	642	In setting up this group, I was guided by the context and the environment in which the agri-food sector will be operating in the future. The agriculture and food sectors exist in a rapidly changing and internationalised environment. Farmers rely on a series of routes for their output to reach these customers. Equally, the processing sector, whether co-operatives, private or public companies, the distribution networks, the retail sector and catering sectors are all vital links for the farmers with consumers. In addition and to an increasing extent, agriculture has had to take on board many issues including animal welfare, the environment, biodiversity and the enhancement of the landscape. It is with this degree of complexity in mind that I appointed the group. The membership of the group consists of experts drawn from farming, the food industry, research, academia, the State agencies and the business world. This group has a good balance of representation and will, in my view, provide the agri-food sector with the vision and strategies needed for the future.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	643	Payment of the 2004 forestry premiums will begin to be made towards the end of March as has been the position over the years.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming and its successor introduced in November 2000 are both governed by EU Council regulations. It is a requirement of these regulations that the early retirement pension may only be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension payable. This means that any national retirement pension payable to a participant in the scheme must be deducted from his or her early retirement pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. The overpayment for the person named arose from the concurrent payment of her husband's old age contributory pension and the full amount of early retirement pension. My Department is obliged to recover all overpayments under the scheme, as failure to do so would jeopardise its obligations with regard to EU funds. However, my Department will consider sympathetically any proposals the person named may wish to make to repay the full amount over a period of time.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The person named applied on 118 ewes under the 2003 ewe premium scheme, which he declared to be in his ownership and possession at the time of application on 6 January 2003 and which he undertook to keep on his holding up to 13 April 2003. At an inspection of his flock on 17 December 2003 only 84 ewes were presented. The person named was unable to account for the 34 missing ewes. He was given the opportunity to submit sales dockets to prove that he disposed of the 34 ewes after the retention period but he failed to do so. As the person named failed to satisfy my Department that he had 118 ewes when he applied in early 2003, and since he could not account for the movements of 34 of those 118 ewes, he cannot be paid 2003 ewe premium according to the relevant EU regulations.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The position is that on one occasion in 2002 and on three occasions in 2003, my Department raised the issues of extension and reclassification of Ireland's disadvantaged areas at meetings with the EU Commission. On all four occasions the Commission services strongly made the point that a review request for designation or reclassification of any area could lead to a demand for justification of the current designation and classification of all Ireland's existing disadvantaged areas.On the most recent occasion when my Department's officials endeavoured to progress this matter, at a meeting with the Commission on 9 December last, they were advised again by the Commission to be well aware of the risk associated with an examination of any formal request for designation or reclassification. In the light of the Commission's attitude, which has its basis in negative comments by the Court of Auditors, my Department is examining at present how best it can progress this matter further.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	647	The person named is in receipt of the maximum annual payment under the current early retirement scheme. There are no additional allowances payable under the scheme in respect of adult or other dependents. Because the person named joined the scheme under the joint management arrangement, the value of her husband's old age contributory pension must be deducted from her early retirement pension. If he receives an adult dependent allowance, this amount must also be deducted from the early retirement pension. The question of eligibility for the adult dependent allowance, as an addition to the old age contributory pension, is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	648	There are no full-time civil servants in my Department who first entered the service as political advisers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I understand an application was received in my Department from the named person for a certificate of entitlement to transfer milk quota. This application sought to assign the entire transferable element of the milk quota on the sale by him of a part of his lands. Milk quota attaches equally to all the lands used in the dairying enterprise in the reference year. When part of a holding is to be sold it is essential that the Department is assured as to what parts of the holding were dairying lands in the reference year so that the amount of quota attaching to the lands in sale can be calculated for the purpose of the certificate.In view of the information provided to date on the use of the other lands owned during the reference year, my Department wrote to the applicant proposing that a proportionate amount of the quota, rather than the entire quota, would be attached to the lands in sale and seeking observations in the matter. No reply has yet been received from the applicant but the matter will be fully considered on receipt of such a reply.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	650	An application from the person in question for grant aid under the native woodland scheme is currently being processed by my Department. A decision on the application will be given as quickly as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	651	This matter is the subject of an appeal. The agriculture appeals office received the appeal from this herd owner on 6 February 2004. Appeals receive individual examination and are dealt with in the order in which they are received. The appeals office will contact the appellant shortly to arrange the oral hearing he requested. It is not expected that there will be any undue delay in dealing with this case.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	652	Payment of the 2004 forestry premium will begin to be made toward the end of March as has been the position over the years.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The single payment scheme will commence on 1 January 2005 and all livestock premia and arable aid schemes will cease to exist as and from 31 December 2004. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the single decoupled payment will be based on the average number of animals or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals and arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Entitlements are calculated by dividing this single payment amount by the average number of hectares over the three-year period. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year. In general, farmers must also have an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement.The coupled dairy premium will be introduced this year. It will be based on the milk quota held — owned and leased in — on 31 March 2004. The applicant must be a milk producer as the premium is linked to production. The dairy premium will be decoupled from production in 2005 and will be based on the milk quota held — owned and leased in — on 31 March 2005. Dairy premium entitlements are calculated by dividing the premium by the average number of hectares over the three-year period where a farmer has existing livestock and arable entitlements or by the eligible hectares owned in 2005 where the farmer has no existing entitlements. In cases where livestock and arable entitlements are already established and the farmers concerned qualify for the decoupled dairy premium, the value per hectare of the decoupled dairy premium is added to the value of the existing livestock entitlements without the necessity of having additional eligible hectares.If the person named sells his cows and milk quota after 31 March 2004, he will qualify for the coupled dairy premium in 2004 if he was an active milk producer in the 2003-04 milk marketing year. He will also have livestock entitlements established for 2005 based on the average number of animals that qualified for payment under the various livestock premia schemes during the three year reference period. I assume that when the Deputy refers to selling premia rights, he means selling livestock entitlements under the new regime. Under European Council Regulation 1782/03, the person named may sell some of his entitlements without land after he has activated at least 80% of his entitlements in any one calendar year.The position with regard to rented land is that negotiations on the detailed rules regulation governing the implementation of the single payment scheme including the issue of land availability are ongoing between the European Commission and all member states. The Commission is expecting to have agreement on the detailed rules by the end of March 2004. It is not possible therefore, to indicate at this stage what the position will be in relation to the person named.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	654	The person named applied for premium for 60 animals under the 2003 suckler cow scheme for small scale milk suppliers. He applied under his Tipperary herd number but was a milk supplier under his Galway herd number Under the terms and conditions of the scheme an applicant must have a milk quota which does not exceed 39,594 gallons on 31 March 2003 to 1 April 2003. Our records show that the person named held a milk quota of 40,471 gallons at 31 March 2003 and as a result is not entitled to payment under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	655	Officials of my Department visited Pullathomas and had a useful discussion with the farmers affected.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	656	As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the single decoupled payment will be based on the average number of animals — or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid — on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals and arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Entitlements are calculated by dividing this single payment amount by the average number of hectares over the three-year period. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year.Since the person named had no animals that attracted payment under the suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes during the three year reference period, he will not have any entitlements established in respect of those schemes. However, he will have entitlements established based on the average number of animals that qualified for payment in the reference period under the slaughter premium and special beef premium schemes.While the European Commission's detailed rules regulations on decoupling have not yet been agreed, my Department has commenced the work of establishing entitlements for every farmer in the country. My Department intends to establish interim single payment entitlements for each farmer and to notify those entitlements to individual farmers during 2004. Definitive details will issue early in 2005. It will not be possible, however, to finalise this work until such time as the Commission's detailed rules are fully agreed. This will be well into spring of this year.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The decentralisation plans announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement will necessitate the movement of at least 470 of my Department's staff and 185 staff in Teagasc, Bord Bia and Bord Glas. This will require careful planning and organisation to minimise disruption to the work of my Department and of the other agencies. The central decentralisation implementation group is drawing up an overall implementation plan which is to be submitted by March 2004. My Department's own decentralisation implementation group will examine the plan and organise detailed internal implementation arrangements. My Department will also monitor the arrangements being put in place by the agencies.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	658	Table 1 shows the existing staff of my Department's decentralised headquarters offices in Johnstown Castle, Castlebar, Cavan and Portlaoise. The table also shows the years in which the original decentralisation to these locations took place. Table 2 shows the previous career history of the staff involved in the most recent decentralisation to Johnstown Castle — other than forest service staff — along the lines requested by the Deputy. My Department cannot provide total numbers of job and people changes to achieve the decentralisation as many of these changes would have occurred in other Departments. My Department has not carried out a detailed examination of the pattern in the other offices listed in table 1 because of the time elapsed and the detailed work involved.The cost of the building in each case was borne by the Vote of the Office of Public Works. The cost of furniture, carpets, blinds and miscellaneous items were a charge on this Department and the estimated cost for all four offices listed is in the region of €3 million. I should also add that my Department has 1,700 staff based in local offices in different parts of the country.Staff currently in Decentralised HQ Offices:1970’s1980’sEarly 1990’sLate 1990’sGradeCastlebarCavanPortlaoiseJohnstown CastlePrincipal Officer2104Senior Inspector0001Sen.

In Sustaining Progress, the Government stated that recognising the importance of the nitrates directive and its impact on certain farmers, a number of initiatives shall be taken in the context of optimising the use of available EU and national budgetary resources. These initiatives included a review of REPS with higher payment rates and changes to the terms and conditions of the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme with an increase of the income and eligible investment ceilings. Proposals for REPS, including an average 28% increase in payments, are now with the European Commission for approval.Earlier this year, I secured approval from the EU to proceed with substantial improvements to both the farm waste management and the dairy hygiene schemes with effect from January 2004. The new schemes incorporate a number of major changes. The ceiling for eligibility under the schemes has been raised from 200 to 450 income units. This change will mean that the vast majority of Irish farmers will now be able to avail of grant aid. The investment ceilings have also been raised from €50,790 to €75,000 in the case of farm waste management works and from €31,743 to €50,000 in the case of dairy hygiene works. Furthermore, a standardised grant rate of 40% will now apply for most investments which is twice what would have been available to many farmers previously. In addition, increases have already been applied to the standard costs used to calculate grant aid.Section 21 of the Finance Bill 2004 extends the special scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the construction of facilities to control farm pollution to 31 December 2006, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation in the Finance Act 2004. The scheme allows total expenditure on or after 6 April 2000 on necessary measures for farm pollution control to be written off as a tax allowance over seven years. This allowance is subject to a maximum write-off in any one year of the lesser of 50 % of the expenditure or €31,743.

All interested parties were invited to provide comments in writing within two months. I have received a submission on the draft nitrates action programme from the Irish Farmers' Association. The issues raised in the submission will be considered by the two Departments, in association with all submissions by other interested parties, in the preparation of the final proposals.I will give consideration to the issues involved in consultation with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government having regard to the need to finalise the terms of the action programme at an early date and submit definitive proposals to the EU Commission.

The draft nitrates action programme currently under discussion includes a provision to this effect and is consistent with the provisions of Sustaining Progress.

According to the records in my Department, there was no medical evidence supplied by the person named with his application for additional suckler cow quota or to the local office of my Department with his suckler cow premium application. Furthermore, when an official from my Department contacted him on 19 December 2003 concerning the allocation of an additional six quota rights to the four he had already received, the person named did not mention any medical condition and indicated that the total allocation of ten quota rights from the 2004 national reserve would suffice. In any event, his medical history is not relevant to the criteria for allocating quota rights from the 2004 reserve.As previously indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 29 January 2004, if the person named has more than 14 eligible animals, for which he has quota, on which he wishes to claim suckler cow premium under the 2004 scheme, he may purchase or lease in additional quota in order to qualify for payment on all his eligible animals. However, it will be essential to lodge an area aid application in 2004 if the person named wants to qualify for payment in excess of 15 livestock units.

Aid can take a variety of forms including grants, interest relief and tax relief. The issue as to whether or not aid granted by member states in any particular case is compatible with the state aid articles of the treaty is a matter for the European Commission.The European Commission was informed of the existence of the tax exemption for stallion stud fees in line with the applicable state aid procedures in June 1982 and on a further number of occasions since then.

The Civil Service policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, A Positive Working Environment, was introduced in July 2000 following an agreement between management and the Civil Service staff unions at General Council. The policy is based on best practice in this area and meets the standards set out in the code of practice provided by the Health and Safety Authority. The policy applies to all persons employed directly by Government Departments and to persons employed by bodies under the aegis of Government Departments.It is the responsibility of public service organisations to develop their own policies in this regard. Figures available to December 2003 indicate that Departments have received approximately 165 complaints under the policy. Of these, 109 complaints were the subject of formal investigations under the policy.The management of claims under the policy is a matter for each Department and Office. The policy is reviewed and monitored by my Department, in consultation with personnel officers and staff unions. As part of this process an informal review of the policy is almost complete. The conclusions of the review and any agreed recommendations arising from it will inform the development of the policy into the future.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I indicated in my most recent budget speech that my intention is to bring forward proposals to change certain pension terms for existing staff. These proposals include, in particular, provisions to amend the formula used for integrating public service and social welfare pensions in order to make better provisions for current and future staff on lower pay levels.Integration is the arrangement whereby, in the case of public service employees on full PRSI, which includes unestablished civil servants in the Department of Defence, the social welfare pension is combined with the occupational pension to provide a combined pension which is at least as good as the pension which would have been payable if the sole source of pension were occupational pension alone. For information, the lump sum payment due at the time of retirement is not integrated and as such is payable in full based pensionable remuneration and service.Under the current approach to integration of pensions, the occupational portion of pensions is calculated on the basis of "net pensionable remuneration" — that is, pensionable remuneration less an offset of twice the value of the old age contributory pension. The occupational portion of pension is then calculated at a rate of 1/80th of the net pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum or 40/80th over 40 years. The current approach can provide a very low, or even zero, rate of occupational pension, apart from lump sum, for public servants who retire on low levels of pay.In the approach recommended by the commission on public service pensions and discussed with the public service unions a new formula would be used which would ensure that workers with lower levels of income, that is income below three 1/3rd times old age contribution pension — currently about € 557 per week or €29,100 per annum, would be guaranteed a certain level of occupational income as well at the full old age contribution pension. The occupational portion of the pension will be calculated at 1/200th of total pensionable remuneration for each reckonable year of service; and would be payable in addition to old age contributory pension, as well as the unintegrated lump sum. In the case of employees earning over the limit of three 1/3rd times old age contributory pension, the calculation would yield the same pension as heretofore.The effect of these proposed changes would be to improve the rate of occupational pension for lower paid public service workers generally, including relevant Department of Defence employees, while not affecting the occupational pensions of workers who are on relatively higher pay. It is important to note that old age contributory pension is paid in addition to the occupational pension, in respect of these workers, and would not be affected by the proposals. Similarly the unintegrated lump sum payments are not affected.The revised proposals are in line with recommendations brought forward by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and improved, since then, in line with discussions with trade union representatives.

The employees pay part of the cost. The difference between the cost to the employer and the amount paid by the employees is a taxable benefit which must be apportioned between the employees concerned based on the facts including the number of children involved for each employee. The apportionment should lead to a result which is fair and reasonable.Revenue have advised me that they will be in contact with the employer to ensure that there is an appropriate tax treatment in this case.

It was decided not to conduct a survey of the staff of the Department on decentralisation as, until the implementation plan is completed, they will not have the information they need to assist them in making an informed decision on the matter. When the implementation plan is completed research will be commenced among Department staff as to their interest in decentralising to Tullamore and other locations.A number of expressions of interest have been received from staff of my Department and from other Departments, in relation to decentralisation and those have been noted, but will not be processed further pending receipt of the implementation plan.

Since then my Department has received numerous representations, submissions and advices on the programme. In the context of budget 2004, taking account of these, the Government decided to decentralise over 10,000 civil and public servants.We are now in the implementation stage and I have established an implementation committee to drive this forward. I am awaiting the report of the committee which I expect to receive by the end of March. Following this each Department will be required to develop a detailed plan for its own element of the programme. I have no doubt that the question of risk assessment and risk mitigation, covering such aspects as business continuity, financial and logistical issues will be addressed in the detailed planning exercise.

No further works are planned. This work was carried out by OPW as an agent of the county council.On the issue of flooding at Ardclough, Kildare County Council agreed that insufficient information is available to address the flooding problem. Further technical and engineering data is required. The county council agreed to consider how this information might be gathered.Flooding problems in the areas mentioned are a matter for the local authority in the first instance. OPW is happy to assist with technical advice and guidance but I must point out that no flood relief scheme is planned for any of these locations. The flood policy review which I initiated in November 2002 has now completed its work and the report of the review group will shortly be submitted to Government. I hope to be in a position to publish the report in the very near future. As well as setting out a strategy for flood management in the future, the report will clarify responsibilities of central and local government and set out criteria for prioritisation of resources on flood management measures.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	679	In March 2002, the Dalai Lama wrote to the Foreign Ministers of EU member states, asking that an EU special representative for Tibet be appointed. In a joint response at that time, and after careful consideration, the EU Ministers were unanimously of the view that nominating an EU special representative would not contribute positively to the situation. The response also made clear the long-standing concern of the Union about the human rights situation in Tibet.The position was considered again by member states at the end of last year and it was agreed that the position had not changed. The Union emphasised that it would make full use of the EU-China human rights dialogue, and other avenues, to convey its concerns, and that it would also continue to encourage direct talks between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities.Following the decision of the European Council in December 2003 that the embargo on the sale of arms to China should be re-examined, I held initial discussions on this matter with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, on 26 January 2004. The matter has now reverted to the preparatory bodies of the Council for further consideration of the facts and issues which surround this difficult and complex matter. The GAERC will further discuss this question when this preparatory work has been completed. The GAERC will review this issue in the context of the EU's commitment to human rights and our overall relationship with China, as well as the broader regional and international context. A decision would follow only on a full and detailed consideration, and would require consensus among EU partners.

This will involve the relocation to Limerick of some 130 posts. Departmental staff are also expected to apply to decentralise to some of the other 52 centres.The Deputy will be aware that, in addition to a passport office in Cork and a new passport facility being established in Balbriggan, this Department also has 67 resident diplomatic and consular missions abroad, with which Dublin-based staff liaise on a daily basis, by e-mail, fax, telephone and video conference facility. The decision to relocate the Development Co-operation Directorate to Limerick does not, therefore, pose any exceptional problem for the efficient and effective operation of the Department in general, or the directorate itself in particular.The decentralisation programme poses certain challenges for the Department. I am confident that, with careful planning, these challenges will be met. Measures to minimise potential risks to efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in the period leading up to, during and following the decentralisation to Limerick, will be planned and overseen by the Department's recently established decentralisation committee.

Two of the original three posts were filled from within the Department. The third officer came from another Department. The staffing complement of the office has increased in the intervening years, as a consequence of its upgrade to full passport-issuing status with responsibility for processing all applications from the Munster area, and in line with significant annual increases in passport demand since 1987. The office's current staff complement is 56 posts.The Office of Public Works is responsible for the provision of office accommodation. No significant costs arose for the Department of Foreign Affairs in connection with the establishment of the office in Cork. The Deputy will be aware of my announcement a year ago of plans to open a new passport production facility in Balbriggan during 2004. This will involve the relocation of some 80-90 posts initially, approximately one third of which are expected to be filled by staff recruited from other Government Departments and offices.

In particular, the timing of moves will be a central issue. In this context we would wish to be in a position to give staff as much information as possible prior to asking them to indicate whether they wish to decentralise. The content of the central implementation plan report, to be prepared by the implementation committee for the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation by the end of March, will be of particular relevance in this regard. I anticipate that the Department of Foreign Affairs will conduct a decentralisation survey shortly after the presentation of that report.

Section 35 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a stipulation that for children who were detained in institutions, other than children who were detained as a result of an offence, should not be regarded as having any form of conviction. In the case where children were detained in an institution as a result of an offence the Children Act 2001 provides that the offence committed by a minor shall be sealed after a period of three years.I have made arrangements for an extract of the Children Act 2001, which outlines the conditions for non-disclosure of certain finding of guilt for offences committed by a minor, to be forwarded to the Deputy.

I can confirm, also, that my Department has received applications for special educational resources, SER, from the school referred to by the Deputy, including an application for the pupil in question.SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August, 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year. The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September, 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.

In October 2000, my Department introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme for schools to provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or for the purchase of resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for the current year.In 2002, primary schools designated as disadvantaged schools received a grant of €1,270 while other recognised primary schools received a grant of €635. Approximately €2.4 million was allocated to schools in 2002 under this scheme. In the light of the current budgetary constraints, I decided to withdraw payment of the grant from 2003. However, schools may use their ordinary capitation grant which has been increased to €121.58 with effect from 1 January 2004. The position will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	689	As the Deputy may be aware, 2004 is designated as the European Year of Education Through Sport, EYES, the official launch of which was successfully held in Dublin in January. To coincide with EYES, my Department's published 2004 schools building programme includes provisions for a number of physical education halls at post-primary level to proceed to tender and construction in the current year.These sports facilities are to be delivered under two programmes, the dual use PE halls under the drugs task force initiative, and the generically-designed halls, which will provide the template for future sports facilities in schools nationwide. Both programmes will be evaluated on an ongoing basis throughout the construction phase, and in relation to the generically-designed halls in particular, this will inform any decision to extend the scheme to those post-primary schools requiring new or refurbished indoor sporting facilities. Progression of the sports hall project at the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in this regard and in the context of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I am aware that the universities will be challenged in the short term by the constraints on recurrent Exchequer funding placed on them in 2004, having regard to overall cost pressures. I appreciate that individual institutions are required to find economies and to become more streamlined in some of their operations in order to reconcile available budgets with pre-existing demands and commitments. This must be viewed, however, in the context of overall increases in investment in higher education over recent years and the Government's longer term strategic objective for excellence in the sector.In 2004, overall investment in higher education under my Department's vote stands at some €1.48 billion. This is an increase of approximately 74% since 1997. Ireland's spend on higher education as a percentage of GDP in 2000 ranked us eighth out of 29 OECD countries looked at. If GNP, as opposed to GDP, is used as the comparator for Ireland, we would be placed among the top ranking OECD countries on this measure.The Government has identified the placement of our higher education system at the top rank of the OECD in terms of quality and levels of participation as a key national strategic issue and we are continuing to work towards that. In this context, I have asked the OECD to conduct a wide-ranging review of higher education in Ireland and this is currently underway. The objective of this review is to lay down a strategy for future excellence for higher education in Ireland in the context of the intensely competitive global environment in which we now operate. Moving forward, we need to measure ourselves against the best systems worldwide if we want to build on the strong foundations for success that we already enjoy here in Ireland. The OECD review will provide us with that international reference point and will consider all of the issues and challenges associated with achieving those goals.With regard to the various student supports measures, in addition to the ordinary maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, my Department has responsibility for promoting access and participation opportunities for students in higher education. Under the social inclusion measures in the national development plan, there was provision for a third level access fund totalling €121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by three target groups: students from disadvantaged backgrounds; mature students; and students with disabilities. Since 1997, spending on third level access measures funded directly by the Department of Education and Science has been increased from €0.5 million to €26 million in 2003. By any standards this represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources. The Deputy will also be aware that last May I announced a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grants for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged.I believe that this substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.

When publishing the 2004 school building programme, I outlined that my strategy going forward will be grounded in capital investment based on multiannual allocations. My officials are reviewing all projects which were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including them as part of a multiannual school building programme from 2005 and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements on this matter in the course of the year. The project for St. Mary's school, Aghamore, will be considered in this regard.

This proposed project is at stage 4/5 (detail design/bill of quantities) of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.Indicative timescales have been included for large-scale projects proceeding to tender in 2004. The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multiannual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme including Bonniconlon national school. I will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.

Following completion of this assessment contact will be made directly with the school authorities.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	695	Officials of the planning and building unit of my Department met recently with the trustees of St Joseph's secondary school, Charlestown, to discuss accommodation issues. In regard to the prefabricated buildings at the school, the position is that the Office of Public Works which has responsibility for the national asbestos programme of detection and remediation in schools is in the process of replacing prefabs at the school and it is expected that these works will be completed over the summer.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	696	I would like to assure the Deputy that a measured approach will be taken to considering the future of the three CABAS facilities in Dublin, Cork and Drogheda. In that regard, my intention will be to ensure continuity of provision for the pupils in question. The concerns of parents for greater certainty are well appreciated and, in this connection, I wish to confirm that my Department is prepared to continue to provide funding for the three CABAS facilities for the next school year, 2004-05.My Department will in due course consider the reports of the inspectorate on autism-specific provisions and any issues arising therefrom will be raised directly with the relevant managements. The position regarding the future of the CABAS facilities beyond 2004-05 will be considered in the context of this process.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I understand that the Deputy is referring to a letter from a member of the School Chaplains' Association concerning funding for in-career development courses. In addition to funding a number of national support services, for example in the areas of curricular reform and special needs, my Department supports a wide range of continuing professional development programmes provided by a network of education centres at local level for personnel working in primary and post-primary schools. In this regard the in-career development unit of my Department funds 21 full-time education centres and nine part-time centres to deliver this service.In the past the unit also provided limited financial support to a range of other course providers/organisers for other elective programmes of inservice, to the extent that resources permitted having regard to other commitments and priorities. This included direct support to the School Chaplain's Association and to schools which applied to my Department rather than to their local education centre.In order to rationalise matters and to make the best use of available resources, direct support to schools and other bodies and groups is no longer being made by my Department. Schools and others are advised to contact their local education centre, whose role it is to provide local inservice and to provide support, advice and assistance to schools and their personnel in these matters. This approach will help avoid duplication and make the best use of available resources.

I can confirm, also, that my Department has received an application for special educational resources, SER, in respect of the child referred to by the Deputy. However, the application is incomplete and the school authorities have indicated that they are submitting the relevant documentation. The application can be considered further following receipt of this documentation.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I propose to take Questions Nos. 276, 278, 279 and 280 together.An application for additional accommodation has been received from the school authority in question. It is currently being assessed in the school planning section of my Department. The school authority will be informed of the outcome.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	700	St. Stephen's primary school, Johnstown, Navan, County Meath, opened with provisional recognition in September 2003. Newly established schools are required to undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide suitable accommodation. This accommodation should be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.My Department has not received any application to date from the school authorities for permanent recognition.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I am most anxious that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive education appropriate to their needs. There are seven facilities in the State operating on a pilot project basis and using alternative educational methods for teaching children on the autistic spectrum. Three of the seven are CABAS facilities, whose teaching method involves a comprehensive application of behaviour analysis to schooling approach.A decision regarding the retention of these establishments will be made in light of an evaluation of provision for children with an autistic spectrum disorder carried out by my Department's inspectorate. It is envisaged that the outcome of the evaluation will be determined and a decision taken on the future of the facilities during the course of the current school year.My Department is actively considering applications from CABAS, Dublin, for autistic provision in south County Dublin. My officials are liaising with my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in this regard. A response will issue to the applicants as quickly as possible.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I am aware that an application for special educational resources, SER, was received from St. Fiachra's senior school in respect of the pupil in question on 21 November 2003. SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school. It also draws attention to a recommendation of the task force on dyslexia that a staged approach should be used in the case of pupils with dyslexia, outlining the stages involved. The expertise within the learning support teacher service is particularly appropriate to the needs of pupils with dyslexia. The school currently has the services of two learning support teachers. Accordingly, my Department has no objection to the needs of the pupil being met from within the school's existing resources.The arrangements for processing applications received after 31 August 2003, including the one referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.

I have therefore arranged for the detailed expenditure figures on an individual school basis for each of the three years to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.It should be noted that all primary schools have received an allocation, under the grant scheme for works grant — also known as the devolved grant — of €3,809.21 per school and €12.70 per pupil in respect of each academic year from 2000-01 to 2003-04. Nationally this annual amount is approximately €18 million. This is not included in the expenditure table above.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Letterkenny Institute of Technology sought approval last year to provide a national certificate in traditional Irish music performance in Falcarragh. I understand that this course has been provided in Falcarragh, as a higher national diploma — UK accreditation, by a subsidiary of Udarás na Gaeltachta. The institute's proposal involves reaccreditation of the course by HETAC and its continued provision in Falcarragh by the institute on an out-centre basis.There are questions as to the appropriateness of providing this type of course within the technological sector of higher education and the institute was informed that it would not be approved pending a review of the remit of the technological sector. The need for such a review arose from a number of course proposals submitted by institutes of technology which appeared to fall outside the range of courses traditionally provided by the technological sector. As any expansion of the range of provision by the technological sector would have significant implications not only for that sector but for third level provision generally, it was decided not to approve any such applications pending a review of the remit of the sector.In this regard, I have asked the OECD to conduct a wide-ranging review of third level education provision and a team of experts is currently engaged in this exercise. I expect to receive a report of the findings of the OECD team later this year. The position in relation to the course in question will be re-examined when the OECD report has been fully considered.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 299 together.There are two primary schools serving St. Mary's parish in Drogheda, County Louth, namely, Scoil Mhuire Fatima NS and St. Mary's boys school. Both schools have submitted applications for major capital grant aid. These applications were examined in the school planning section of my Department in the context of overall primary education requirements in the parish.Having considered all the relevant factors, the conclusion of my Department is that primary provision in the parish can be best served into the future by the provision of two new co-educational schools, one catering for junior cycle pupils and the other catering for senior cycle pupils. I understand that there is a site available in the ownership of the parish which could accommodate this development.On being informed of my Department's decision, the respective boards of management have been asked to engage in a process with the local education partners to facilitate the re-structuring of the schools. Officials in the school planning section of my Department are available to assist the boards in this regard if necessary. When this process has been completed, arrangements will be made to provide the required supporting educational infrastructure as quickly as possible.The school planning section of my Department is not currently actively pursuing the amalgamation of any schools in County Louth. However, as I recently announced, over the remainder of this school year a new school planning model involving published area development plans will be piloted in five areas. Included in the pilot scheme is the north Dublin-south Louth region which covers the Drogheda area.The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Following the consultation process, individual plans will set out the blueprint for schools development in an area covering a period of up to ten years.

These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. The catchment boundaries were determined following consultation with local educational interests and the intention was that certain primary schools would feed exclusively into each centre. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres.The revision of catchment areas is addressed by my Department as the need arises. It is the practice in my Department to consult with local educational interests where any such adjustments are being contemplated. At present, my Department is not changing school catchment areas for the secondary school referred to by the Deputy. However, my Department will continue to monitor the provision of school transport under the terms of the school transport scheme.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	722	At present, there are six psychologists from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, deployed in the north western region, of whom 2.5 psychologists — whole time equivalent — are assigned to County Donegal. The NEPS development plan envisages that there should ultimately be seven educational psychologists in the county. At present, NEPS provides a service to approximately 55% of all school pupils in County Donegal but unfortunately is not yet in a position to provide a service in Inishowen.The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has created a panel of educational psychologists qualified to serve in NEPS. My Department is currently making offers of employment to five psychologists from this panel. The north-western region has been identified as one of the priority regions for assignment of these psychologists. Due to general staffing constraints, it is unlikely that there will be any further recruitment to NEPS during the current school year.At present, schools that do not yet have a service from NEPS may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Details of this scheme have been circulated to all schools and are also published on my Department's website.

Under the terms of the schemes, grants are not available in respect of tuition fees paid at undergraduate level outside of the State. However, all EU students, including students from this State, may be eligible for grant assistance towards the cost of tuition fees from the relevant UK authorities, subject to the same conditions as apply to students who have been resident in the UK. My Department has no plans at present with regard to the introduction of a student loan scheme.Tax-relief has been available for tuition fees paid for full-time, qualifying undergraduate courses in publicly-funded universities or similar third level colleges in any EU member state, including the UK, since 1999/2000.

This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law and was not related to financial considerations.I understand that a meeting of the executive committee of ITE on 5 December agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. I understand from the liquidator that he has extended the period of notice of redundancy for the staff to 27 February 2004. Officials from my Department met with all members of staff of ITE in December, 2003. At the request of SIPTU, a further meeting was held on 28 January, 2004 with that union and its staff representatives.My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and is working closely with the liquidator in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate re-deployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.Options that may be available in this context continue to be explored by my Department. In this regard staff will be kept appraised as developments occur. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate re-deployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts. I have asked to be kept informed of progress in these matters. The level of funding provided to the institute over the last ten years is as follows: 
1995,
€1.159 million; 
1996, 
€1.207 million; 
1997,

This project is at early stages of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.The budget announcement regarding multiannual capital envelopes will enable me to adopt a multiannual framework for the school building programme, which in turn will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme. I will make a further announcements in that regard during the year.

As rationalisation talks with the trustees of the school were ongoing at that time and consistent with standard policy, the application for funding was not approved pending the outcome of the rationalisation negotiations.Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its time-table and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.The rules for allocating teacher resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meets its commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional support i.e. curricular concessions, additional allocation for special needs, additional allocation for traveller and non national pupils.In the last five years the school in question has received additional allocations as follows: 1999/00, 1.36 wholetime teacher equivalent; 2000/01, 
1.36 wholetime teacher equivalent; 
2001/02, 
1.67 wholetime teacher equivalent; 
2002/03, 
1.97 wholetime teacher equivalent; 
2003/04, 
3.17 wholetime teacher equivalent.

The project is awaiting the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning.As I announced in the 2004 school building programme, a key strategy going forward will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multiannual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards.

The further decentralisation of Dublin-based staff will allow management to oversee the consolidation of services and minimise the impact of the proposed move on the diverse services provided to the education sector. The Department is carrying out a risk analysis which should be available by the end of March 2004.

There are currently 335 and 195 staff working in my Department's offices in Athlone and Tullamore, respectively, with a further 175 posts in the State Examinations Commission in Athlone.For each of the phases of decentralisation to Athlone and Tullamore, applications were initially invited from staff already working in the Department, then from those working in the wider Civil Service. Where a shortfall in staff arose, staff were recruited to these vacancies. Since each phase of decentralisation, there has been significant turnover of staff due, for example, to promotions, resignations and retirements. The resultant vacancies have been filled by internal inter-departmental promotion competitions or by lateral transfer.Details of the costings have been requested from the Office of Public Works and I will arrange for these to be forwarded to the Deputy, as soon as they become available.

Special educational resource, SER, applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003, are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's Inspectorate and the national educational psychological service, NEPS. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year or so. Account is also being taken of the data submitted by schools as part of the recent nationwide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school.The arrangements for processing applications received after 31 August 2003 will be considered in the context of the outcome of discussions on a weighted system of allocation of resource teaching support. A further communication will be sent to schools in this regard.

The payment of special needs assistants employed in secondary schools and community and comprehensive schools is a matter for the managerial authority of each school.The issue of my Department providing a payroll service for the employment of special needs assistants in secondary and community and comprehensive schools is under consideration. Special needs assistant posts are allocated by my Department where the professionally assessed needs of a child or children involved are such as to require the delivery of such support. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service. Special needs assistants posts, including the post to which the Deputy refers, are sanctioned on a temporary basis and are subject to review in light of the emerging needs of the pupil(s) concerned.

All relatively new previously grant aided furniture and equipment provided by my Department was required to be transferred to the new building and the provision for an additional €6,500 set up grant for the autistic unit is also available for draw down by the school authority. It is not the policy of my Department to encourage retrospective funding for works of a capital nature. All works of a capital nature requiring capital investment from my Department should be approved in the first instance by my Department's planning unit, thus ensuring that financial pressure is not placed upon the parents or boards of management of schools.

The regulation introduces a differential calculation system for fees for oil tankers to be followed by port, harbour and pilotage authorities reach the objective of the IMO resolution. The objective of the regulation is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly oil tankers.The Harbours Acts 1996 to 2000 provide that a port company, such as Shannon Foynes Port Company, operating under the Acts, may, in respect of pilotage services that are provided by pilots in its pilotage district, impose charges at such rates as are from time to time determined by it. Section 80(2) of the Harbours Act 1996 provides for the possibility of a ministerial direction to a port company requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind in relation to the levels of pilotage charges imposed. My Department has consulted the Office of the Attorney General about the application in Ireland of the regulation and in particular in relation to the Shannon estuary. The Attorney General was of the view that there had not been a breach of the regulation and noted that the European Commission was also of this view. In the circumstances, the Attorney General advised that a direction by me under section 80(2) was not necessary.

However, there has been considerable difficulty regarding the acquisition of a site for the new building. The purchase of a site was agreed between the Irish Coastguard and the site owners, but difficulty has arisen in respect of both title, which is required to obtain planning permission for the proposed station house, and price. The Office of Public Works, which is the project manager for the Coastguard, is at present in negotiations with the site owners to advance the matters of both title and purchase.When this has been resolved and the site agreed, planning permission will be applied for and the tendering process commenced.

In September 1999 Donegal County Council submitted an application to my Department for funding for works at Leenan Pier. The proposal included the provision of a crane at the harbour at an estimated cost €76,184. In December 2000 the Department contributed €56,323.04 towards a site investigation at the harbour. The question of providing funding for the provision of a crane at Leenan Harbour will depend on the amount of Exchequer funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.

The club held no previous foreshore lease or licence in the area concerned. The application was made on the basis that the foreshore in question was in State ownership, and initial processing was carried out on that basis. Since then, however, questions have arisen as to whether the ownership is in the hands of the State or Dublin Port Company, and my Department's legal advisers are investigating the matter.Every effort will be made to resolve the matter as quickly as possible, so that consideration of the club's application can be finalised, in the appropriate manner, as soon as possible.

As a result of departmental reconfiguration over time and, in particular, the establishment of the State forestry agency, Coillte, the accounts branch of my Department based in Castlebar today consists of 18 staff.Given the number of years that have elapsed and the extent of reconfiguration of departmental boundaries since this decentralisation, my Department is not in a position to source the specific information requested by the Deputy in regard to the Castlebar decentralisation.

The most recent survey, carried out in 2000, estimated total employment in the industry, including full-time and part-time jobs, at about 15,000.The successful restructuring of the whitefish fleet brought about by the whitefish renewal scheme and the fleet development measure has resulted in consolidation within the whitefish sector as modern, safe and efficient units replace a larger number of smaller, older and less seaworthy craft. While this has meant an inevitable reduction of overall employment within the catching sector, the quality and sustainability of the jobs going forward has vastly improved.According to data provided by BIM, seafood exports for 2003 amounted to €384.3 million while sales on the home market were valued at €281 million, giving a total of just under €665 million.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The Marine Institute, acting on the Department's behalf, has responsibility for fish health matters. The institute carries out inspections on, and samples fish from, every aquaculture site in the State at least once a year in line with the requirements of EU Directive 91/67 concerning fish health.The import of live fish from EU member states must also be certified in accordance with that directive. Additional health certification in regard to fish imports from non-EU countries is also required, in line with the standards laid down by the World Animal Health Organisation.The institute is also consulted in regard to movements of live fish within the State. Such movements require a written permit from my Department following this consultation and confirmation that the fish involved are healthy and free of disease. Under the terms of current aquaculture licences, abnormal fish mortalities must be notified to the Department and the institute within 24 hours and such instances are investigated immediately.I want to assure the Deputy that the measures in place to control the spread of fish diseases are robust and comprehensive. The fact that Ireland is free of most of the diseases listed in EU Directive 91/67 and has a record second to none in controlling the small number of instances which have occurred is a vote of confidence in these procedures.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	750	Ireland's national quotas for 2004 show a 7.8% overall growth, in volume terms, on the equivalent figure for 2003. While this figure includes a modest reduction in the whitefish and shellfish quotas, from 37,635 tonnes in 2003 to 36,005 tonnes in 2004, it includes a significant 10.6% increase in the pelagic quotas this year. In addition, the quotas of whitefish and shellfish available to the Irish fishing fleet in 2004 exceed the landings figure for the fleet in 2002, the latest year for which figures are available. Taking account of this and the trend in pelagic quotas specified earlier, the outlook for the sector in 2004 is for a modest increase in overall fish landing this year. Assuming no reduction in average prices achieved for this catch, a similar figure will also apply in value terms.The catching sector together with associated processing industries onshore, continue to make a major contribution to employment and income in our coastal regions. It is my policy to maximise these economic and social benefits within a framework aimed at ensuring stability and sustainability in the industry going forward.

One of its key objectives is to assist voluntary and community groups, sports organisations and other bodies with their development of facilities in appropriate locations to maximise participation in sport and recreation.High priority in allocating these capital grants is given to projects that are closely linked to participation in sport, for example, pitch development, floodlights and dressing rooms and showers. One of the criteria used to assess applications is the extent a project will increase participation levels in sport and improve performance levels.It is not possible to assist with the provision of personnel under the sports capital programme. The Irish Sports Council is a statutory body responsible for the promotion and development of sport and my Department continues to give it substantial funding.Funding provided to the council has been increased from €13 million in 2000 to €30.75 million this year. The council has been able to develop and fund a wide range of high quality programmes and initiatives in the area of sports participation by all age groups in the community, for example, the local sports partnership programme and the raising of performance standards through the funding of various coaching, training and development officer programmes operated by the national governing bodies of sport.The allocation of more than €267 million to 3,500 sports facilities under the sports capital programme since 1998 has helped provide a framework for the council. It can deliver its strategic plan for Irish sport based on participation, performance and excellence.

No staff survey on transfers has been undertaken yet and, therefore, the information sought is not available. The implementation committee is chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. Conducting a survey before it prepares a plan would be premature and of limited value. I hope to conduct a survey on completion of the implementation plan when information on timelines for the sequencing of all the various moves is available. Staff will then be able to make informed decisions.

The Irish representative at the meeting voted in favour of the Commission's proposal. The decision was based on the scientific risk assessment undertaken on the product, initially by the Netherland's/Dutch food assessment body and subsequently by the EU Scientific Committee on Food. It was concluded that BT11 sweet maize is as safe for use by humans as conventional sweet maize.Ireland's position also reflected the fact that safeguard measures on labelling and traceability are in place following the completion of the European legislative framework for GMOs earlier this year. The new legislation ensures the full traceability of GMOs from farm to table. It also provides consumers with comprehensive information by labelling all food and feed consisting of, containing or produced from a GMO.As a qualified majority was not achieved in the vote on 8 December, the matter was recently referred to Council for a decision. It has three months from the referral date to adopt or reject the proposal by qualified majority. If a qualified majority is not achieved, the proposal will revert to the Commission which may make the decision under its own authority. My officials are consulting officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food with a view to bringing the matter to Council in the near future.Ireland's national position on the Council will continue to be based on the scientific risk assessment that BT11 sweet maize is as safe as conventional sweet maize. Ireland, as Council President, will be obliged to act in a neutral fashion and will seek to resolve the issue by a qualified majority.I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of authorised GM foods, or foods containing GM ingredients, placed on the market in Ireland. The EU has one of the most rigorous regimes for the assessment of GMOs as well as food and feed derived from GMOs. Only GM foods that satisfy the highest safety standards are allowed on the market.

My Department allocated funding to the NEHB to address the drug abuse in the region. The allocation for the past three years is as follows: €842,000 in 2002; €874,000 in 2003; and €893,000 in 2004.The funding allocated to boards reflect a number of factors, including the prevalence and severity of drug abuse, population size and an assessment of relative need. Funding allocated to the ERHA reflects its population size and the prevalence of drug abuse.The NEHB's chief executive officer informed me that it provides a comprehensive range of services in the area of substance abuse. Services are delivered in conjunction with general practitioners and pharmacists within primary care settings. Counselling, outreach, education and prevention services are provided in community settings such as schools, third level institutions and sports clubs. The board's service also embraces community development through working with groups such as the Drogheda Drugs and Alcohol Forum, the South Meath Alcohol and Drug Misuse Response and the Pillar Support group for parents of drug users.The board also provides secondary and tertiary care through counselling and outreach, involving families where appropriate. Secondary and tertiary care is also facilitated through links with the psychiatric and psychology services, voluntary agencies such as the Bradan day programme and Tabor House. There is also a link with residential rehabilitation programmes such as those offered by Aislinn and Rutland. The board is also a lead agency in the regional drugs task force and has co-ordinated its establishment under the national drugs strategy.The board's chief executive officer informed me that it is constantly looking at new and innovative ways to enhance its services. That includes the following: the provision of information nights for parents in schools and other settings; the provision of information and advice for young people and parents through its interactive website and helpline; the training of parents in communication skills, self-esteem development, coping mechanisms; and the provision of skills to support others in similar situations. The board expects to launch the regional drugs task force action plan this year.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	771	My decision to make nicotine replacement therapies available to medical card holders was taken on foot of recommendations made by the cardiovascular health strategy group and the advisory forum established to support the task force in the implementation of strategy.A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drugs payment scheme to ensure equity in a range of medicines paid for by the State. A product must satisfy a number of criteria for it to become a reimbursable item under both schemes. These include not being advertised or promoted and being prescription only. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that would not normally satisfy these criteria. They are generally available over the counter and may be advertised directly to the public.In light of the recommendations that have been made to me I have decided, as an exceptional measure, to make the full range of nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders. Evidence shows that lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco. Accordingly, this group is in greatest need of assistance to quit smoking.

I am aware that there are currently difficulties surrounding the operation of the in-patient unit at the Galway Hospice and that no new patients are being admitted at present. However, home care and day care services are continuing to be provided to approximately 100 patients by the foundation with those patients who require consultant-led specialist in-patient care being admitted to University College Hospital, Galway.The Western Health Board has informed my Department that an independent expert group was established by the Galway Hospice Foundation to review procedures at the hospice and that it is expected that the report of the expert group will be available in the near future.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The waiting list data for the period ended 30 September 2003 showed that there were significant reductions in the number of adults and children waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties has fallen by approximately 42% in the period September 2002 to September 2003. The total number of children waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment in the target specialties has decreased by approximately 39% in the same period.Significant progress has been made in many health board areas to achieve reductions in waiting times. This has been achieved through active management of long waiting lists at a local level and the involvement of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. Up to the end of January 2004, close to 10,500 patients had already received treatment through the NTPF. All health boards outside of the eastern region are reporting that, in general, those adults currently reported to be waiting more than 12 months and those children reported to be waiting more than six months have either been offered treatment under the NTPF or have conditions that are complicated and need to be treated locally. It is now the case that, in most instances, adults waiting more than six months for an operation and children waiting more than three months will now be facilitated by the NTPF.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Pressures on the hospital system arise from demands on emergency departments and on difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. There are a number of initiatives under way to deal with these pressures.Planning for the discharge of patients by acute hospitals and the liaison with the community services has been prioritised on an ongoing basis by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Initiatives such as Homefirst, Slán Abhaile and home subvention are all contributing to providing alternative care packages for older people so that they can be discharged.The single most important factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A report called Acute Hospital Bed Capacity — A National Review, carried out by my Department, identified a requirement for an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospitals by 2011, and this requirement is reflected in the Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness- A Health System for You. Some 568 of the 709 beds in the first phase have been commissioned to date of which 260 are in the eastern region. Funding is available to enable the balance of the 709 beds to be brought into operation this year.Also under the acute bed capacity initiative, I have provided an additional €12.6 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, €8.8 million, and to the Southern Health Board, €3.8million, to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting thereby freeing up acute beds. It allows for funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community. Already this funding has resulted in the discharge of over 200 patients from acute hospitals in the eastern region. The ERHA is actively monitoring the situation and working with hospitals and the area health boards to ensure that every effort is being made to minimise the number of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The ERHA has reported that it is working closely with the major acute hospitals in Dublin with a view to re-opening beds which were temporarily closed last year.As part of the winter initiative, an additional 20 accident and emergency consultants have been appointed from the 29 approved. Additional appointments are being progressed by the health boards and the ERHA.Reviews of the bed management function and nurse staffing levels in emergency departments are being progressed by the Health Services Employers Agency in consultation with health service management representatives and the nursing unions.Emergency medicine departments may sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions which are more appropriate to a primary care setting. General practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives have been established and are operating in at least part of all the health board areas, with one health board, the North Eastern Health Board, having a region-wide project. A total of €46.5 million has been allocated for the development of out-of-hours co-operatives between 1997 and 2003. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the various health agencies in looking for short-term and longer term solutions to the current difficulties.

This is provisional as the final figures for 2003 will not be available until the annual financial statements have been prepared and submitted for audit by 1 April next.The 1996 accountability legislation requires health boards to transfer a deficit or a surplus for the preceeding year to the following year. Accordingly, the Mid-Western Health Board has included such surplus funding in its service plan-budget for 2004 and this plan has been passed by its board.Following on from meetings with health boards on 2004 service plans, Department officials met with some health boards to discuss issues arising and requiring follow-up. In relation to those boards which recorded surpluses at the end of 2003, discussions covered the background to the financial outcome and intended use of such once-off funding in 2004.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	792	My Department and the health services generally operate within the context of a Government approved framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. The purpose of the framework is to establish common procedures in each of the frontline emergency services for activating emergency plans and co-ordination, control and co-operation during peacetime emergencies.The Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and each of the health boards has an emergency plan which is based on this framework and which is kept under constant review. The main aim of the plans is to ensure that the health service is in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to best advantage so that the resulting response will be appropriate, structured, co-ordinated and effectively managed. The emergency plan can be activated by the ambulance service, fire service or the Garda.Each health board or health authority has out-of-hours contact details for a number of officials in my Department for use in the event of a major emergency. These officials are not on a roster and are not paid any additional remuneration for carrying out this function.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	795	As outlined in my reply to Question No. 236 of 2 December 2003, Ireland is legally obliged to begin applying the conditions stipulated in the European Working Time Directive to doctors in training from 1 August 2004, and I am determined that every effort will be made to effect these employment rights. Discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation on the implementation of the directive as it relates to doctors in training have re-convened in the Labour Relations Commission. The most recent meeting took place on 17 February 2004. Management and the Irish Medical Organisation have confirmed their commitment to engagement to achieve the required reduction in non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours. A number of further meetings have been planned and it is hoped that the negotiations can be completed within a ten week timeframe.The report of the National Taskforce on Medical Staffing — the Hanly report — specifies a number of national initiatives which, when combined with appropriate local action, provide the capacity to deliver on the requirements of the European Working Time Directive in respect of the reduction of working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors by 1 August 2004. These initiatives are as follows: reduction of tiered on-call by different grades of non-consultant hospital doctors; introduction of cross-cover arrangements; new non-consultant hospital doctor working patterns; rostering of hospital medical staff; and changes in skill-mix and practice for other grades of hospital staff.The Hanly report also recommends a review of a range of work patterns, accurate recording of information and centralised rostering by each health agency; and at a national level, regulation by a single national agency of all hospital medical posts, subject to independent approval of training posts based on training criteria. Other steps recommended to reduce the working week as required include the appointment of a national group to implement the task force's proposals on tiered on-call, cross-cover and other relevant issues to monitor progress regarding the reduction in non-consultant hospital doctors' hours, and the immediate establishment of a working group in each hospital to work with the national group and to progress measures proposed by the task force for the reduction of non-consultant hospital doctors' hours at local level. These groups are to include appropriate hospital managers, consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, nurses and other relevant health care professionals. Arrangements for the establishment of these groups were discussed with the Irish Medical Organisation at the last meeting in the Labour Relations Commission and it is my wish to have them operational at an early date.Consultation and planning on the implementation of the European Working Time Directive requirements for non-consultant hospital doctors is ongoing. This week, the chief executive officers of health boards and hospital managers, together with senior officials from my Department and the Health Service Employers Agency, met to discuss developments to date and to agree further steps at national and local level which are required to implement the directive by 1 August. Ongoing communication and co-ordination structures will support this process. A national co-ordinator and support team are being seconded from the health agencies to oversee this process. Medical manpower managers who were approved under the 2000 non-consultant hospital doctor agreement are also playing a central role in the implementation arrangements.The appointment of a national steering group, under an independent chairman, to oversee and co-ordinate the reduction in non-consultant hospital doctor working hours has also been agreed. The inter-agency health care forum and the medical stakeholders group will have an important role to play in maintaining open liaison between agencies. Fast-tracking the work-up of draft rosters in a representative group of hospitals based on detailed information which has been collated is being progressed. An expert on rostering issues, who acted as a previous consultant to the Hanly group, has been retained in an advisory capacity. The medical education and training group of the Hanly task force is continuing its work and engaging with the training colleges on the provision of appropriate training within the requirements of the directive. It is intended to agree appropriate protocols-parameters in this regard.As the working week for non-consultant hospital doctors will be reduced from the current average of 77 hours to 58 hours, as required under the directive, this should result in significant financial flexibility in the implementation of the necessary measures. I am confident that, as the benefits of adopting the directive's measures are increasingly recognised, all parties involved will continue to co-operate to bring about the successful achievement of healthier and safer working conditions for doctors and safer provision of services to patients.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board may arrange for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with any of the following conditions who do not have a medical card for the treatment of that condition under the long term illness scheme: mental handicap; mental illness — for people under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism; conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.The assessment procedures for granting a long-term illness card are the responsibility of each health board. People with any of the listed illnesses may apply directly to their local board for admission to the scheme. If the Deputy is aware of specific cases where he considers that eligibility has been incorrectly withdrawn, he should forward the details directly to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Where the Deputy has specific complaints about the operation of the overall scheme by health boards, he should supply details directly to my Department.

In this case, the responsibility rests with the South Western Area Health Board. My Department has requested the chief executive of the South Western Area Health Board to look into the matter and to reply direct to the deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.In July 2003, I made additional funding of €5.5 million available to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, €3.8 million, and the Southern Health Board, €1.7 million, to allow them access appropriate care package for patients occupying acute beds but whose acute phase of treatment was over. The operational capacity of acute hospitals in the Dublin and Cork areas in particular are restricted by the continued occupancy of beds by patients who could be discharged if appropriate facilities were available elsewhere. The full year cost of this initiative is €12.6 million, of which €8.8 million is available to the ERHA and €3.8 million to the Southern Health Board. My Department has asked the chief executive officers of the Southern Health Board and the ERHA to provide the most up-to-date position to the Deputy in relation tothe number of persons to benefit from this initiative.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	804	Implementation of action 52 is well under way in the health system.All regions have undertaken initiatives to inform and educate the public about the national health strategy and health service reform programme. A variety of mechanisms are used including websites, information sessions and booklets, newspaper features, radio slots and education units.Guidelines on a health service approach to community participation were produced in 2002 by the health boards executive in association with my Department. Two boards have established regional advisory panels/co-ordinating commit-tees for older consumers and their carers. A further two boards have a consumer panel on services for older consumers.The expert group on mental health policy, established in August 2003 to prepare a new national policy framework for the mental health services, has received 140 submissions from interested organisations, individuals and the general public. Further consultation with various stakeholders including users of mental health services is planned. Regional advisory panels/co-ordinating committees in regard to services for people with a mental illness have not been established as yet, although three boards have indicated that other initiatives are under way to consult users of mental health services.Six boards have established consumer panels dealing with issues such as service delivery; service development; environmental factors; appointment times; complaints; local service developments; and development of multidisciplinary primary care services.The national consultative forum is convened on an annual basis to monitor the implementation of the national health strategy. The forum is broadly based and includes patient and client groups, service providers, senior management in the health system, the voluntary sector, organisations with an interest in the health system and relevant Government departments.In May 2003, my Department and the Combat Poverty Agency jointly launched the agency's building healthy communities programme, which has a special focus on community development approaches to reducing health inequalities.The primary care strategy, Primary Care — A New Direction, contains a commitment to the strengthening of community participation in primary care by encouraging and facilitating the involvement of local community and voluntary groups in the planning and delivery of primary care services. In the first instance, this is being given effect in the development of the initial group of ten primary care teams around the country. The health boards, which have the lead role in the process, have been exploring different mechanisms to engage with communities and users of primary care services in the areas involved. The national primary care steering group, through its sub-group on community involvement and health, is also considering how, at both a strategic and an operational level, community involvement in the planning and delivery of primary care services can be given practical effect. These mechanisms for community participation will be further advanced in the restructured health system.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	805	Students undertaking the nursing degree programme receive a means tested higher education grant from the Department of Education and Science similar to all third level students.I have made enquiries of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and under his Department's higher education grant scheme, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states, including the UK. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Also, tax relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.In recent years, the UK authorities introduced a number of changes in the financial support arrangements for students pursuing courses at further and higher education institutions. This included the introduction of an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time from the 1998-99 academic year and the replacement of maintenance grants by student loans to be phased in from that year also. All EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee, subject to the same conditions as apply to UK studentsAn Bord Altranais is the statutory regulatory body for the nursing profession in Ireland and is responsible for nursing registration. In carrying out its registration function, An Bord Altranais must comply with the relevant EU directives concerning the education and training of nurses. There should be no difficulty in registering nurses trained in the EU, including the UK, as long as their education and training complies with the standards set out in the EU directives. The number of nurses with UK qualifications who have been registered with An Bord Altranais since 2001 is as follows: 2001, 1,219; 2002, 1,017; and 2003, 815.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I propose to take Questions Nos. 403 and 405 together.The number of staff within my Department who have volunteered to date for the programme of decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day is set out in the following table. A total of 526 staff out of a staff complement of 690 have replied to a document seeking expressions of interest in decentralisation. The detail provided on the attached table broken down by location and grade is not totalled as in many instances an individual head of staff has applied for a number of locations, thereby making totals by grade/location quite misleading.With regard to the implications for the Department of Health and Children, of the public service decentralisation plan, my Department must await a decision by the Government on the location of the headquarters of the Health Service Executive as this Department's own reform agenda will impact directly on the decentralisation options available to the Department of Health and Children staff.I trust that the Deputy will appreciate that my Department is not in a position to carry out a risk assessment of the decentralisation plans at present.LocationAsst SecPOProf.APHEOAOEOSOCOArklow001010102Athlone000121305Athy010221103Balbriggan000010101Ballinasloe000111311Ballybofey000000001Birr000211301Buncrana000021101Carlow001121101Carrickmacross000011101Carrick-on-Shannon000210415Castlebar000000000Cavan000112202Claremorris000141423Clifden000101110Clonakilty000120202Cork000010201Curragh010032304Donegal000012102Drogheda000261506Dundalk000000201Dungarvan001001200Edenderry000001002Enniscorthy001010002Furbo000201111Galway000010000Gweedore000000002Kanturk000010100Kilkenny001242201Killarney000031102Kilrush000110100Knock Airport000231424Letterkenny000000001Limerick000211300Listowel000011000Longford000100013Loughrea000211211Macroom000100001Mallow000110201Maynooth000010001Mitchelstown000010100Monaghan000002101Mullingar000212407Naas000010000Navan000140306New Ross001121102Newbridge010132306Newcastle West000000100Portarlington000221203Portlaoise000451403Roscommon000210217Roscrea000340100Shannon000310400Sligo000210201Thomastown001200000Thurles000341100Tipperary000231200Trim000240303Tuam000000001Tullamore000221503Waterford001142200Wexford001172102Youghal000110300
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	810	On foot of a Government decision in 1992, a portion of my Department, namely the General Register's Office — GRO — decentralised to Roscommon in 1996. In order to retain an acceptable level of service to the public, and to allow for the modernisation of the service provided by the GRO including the introduction of new legislation and information technology, it was decided to proceed with the decentralisation on a phased basis.There are now 40 staff employed in the decentralised office. Of this number, three staff transferred from my Department, six staff were directly recruited, and the balance of 31 transferred from other Departments. It is not possible to give accurate information concerning people changes and job changes until the decentralisation of the GRO is completed. The once-off set-up cost to my Department, which consisted of furniture, floor coverings etc., amounted to €195,000.Work is now under way on a new office building in Roscommon which will be completed by the end of 2004. The decentralisation of the remainder of the GRO will be completed in spring of 2005.

The new structures set out in the reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management and will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. I am confident that the programme is in the interests of an improved system of patient-centred service delivery, greater accountability, quality and value for money. The precise arrangements for service delivery in any particular area will be determined by the HSE in due course.

The authority has also advised that it has been working with the South Western Area Health Board to resolve staffing issues at the unit and that an advertisement for staff will be placed in the national media in the near future. The authority has further advised that it hopes that the remaining beds at the unit will be fully occupied during April 2004.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	816	I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.The penalty points system, which is provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002 was introduced with effect from 31 October 2002 for the offence of breaching a speed limit, from 1 June 2003 for insurance offences and from 25 August 2003 for seat belt wearing offences. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of such offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge — in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences — to the Garda to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.As regards speeding, penalty points are endorsed on the licence record held in the national driver file upon conviction for a speeding offence, or upon payment of a fixed charge for speeding. In the case of latter offences, the system operates in such a way that the offer of paying a fixed charge is always provided and a person has 56 days within which to pay the charge. The 56 day period comprises an initial 28 day period within which €80 fixed charge can be paid, followed by a further 28 day period within which a fixed charge of €120 can be paid. If a person opts not to pay, the case is taken to court. These periods are built into the system and ensure that every opportunity is afforded to the person to pay the fixed charge and avoid a court hearing.There is therefore an inevitable and intrinsic time lapse between the issue of the notices, the payment of the fixed charge and the notification of the endorsement of penalty points. The fact that, at present, the processing of notices by the Garda is operated on a manual basis is a further contributory factor to those time lapses. The timing of the issue of fixed charge notices is a matter for the Garda Síochána.The Road Traffic Act 2002 contains a specific structure that applies directly to the effective application of penalty points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that, where penalty points are to be endorsed in a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5.The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the courts service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force.Both the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána transfer the appropriate data relating to convictions and payment of fixed charges to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. As the processing of data by the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána is operated on a manual basis, the data relating to convictions and payment of fixed charges are received in non-electronic format by a company engaged by my Department to convert such data for transmission electronically to the national driver file. Currently this process takes about five working days from date of receipt of the data from the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána. There are no major delays in my Department in the administration of the penalty point system.

This project is designed to increase capacity on the entire DART network by providing eight-car DARTs on peak hour trains, increasing platform lengths and achieving full accessibility at all DART stations. This phase of the project is due for completion in 2005. I understand that the project is proceeding satisfactorily and that work on the line from Connolly Station to Howth Junction, affecting Harmonstown, Killester and Clontarf stations in particular, will commence later in the year. When phase one of the project is completed, Iarnród Éireann will have doubled the capacity of the DART system in less than five years.

It is not the practice on security grounds to disclose the existence or otherwise of air marshals on any aircraft that may use an airport in the State. In common with other states, the Irish position concerning the acceptance of in-flight security personnel on foreign aircraft arriving at Irish airports has been a willingness to permit such operations subject to appropriate protocols and procedures being agreed in advance with the State of the carrier concerned.

There are now 67 of this Department's staff working in Ballina.While a very small number of individual records may exist in my Department which might form part of the information requested by the Deputy, the time and resources required to identify these records would be totally disproportionate to the value of the information obtained.

The broadly based working group which carried out the review recommended that speed limits should range from a high of 120 kph — equivalent to 74.580 mph — on motorways to 50 kph -equivalent to 31.075 mph — in built-up areas. The working group also recommended that a special limit of 30 kph — equivalent to 18.645 mph — should be applied on a very restrictive basis in residential areas where traffic calming measures have been provided. Within that range, the working group specifically recommended that the speed limit for non-urban regional and local roads should be 80 kph — equivalent to 49.790 mph. This represents a significant decrease on the speed limit of 60 mph that currently applies to what is the vast majority of the rural road network.In light of that particular proposal and having regard to the fact that the overall structure proposed is very similar to that which is currently in place there would not be seem to be a case for suggesting that the new system will give rise to any significant increase in the emission levels of greenhouse gases.I propose to bring forward legislative measures shortly to provide for a new metricated speed limit structure based on the recommendations made by the working group.

These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access.I have received representations seeking to extend access to bus lanes in relation to a wide range of other road users including hackney and limousine operators and motorcyclists.I do not have any immediate proposals to review the question of extending access to bus lanes to other road users. However, as I have already indicated on previous occasions in this House I will review the question when the number of bus lanes has doubled.

She remained in the State beyond the 90 days and did not register with the Garda authorities until 7 April 2003. During her period in the State, she did not seek or gain employment, had insufficient means with which to support herself and her daughter and was maintained throughout by social welfare payments.The case file in respect of this woman and her daughter was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, having regard to all the representations made on their behalf. On 28 October 2003 deportation orders were made in respect of them and on 8 December 2003 they were deported. The effect of the deportation orders is that they must leave the State and remain out of it thereafter.

It has no role in relation to the payment of rent supplements to enable asylum seekers access the private rented sector. It also provides self catering accommodation in extenuating circumstances to a small number of asylum seekers. Refugees and persons given leave to remain in the State essentially have access on the same basis as Irish citizens to the general housing stock, and as such, the RIA has no information on the individual locations of this cohort of immigrants.The information sought by the Deputy in respect of asylum seekers accommodated by the RIA in direct provision and self catering facilities for the years in question is set out in the following table. It should also be noted that while the RIA has no specific detailed information on the number of asylum seekers accommodated in the private rented sector in receipt of rent supplements by health boards, it is understood that over 5,000, claims approximately 50% of claims in the State by non-EEA nationals — are currently in payment in the greater Dublin area.Direct ProvisionCapacityCapacityCapacityDec ’01Dec ’02Dec ’032 The Mall, Youghal120069 Jamestown Road, Inchicore, Dublin 8140070 The Manor, Waterford2000Aasleagh House, 13 Cuan Glas, Galway2500Abbington Guest House, 12 Cuan Glas, Galway2500An Poc Fada, Cobh434343Ashbourne House Hotel, Glounthane, Cork114110108Atlantic House + Coltro, Tramore696074Atlantic Lodge, Kenmare606056Atlantic View Guesthouse, Salthill, Galway3300Atlas House, Killarney07594Atlas House, Tralee00100Ballymullen Barracks, Tralee120120120Barrington’s Lodge, George’s Street, Limerick9000Bawn Lodge Guesthouse, Strokestown2000Beechlawn B & B, Corballis, Rathdrum252020Benamore House, Old Dublin Road, Roscrea1700Bridgewater House, Carrick-on-Suir404095Brookvale Hotel, Bunbeg, Letterkenny3000Camden Hall Hotel, 1 Upper Camden St. Dublin 2858576Camden House, Dublin 2.0019Cashel Holiday Hostel, 6 John Street, Cashel2800Ceide House, Ballycastle1500Cliffview, Donegal Town625555Clodagh Bar, Main St., Borrisoleigh402020Clonakilty Lodge, Clonakilty959090Clyde House, St. Alphonsus St., Limerick100100100Corofin Holiday Hostel, Corofin201818Dun Gibbons Inn, Clifden928181Eglinton Hotel, Salthill, Galway250250250Eyre Powell Hotel, Main St., Newbridge00100Glen Vera, Wellington Road, Cork10795104Golflinks Hotel, Glengarriff6500Great Western House, Eyre Square, Galway198180180Harcourt Inn, 27 Harcourt Street, Dublin 27600Hibernian Hotel, Abbeylei456060Hillview, Prosperous0030Homefield House Hotel, Bundoran302020Inisfail House, Main Street, Baltinglass2200Island View House, Morrison’s Quay, Cork11000Johnston Marina, Tralee106106106Kilmarnock House, Military Rd., Killiney00110Kincora House, Seatown Place, Dundalk403535Kinsale Road Accommodation Centre, Cork72200300Knockalisheen156300300Lissywoolen Accommodation Centre, Athlone400375375Lough Muckno, Castleblayney4500Magee Barracks, Kildare Town.175175175Millstreet Accommodation Centre, Millstreet6085145Milverton House, Montgomery St., Carlow403230Mosney Holiday Centre, Mosney551769769Moville Holiday Hostel, Main Street, Moville151212Newlight House, St. Margarets38032North Quay Place, Cork274274274Oaklands Hotel, Glenamaddy3000Ocean View + Boathouse, Tramore555375Old Rectory, Rosbercon, New Ross304058Old Convent, Ballyhaunis908484Ormonde House Hotel, John’s Green, Kilkenny1008282Ox Mountain Lodge, Tubbercurry800Park Lodge, Killarney546055Park Place Hotel, Killarney0062Railway Hotel, James’ St., Kiltimagh0050Red Cottage, Bundoran Rd., Sligo302225Richmond Court, Richmond St., Longford705066Riverbed, Longford20140Scariff Court Hotel, Main St. Scariff50075Shannonside Holiday Hostel, Old Cratloe Rd.

The programme for Government commits me to creating a drug free prison service with mandatory drug testing of prisoners. I intend to put this commitment into effect and expect to receive shortly from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel a new set of prison rules which will make provision for creating drug free prisons and for the effective use of mandatory drug testing.A group consisting of Irish prison service management, prison governors and health board staff together with relevant clinicians have drafted a prison drug treatment policy. This policy would, in so far as practical, seek to apply consistent regulation and operational structure to the provision of drug treatment services both in the general community and in prison. I am currently considering this draft policy.It is both my policy and that of the Irish prison service, in common with most prison systems worldwide, not to issue needles or injecting equipment to prisoners. Emphasis within prisons is on health education and appropriate substitution treatment, etc., where required. The report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services considered the matter of developing a syringe exchange programme within Irish prisons and came to the conclusion that, on the basis of potential risk to staff, such a step could not be recommended.Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the conference referred to by the Deputy.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	839	I propose to take Questions Nos. 436, 454 and 455 together.The Deputies will be aware that on 11 November 2003, the Government approved a series of measures to be taken on a rolling basis with effect from 1 January 2004 in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on a change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Irish prison service. These measures included the mothballing of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention and the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into independently managed post-release centres for the reintegration of prisoners into society.The reasons for the Government decision have been well aired in the House and the Seanad. I would refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debates in this House on 12, 18 and 27 November 2003 and to an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on 19 November, 2003. In the course of those debates, I made it clear that the Irish Prison Service could not continue to spend public money to feed an overtime culture which was virtually out of control, while maintaining outdated and inefficient work practices. I also made it clear that I had no desire to close or mothball prisons and that my preference was for a mutually advantageous agreement with the Prison Officers' Association which would ensure an efficient and cost effective prison service into the future. My position has not changed in that regard.In the absence of agreement with the Prison Officers' Association, the Curragh place of detention closed on 20 January 2004 and Fort Mitchel closed on 10 February 2004. I have no plans at present to reopen either of the two facilities.As regards Shelton Abbey, I temporarily deferred its closure and the closure of Loughan House for logistical reasons, and in the context of contact with the Labour Relations Commission in the lead-up to last week's resumption of talks with the Prison Officers' Association. The future of these two institutions will be kept under continuing review in the light of progress in the talks. In the event that it becomes necessary to transform Shelton Abbey and Loughan House into post-release centres, neither facility would remain under the control of the Irish Prison Service. Alternative staffing arrangements will be a matter for the new management.I am further informed that, subject to no queries arising, the application will be completed within the next few weeks.

The number of staff currently serving in the laboratory is 64 — filling 61 posts. The Department is endeavouring to fill the vacant posts as quickly as possible. I can also inform the Deputy that the Department will give every assistance to the management of the laboratory as regards any other resources required to fulfil its mandate.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	842	The person concerned entered the State on 22 April 1999 and applied for asylum on 23 April 1999. The Refugee Applications Commissioner recommended that his claim be refused and he was informed of this recommendation on 29 February 2000. He appealed this recommendation on 7 March 2000. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal affirmed the recommendation and he was informed of this decision on 12 July 2002.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, he was informed on 29 August 2002 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and was given the following options: to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons he should be allowed to remain in the State, to voluntarily leave the State or to consent to deportation. An application for leave to remain was submitted on 17 September 2002 which included a letter dated 10 September 2002 stating that the person concerned was awaiting an appointment with a consultant neurosurgeon. Further correspondence was received from the legal representatives of the person concerned on 14 August 2003. The only medical report on file is a note dated 13 December 2001 indicating that the person has a long standing medical condition.The case file in this matter will be submitted to me shortly for decision in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. Regard shall be had to the criteria set out in section 3(6) of that Act, taking into account the information which the person concerned has chosen to provide and to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 prohibiting  refoulement.

The average processing time for declarations of post-nuptial citizenship is approximately eight months.The declaration and its supporting documentation have recently been examined by officials in the citizenship section of my Department. I have been informed that it is necessary to clarify a couple of matters and a letter has issued to the person concerned in the last few days.I will advise the Deputy when the matter has been concluded.

Application Number 04GR00048 refers.I am further informed that the Land Registry has written to the applicants on 23 February 2003 and advised them on how to proceed with this application. I can assure the Deputy that on receipt of a reply from the applicants, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

Dealing Numbers D2003SM002847M and D2003SM003474E refer.I am further informed that the application for the registration of the transfer is dependent on the completion of the section 49 application. I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage.However, I can assure the Deputy that these applications are receiving attention in the Land Registry.

The application was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular it was considered that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of her obligations to return home following her proposed visit.It was noted that the person in question had made a previous visa application in December 2002, which had been refused. However, the applicant did not disclose this fact in the relevant questions in her recent visa application form.It is, of course, open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa by writing to the visa appeals officer in the Department.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	849	As the Deputy will be aware, as far as abduction of a child from Ireland to another state is concerned, both the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children have been incorporated into Irish law in the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Orders Act 1991. There is a network of central authorities established under the conventions for the purposes of assisting applicants and generally ensuring the effective operation of the conventions and the central authority for child abduction operates in my Department for the purposes of both conventions in this jurisdiction.The Hague Convention is designed to ensure the immediate return of children who have been removed from one contracting state to another — usually by a parent in defiance of the wishes of the other parent. It is based on the principle that the custody of a child should be decided by courts in the state in which the child habitually resides. The European Convention is designed to ensure that custody and access orders granted in one contracting state are recognised and enforced in other contracting states. Recognition and enforcement disputes usually arise when one parent removes a child from one state to another in defiance of a court order granting custody or access rights to the other parent.In addition, sections 16 and 17 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 prescribe offences applying to the abduction of children under 16 years.I am familiar with the "amber alert" which the US law enforcement agencies use to engage law enforcement, the media and the public in combating child abduction by sending out immediate, up to the minute information bulletins to aid in the child's safe recovery. It is intended only for the most serious, time-critical cases and is not used for cases involving runaways or parental abduction, except in life-threatening situations.I am informed by the Garda authorities that they regard the current arrangements and legislative provisions sufficient to deal with child abduction at this time.

This compares to a figure of 196 as at 31 December 1997 and represents an increase of 36 — or 18.3% — since that date. Tallaght Garda district is comprised of Rathfarnham and Tallaght Garda stations.I am further informed that the personnel strength — all ranks — of Tallaght Garda station as at 20 February 2004 was 162. This compares to a figure of 133 as at 31 December 1997 and represents an increase of 29 or 21.8% since that date.The personnel strength of Limerick division as at 20 February 2004 was 466, all ranks.Garda personnel allocated to Limerick division police the entire county of Limerick. Tallaght is just one of a number of Garda stations which make up the Dublin metropolitan region south division, which, as at 20 February 2004, has a personnel strength of 530 — all ranks .Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Tallaght area with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained.The situation will be kept under review and when additional resources next becomes available, the needs of Tallaght Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

This form of policing involves the community in the policing process with a focus on crime prevention.Urban areas, particularly in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford have dedicated community policing units. Community policing in rural areas is integrated with regular policing activities.Community policing units have responsibility for crime prevention initiatives such as neighbourhood watch, community alert, hospital safety and security and campus watch.The community policing programme was reviewed as part of the Garda organisations structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation and I will give careful consideration to all of its recommendations, including any it may make on the community policing programme.

However, all gardaí have a responsibility, inter alia, to deal with community policing issues as they arise.Community gardaí generally perform their duties on the beat. The number of gardaí on the beat at any given time varies depending on the time of day and the day of the week. For this reason, it is not possible to define the number of community gardaí on the beat at any given time in percentage terms relative to the number of gardaí that are performing their routine duty on the beat.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The rights and entitlements of victims of crime in Ireland are set out in the Victims Charter, published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 1999, following extensive consultations with all relevant agencies including the courts, the Garda Síochána, the Prison Service, the probation and welfare service, the State prosecution service and the Victim Support organisation.A guiding principle of the Victims Charter is a commitment to giving victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system. The charter makes specific provision for particularly vulnerable victims such as victims of sexual offences, domestic violence, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and children. It also contains specific provisions in relation to keeping victims informed of the outcome of their complaints, the progress of any criminal proceedings, and the outcome of these proceedings.The Irish Victim Support organisation has over 500 professionally trained volunteers countrywide helping over 7,700 victims of crime annually with a network of centres based in local communities in all parts of the country. In addition, the victim support organisation operates a court witness programme in the Circuit and Criminal Courts.It receives the bulk of its funding directly from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in the last five years the organisation has received over €5 million in direct funding from my Department. Among the aims of the organisation are to: assist victims of crime both in practical and emotional terms; offer advice and provide information in relation to matters relevant to victims such as compensation, legal aid, insurance cover, relevant statutory entitlements, etc.; and create a greater awareness throughout society about the plight of victims and to highlight the viewpoint of victims.The Garda Síochána has undertaken to provide help and support to victims of crime as one of the strategic goals of the Garda corporate strategy 2000-04 and, in the Garda policing plan 2004, has undertaken to strongly increase the number of referrals of victims of crime to the victim support organisation. I am informed that the Garda authorities have appointed victim liaison gardaí to liaise with the victims of crime and the victim support organisation.I understand from the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda Síochána as regards dealing with juveniles who offend is to consider the offender for inclusion in the Garda juvenile diversion programme. The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing, and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level. I am informed by the Garda authorities that persistent offenders would be unlikely to remain on the juvenile diversion programme. I am further informed in 2003 the Garda national juvenile office received 19,915 referrals under the programme relating to 17,050 individual offenders. The Deputy should note that these figures are provisional and are subject to a validation process. The programme is delivered throughout the country by 85 gardaí and eight sergeant juvenile liaison officers who are employed full time working with juvenile offenders.Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the Juvenile diversion programme. The restorative justice programme supports the victim by providing an opportunity in certain circumstances to attend a caution of the juvenile offender. The victim may take the opportunity to explain the harm done to him/her and receive an apology. Essentially, the provisions of the Children Act 2001 provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion. To facilitate these innovative developments, most of the Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected officers. Since the commencement of the relevant part of the Children Act in 2002 and up to the end of September 2003, almost 100 restorative justice events have been held. Early assessments indicate a very high level of satisfaction from all those involved in the process.Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. It is intended that as Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, they will be able to focus on the more complex and high-risk offenders, with a view to further reducing the incidence of recidivism.To ensure the effective operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme in accordance with section 44 of the Act, a committee to monitor the effectiveness of the programme, review all aspects of its operation and monitor the ongoing training needs of facilitators involved in restorative conferencing was established in June 2003.In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are in existence a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects. These projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.On the basis of commissioned evaluations of the Garda youth diversion projects, my Department, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána and other key stakeholders, commissioned the centre for social and educational research at the Dublin Institute of Technology to prepare comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of projects. It is anticipated that these guidelines will act as a benchmark against which applications for new projects will be assessed and against which existing projects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. The guidelines were officially launched at the Garda youth diversion projects annual conference in May 2003. As the Deputy may be aware, recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of these projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department. Funding of €5.318 million has been allocated to these and related projects in the current year.In summary, the Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda juvenile diversion programme and the Garda youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all situations, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turning in the process of maturing into young adults. Moreover, research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 88% do not come to the attention of the Garda Síochána again by their 18th birthday.I am informed by the Garda authorities that they monitor crime trends on an ongoing basis at national and local level and that Garda patrolling arrangements are adjusted to respond to the type of incidents referred to by the Deputy.

He is in custody since 12 February 2004 and is due to appear in Ennis District Court on 27 February 2004 on charges of wilful obstruction, failing to comply with the directions of a member of the Garda Síochána, obstruction of a peace officer and insulting behaviour in a public place. He has been on hunger strike since 15 February 2004 but is continuing to take liquids. As with any prisoner who embarks on such a form of protest he is seen daily by a prison doctor.As the Deputy is aware the courts are independent in the exercise of their constitutional functions and I do not have the authority to release any prisoner that the courts have specifically ordered remain in custody pending a future court appearance.

He subsequently withdrew this application on 11 September 2002 and made an application for residency in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish child born on 30 August 2002.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &  O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered, but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport him. If, in the light of representations received and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.Because of the large number of such cases on hand I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.

Details of the requirements of this scheme are available on the Department's website.The average processing time of applications for naturalisation currently is approximately 15 to 18 months. Consequently, it is likely that the application of the person concerned will be finalised in early 2005.As soon as I have reached a decision on the matter, I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy of the outcome.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The general issue of gazumping was examined by the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in October 1999. Its report examined the practice of taking booking deposits on the sale of new residential properties. The commission found that gazumping occurred in only a handful of cases, less than 5%, and almost always on the sale of new houses. They concluded that the current legal position, which does not confer any interest in property upon the payment of a booking deposit, generally benefits the purchaser more than the vendor, allowing the purchaser flexibility to conduct the necessary preliminary investigations before committing to an irrevocable agreement.Among the recommendations of the LRC report was the initiation of, and adherence to, voluntary codes of practice among the industry such as the home purchase protection pledge established by the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA.Under the IHBA code of practice, members must not increase the price of the property or accept any offer from any other party for the property for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit, during which time contracts should be exchanged and signed. The code stipulates that IHBA members are only entitled to increase the price of properties in circumstances where VAT rates have changed or as a result of newly enacted legislation that would directly affect the price of a property. In the event of non-compliance by a member of the IHBA in relation to this aspect of the code, the IHBAmay take appropriate sanctions against that member.My Department plans to engage with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs during 2004 to consider a range of consumer issues related to housing including gazumping.

The basic maximum grant was increased in 1999 from €3,047, £2,400, to €3,810 and from €4,571, £3,600, to €5,720 for houses on specified offshore islands. The grants may meet two thirds of the approved cost of thatching works, subject to the maximum limits.The Department also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for which the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposed a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of €6,350 or €8,260 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, again subject to the maximum grant limits.A further grant in respect of the same dwelling can be paid where the works are commenced seven or more years from the date of payment of a previous grant.While there are no proposals, at this stage, to increase the rate of the grant or the frequency for which applications can be made for thatching grants, my Department will keep the terms of the scheme under review.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	882	My Department is in regular contact with local authorities on a range of housing issues. In so far as the issue of heating is concerned, my Department has recently been following up a survey undertaken in 2003 to establish the number of local authority dwellings without central heating facilities. A number of authorities have been contacted to establish the progress being made and details of the plans in place to provide central heating facilities in dwellings which lack them. A number of local authorities have put specific programmes in place to address this matter. In this context these programmes have been progressed by local authorities from their own resources and also with assistance from remedial works and area regeneration schemes funded by my Department.Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	883	I propose to take Questions Nos. 485 to 487, inclusive, together.European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires member states to achieve specified targets in relation to the recovery and recycling of packaging waste i.e. glass bottles and jars, cardboard boxes and containers, cans, plastic containers and wrapping, pallets etc. Under the directive, Ireland is required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005, with a minimum of 25% to be achieved by recycling, including a minimum 15% recycling rate for each type of packaging material. The 1994 packaging directive has recently been revised by a new amending directive which specifies higher recovery and recycling targets to be achieved by 2011 in the case of Ireland.The latest official data on packaging waste arisings and recovery are contained in the national waste database report for 2001 published by the Environmental Protection Agency in July 2003. The EPA estimates that 872,917 tonnes of packaging waste arose in 2001, of which 221,266 tonnes was recovered for recycling. This represents a recovery rate of 25.2%, thereby enabling Ireland to meet its 2001 25% EU packaging waste recovery target. In regard to glass packaging, the EPA estimates that 105,273 tonnes of glass packaging waste arose in 2001, of which 41,156 tonnes was recovered for recycling i.e. a glass recycling rate of 39.1%.With a view to facilitating the achievement by Ireland of the 50% packaging waste recovery target by end 2005 as specified in the 1994 packaging directive, new regulations entitled the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 were introduced last year. It is envisaged that these regulations will support the progress made by Repak, the compliance scheme set up by industry to ensure the recovery of packaging waste, by ensuring that all members of the business community — large or small, and including the licensed trade — play their part in meeting Ireland's packaging waste recovery targets. One of the principal features of the 2003 regulations is the introduction of a requirement on all producers participating in the placing of packaging on the market, i.e. manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — both Repak and non-Repak members — to segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises, back-door packaging waste, into specified waste streams i.e. waste paper, fibreboard, glass, aluminium, steel, plastic sheeting and wood, and have it collected by authorised recovery operators for recycling.The regulations further provide that such packaging waste may not be landfilled. Furthermore, the new regulations also clarify that packaging sold and consumed on a producer's premises comes within the scope of the regulations e.g. bottles sold and consumed in pubs, clubs and hotels. This mandatory obligation on producers to recycle packaging waste arising on their premises applies to all beverage containers sold on licensed premises, alcoholic and non-alcoholic. On foot of the introduction of this new requirement on producers, combined with the continued expansion of the bring bank network under the local and regional waste management plans, it is estimated that the glass recycling rate increased to over 60% in 2003. My Department was not involved in direct discussions with the organisations representing the licensed vintner trade in respect of the new regulations but they were directly notified of the new provisions.Further obligations are being placed on major producers i.e. producers who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the market in a calendar year and who have an annual turnover of more than €1 million. These include a requirement to provide segregated facilities for the take-back of packaging waste from the general public and to register with, and submit quarterly returns to, the local authority in whose functional area the major producers premises is located. Major producers can fulfil their obligations individually, or gain exemption from them by participating in an approved packaging waste compliance scheme i.e. Repak. Both options involve the payment of fees by major producers, largely related to the type and volume of packaging placed on the market.Enforcement of the packaging regulations is a matter for local authorities. In this regard, I have allocated €7 million to local authorities from the environment fund in 2004 for stepped-up enforcement of waste management legislation generally. Local authorities have been requested to give particular priority to enforcement of the new packaging regulations in their functional areas.

To facilitate further consideration of the preliminary report, the council has been requested to review and report to my Department on the water demand requirements of the villages included in the scheme, and their surrounding hinterlands. On receipt of the council's report, further consideration will be given to the preliminary report.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	885	Group sewerage scheme grants of up to 75% of the approved cost, subject to a maximum grant of €2,031 per house, are available for the provision of common or shared wastewater disposal systems.The national rural water monitoring committee is overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems. Twelve villages in six counties have been selected as locations for the pilot programme. Last year, proposals were invited from suitably qualified contractors to design and build these village schemes and to operate and maintain the infrastructure over a 20 year period. Contractors have now been shortlisted and construction is expected to commence later this year.Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the national rural water monitoring committee envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of such treatment systems. Confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the outcome of the pilot programme.

Neither is there such a proposal in the list of schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities in 2003 to prepare updated assessments of their water services infrastructural requirements.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	887	Motor tax for private cars is related to engine capacity rather than number of seats. A seven-seater vehicle with a lower engine capacity would therefore be liable for a lesser rate of motor tax than one with a higher engine capacity. It is not therefore proposed to review the basis of assessment for motor tax as proposed in the question.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	890	In January 2001 my Department approved Kildare County Council's application for funding under the serviced land initiative in respect of a proposed sewerage scheme at Rathangan. In October 2001 the council requested my Department to consider the proposal for funding as a major capital project under the water services investment programme.The scheme had been included, as a 2005 objective, in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in October 1999 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of subsequent phases of the water services investment programme. Because of the level of competing demand, and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.In 2003, local authorities were asked by my Department to provide updated assessments of their current water services infrastructural requirements. The Rathangan sewerage scheme has been placed fourth on the resulting priority list produced by Kildare County Council. The priority list will be taken into account in the selection of new schemes for approval in the next phase of the water services investment programme in due course.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	891	I propose to take Questions Nos. 495 and 496 together.The shared ownership scheme offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way. Initially, ownership is shared between the purchaser who buys at least 40% of the value of the house and the local authority from whom the purchaser rents the remaining share.The present maximum loan which a local authority may advance in respect of the purchased equity in a house is €130,000. Under the terms of the scheme, a loan of this amount can facilitate the purchase of houses at the level of average house prices nationally or above.It is a matter for local authorities, in operating the scheme, to determine the maximum house price limits having regard, inter alia, to the ability of applicants to meet the mortgage and rent commitments involved.My Department is keeping the terms of the income and loan limits under review, taking into account the movement in house prices, the effectiveness of various schemes in meeting the needs of the relevant target group and the availability of mortgage finance in the private sector. Work is continuing with representatives of the Irish Mortgage Council and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on the provision of finance by the lending institutions for affordable housing and other initiatives.

However, it would be the intention to implement the decentralisation arrangements in such a way as to minimise impact on and disruption to the Department's operations.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	894	My Department has participated in two previous decentralisation programmes. In 1983, the vehicle registration unit decentralised to Shannon, while under a later decentralisation programme in 1989, a number of sections moved to Ballina. There are currently 79 staff employed in Shannon and 89 in Ballina.The additional information sought is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.

The Department considers that such a survey will most valuably be undertaken when greater clarification on detailed arrangements is available following, inter alia, the report of the decentralisation implementation group.

All interested parties were invited to provide comments in writing within two months. The comments received will be considered initially by officials of the two Departments and consideration will be given to the extent to which the draft action programme might need to be revised on the basis of these comments.I will give consideration to the issues involved in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, having regard to the need to finalise the terms of the action programme at an early date and submit definitive proposals to the EU Commission. There have been informal contacts between officials of my Department and the Irish Farmers' Association and a submission dated 18 February 2004 has been received in my Department.

The Deputy should note, however, that the guidelines on the distribution of dormant accounts funding as set out in the dormant accounts plan will remain unchanged; and the purposes for which funding will be allocated will remain as specified in existing legislation.With regard to the forthcoming draft legislation, consistent with the Government's December 2003 decision, I can confirm for the Deputy that the following measures are proposed: a transparent application process; clear published evaluation criteria by which future applications will be assessed; and publication of lists of all successful projects and programmes.In addition, the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board will be given key roles, including preparation of future plans, advising annually on priority areas for disbursement and critically assessing the additionality and impact of the spend.In keeping with the principles of transparency, I anticipate the publication of annual recommendations by the Disbursement Board as to priority areas for funding.

I understand it has been decided by Údarás na Gaeltachta to continue funding for the course until June 2004.Reviews are carried out from time to time on projects undertaken by Údarás na Gaeltachta and its subsidiaries. In this context, Údarás has appointed a consultant to examine and review the work of the subsidiary company in question and an assessment of the course referred to by the Deputy will form part of that review. It is expected that specific recommendations will be made in regard to the continuation of the course in question, taking into account key factors such as the merits of the course, level of demand and future viability.

Strategies identified and mitigating any risks will be pursued, drawing on the resources of the departmental decentralisation committee and the experience of Departments which have decentralised functions in the past. My Department's membership of the central liaison committee will also assist in this regard.Timely intake of new staff and appropriate training provision will help to ensure that there will be no undue loss of expertise and knowledge in my Department arising from decentralisation.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	909	The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security of vulnerable older people.The scheme is advertised annually in the national and provincial papers. Applications are invited from locally based organisations to apply on behalf of the older people, that is, people aged 65 and over, in their area. The applications are received and assessed by my Department. Once the group has satisfied all criteria under the scheme, the group is approved up to 90% of the cost of their application.The local group applying under the scheme has responsibility for the purchase and installation of the security equipment. My Department has no involvement in this aspect of the funding.It is a matter for the local groups to seek quotes from various suppliers and to choose the security equipment that they consider best value. I do not consider that it would be appropriate for my Department to choose or promote one supplier over another.My Department is currently undertaking a review of the rules and guidelines of the scheme, prior to re-advertising it in May. The concerns expressed by the Deputy will be taken into account in the review process.

In addition to the minimum contribution each applicant is required to contribute towards his or her rent any additional assessable means that he or she may have over and above the appropriate rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance.The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that she submit an application form for rent supplement at the local health centre on 6 November 2003. She was asked to provide documentation relating to her financial circumstances so that an assessment of her means could be carried out. To date she has not provided the documentation sought and accordingly the board has advised that, at present, it is not in a position to determine the level, if any, of assistance payable in this particular case.The board has further advised that if the person in question supplies the outstanding documentation her application will be processed at the earliest opportunity.

Miners who are unable to work due to an incapacity arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive disability benefit subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for that payment.Miners may be entitled to disablement benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender. The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.Chronic emphysema and bronchitis and/or asthma, now known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, which have been contracted in the course of coal mining are not included in the list of occupational injuries prescribed diseases.The position in the UK is that their equivalent of our OIB may be paid to coal miners who have worked underground for at least 20 years and who are diagnosed as having definite pneumoconiosis with considerable lung function loss. The effect of prescribing COPD was not to confer entitlement to people who did not already qualify for the UK equivalent of OIB but rather, to enable a higher rate of payment to be made to some pneumoconiosis sufferers in certain circumstances.In Ireland, if COPD is present in cases where miners develop pneumoconiosis as a result of their occupation the disablement award will reflect this.

I understand there are no immediate plans to extend the ban on the sale of bituminous coal, so the question of extending the smokeless fuel allowance to other areas does not arise at present.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	916	The contribution conditions for unemployment benefit, UB, qualification that a person must have are at least 39 reckonable PRSI weekly contributions paid between the date of entry into insurable employment and the date the claim is made; and at least 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year, GCY, or at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding the GCY. The GCY is defined as the second last complete contribution year before the benefit year in which the claim is made. There is no requirement to pay 26 contributions every year in order to qualify for UB.As part of a number of measures announced at the time of the publication of the Estimates for 2004, from 5 April 2004, all new claims will require at least 52 paid contributions since the date of entry into insurable employment to qualify for unemployment benefit.Furthermore, provisions included in the 2004 Estimates for social welfare spending included the introduction of an upper limit of €300 on weekly earnings by a spouse, for entitlement to child dependant allowance in respect of all unemployment benefit claims.Child dependant allowance, CDA, is an additional weekly payment made to social welfare recipients, including those on unemployment benefit, in respect of each qualified child dependant. A full CDA rate of €16.80 is payable to recipients of unemployment or disability benefit together with a qualified adult allowance where the spouse's gross weekly earnings do not exceed €210.The new measure continues to provide for payment of half rate CDA where the gross income of the spouse exceeds €210 but for withdrawal of payment where it exceeds €300 per week. Prior to this, half rate CDA would have continued in payment regardless of the spouse's earnings.The practice of linking spousal earnings and the withdrawal of increases for dependants has been in place for a number of years in the form of a reduced qualified adult allowance and payment of half rate CDA. This new measure extends the practice by applying, for the first time, an upper income limit for receipt of CDA.It should be noted that the new measure will only take effect where there is a minimum family income equivalent to €22,600 or more per annum when the social welfare personal rate of €134.80 and earnings are combined. Where there is a non-earning or lower earning spouse, CDA entitlements remain unchanged.As the measure applied from 19 January, people already receiving half rate CDA on that date with a spouse earning more than €300 are not affected by this measure while they remain in continuous receipt of the existing payment. These measures are not expected to have a disproportionate impact on people in seasonal employment or in the fishing industry. It is estimated that the majority of claimants affected are those with a spouse or partner in full-time employment and earning considerably in excess of the €300 threshold. The measure enables available resources to be directed towards lower income families.

The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.The South Western Area Health Board was contacted and has advised that it has no record of an application for rent supplement from the person in question. If the person concerned wishes to make an application for rent supplement she should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre so that an assessment of her circumstances, including a means test, can be carried out to determine whether or not she is entitled to a rent supplement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	918	My Department provides three separate locall telephone contact numbers for the schemes and services available from our offices in Sligo, Longford and Letterkenny. The schemes in question are child and treatment benefits at 1890 400 400, maternity benefit at 1890 690 690 and pensions at 1890 500 000. The independent social welfare appeals office offers a locall service at 1890 74 74 34.Information material on all social welfare schemes and services, as well as application forms, may be requested via locall 1890 20 23 25 on a 24-hour, seven days a week basis or from the Department's website at www.welfare.ie.
Most customers of my Department can contact their nearest social welfare local office at local rates where their information needs will be met by a designated information officer.The question of access to other service via locall will be kept under review in the context of developments in service delivery generally and of the implementation of the Government's decentralisation programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	919	I propose to take Questions Nos. 525 and 527 together.Under the Government decentralisation programme announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, all sections of my Department currently located in Dublin will move to the following towns:TownPostsDrogheda300Buncrana120Donegal230Carrick-on-Shannon225Sligo100The Department's information services division will also be relocated, though the location has yet to be determined.In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency and Comhairle, agencies under the aegis of my Department, will be relocated to Monaghan and Carrickmacross respectively.A project management structure has been established within my Department to manage the decentralisation programme. The structure will support the two phases of the programme i.e. the development of an overall departmental strategy and the development and implementation of plans for decentralising individual sections.In developing the programme my Department will identify the risks associated with the decentralisation programme under various headings and will incorporate approaches to address these in the plans. In addition each business area will develop a project plan, part of which will involve a risk assessment and proposals to manage each category of risk.My Department has carried out a preliminary survey to establish levels of initial staff interest in transferring to decentralised locations. A total of 3,046 responses were received. Preliminary results are as set out in the attached chart at appendix A.While the survey provides a useful initial indication of staff preferences, it is recognised that the decisions which people will make are likely to change as the implementation of the programme proceeds.To date, staff surveys have not been carried out in the Combat Poverty Agency or in Comhairle.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Prelude	920	My Department currently has decentralised offices in Sligo, Letterkenny, Longford, Waterford and Dundalk. Some 319 staff responsible for the delivery of pension services were relocated from Dublin to Sligo in 1989. The number of staff serving in this office has now risen to 552 due to scheme changes and additional workload over the period. Of the original 319 staff involved, 31.6% were relocated from other areas of this department, 32.3% were redeployed from other Departments and 36.1% were recruited directly.In 1990-91 my Department decentralised its child benefit and treatment benefit office to Letterkenny. At that time a total of 176 staff were relocated. Due to increased claim loads the number of serving staff has risen to 190. Of the original 176 staff, 36.3% were relocated from within the Department, 23.9% were redeployed from other Departments and 39.8% were recruited directly.In 1993-94 my Department decentralised long-term illness schemes and other miscellaneous services to Longford. At that time a total of 178 staff were relocated. With an increased claim load there are currently 283 staff serving in this office. Of the original 178 staff who initially moved to this location, 52% were relocated from within the Department, 41% were redeployed from other Departments and 7% were recruited directly.In 1995 my Department decentralised part of its client data services to Waterford. At that time a total of 28 staff were relocated. Of these 68% were relocated from within the Department and 32% were redeployed from other Departments.In 2002 my Department decentralised its accounts branch to Dundalk. A total of 95 staff was relocated. Of these, 38% were relocated from within the Department, 47% were redeployed from other Departments and 15% were recruited directly.The number of job and people changes required to achieve decentralisation was significant in respect of each location. At a minimum, the filling of posts required two such changes and in some instances a higher number of changes were required.The additional costs to the Department arising in the context of decentralisation consists mainly of building fit-out costs, telecommunication equipment and staff related costs including training, overtime and travel and subsistence. The approximate total costs in the case of the locations above were as follows:LocationCost(million)Sligo£2.14Letterkenny£1.13Longford£1.13Waterford£0.04Dundalk€1.73
