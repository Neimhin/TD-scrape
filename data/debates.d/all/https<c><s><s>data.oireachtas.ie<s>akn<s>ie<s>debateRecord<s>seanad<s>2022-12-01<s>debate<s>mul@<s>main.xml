          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnMcGahon" eId="spk_4" as="#Acting_Chairperson">
            <from>Senator John McGahon<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_4">I am bringing this issue to the House today for a number of reasons, but the first key reason is that since this Government has come into office, as the Minister of State will know, there has been a very strong shift towards the use of public transport in so many guises and forms. The way we can encourage people onto more public transport is to provide the opportunities for them to use it in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> How do we do that? Let us look at Dunleer train station in County Louth, for example. Dunleer is the second biggest town in County Louth after Ardee in terms of a rural hinterland. It had a train station that closed in 1981. The other two train stations in County Louth are in the middle of Drogheda and the middle of Dundalk. Unless a person lives in either of those two urban areas, the concept of getting a train is just not open to them. It is physically impossible with traffic and everything else to either get into Drogheda in the morning, because of where the station is centred, or even into Dundalk at the same time. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> A year ago, during the county development plan process in County Louth, the National Transport Authority, NTA, poured cold water on the concept of opening a train station in Dunleer. It said it did not have the population. When one takes away the two populations of Dundalk and Drogheda, the population of the mid-Louth area is 25,000 people. However, it is not just that mid-Louth area; one has to take into consideration south Monaghan and the Kells-Slane-Nobber area of County Meath as well. It is a very substantial hinterland. The thing behind this is that, as I said, if we want to get more people off our motorways, out of cars and onto public transport, it is very difficult to do that when we are not providing them with various and a myriad of options. </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Where we have seen in Limerick, for example, the reopening of a railway with the Foynes-Limerick line, there is now a real opportunity to consider some of our disused and closed railway stations around the country. Alongside the national rail strategy, which is taking place, there should be a dedicated Government strategy or policy examining the concept of reopening disused railways. I am not talking about reopening disused railways in areas where they would be of no use. For example, in County Louth there was a very famous one that used to go out to Greenore and Omeath. Something such as that would not be feasible. However, Dunleer train station is right on the main Dublin to Belfast line. That whole part of the island of Ireland is part of the economic engine of the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">One other issue we have to consider is making sure it is not the case that people from outside the Dublin region are pouring into Dublin to go to work. This has to be able to show that we can provide jobs and economic opportunities in place like counties Louth or Wicklow or even in Newry and further afield in order that those people are then able to commute into our area, and that is not being sucked into a Dublin region. The concept of reopening Dunleer train station should strongly be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> I do not agree with the concept that the population is not there to do so. The population is set to grow dramatically by 2024. We want to expand the population of County Louth from 100,000 to 250,000 by 2050. At what stage, therefore, do we start to reopen railway lines? Do we just have to sit and wait for another ten years until the population grows further? If we provide the opportunities to increase public transport and get more people off our roads, reopening railway stations in particular areas such as Dunleer would be a good move. I am keen to hear the Government's views on that.</p>

          <speech by="#MalcolmNoonan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">I thank the Senator. I agree with everything he said with regard to the modal shift. Trying to move people out of private cars and onto public transport is a critically important policy from a climate perspective but also from a development and balanced regional development perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> As the Senator may be aware, the Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport, including rail. However, the operation, maintenance and renewal of the track network and stations on the network, including the former station at Dunleer, is a matter for Iarnród Éireann in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> The Senator may also be aware that Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits toward a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. The Minister for Transport believes that rail has a critical and crucial role to play in achieving change. It is vital that we address the constraints in the rail sector and deliver a network that allows rail to fulfill its potential in pursuit of decarbonisation priorities, rural connectivity objectives and as a generator of prosperity for people across Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> To this end, the Department of Transport co-commissioned an all-island strategic rail review, to which the Senator referred, with the Northern Irish Department for Infrastructure. The review will establish the strategic context for investment in rail across the island in the coming decades. Work on the review is at an advanced stage and a key consideration of the analysis is how the rail network can support regional and rural connectivity, encompassing service stopping patterns and the provision of stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> In addition to the strategic rail review, the eastern and midland regional spatial and economic strategy supports the continued development of the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor through targeted investment in transport infrastructure and services, recognising its importance as a link to the core European Union trans-European transport network, TEN-T. The complementarity between EU-level investment priorities and local services would need to be considered, however, as would the potential integration with any relevant local development plans. The reopening of Dunleer station is not currently included in the Louth county development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The delivery of any new rail infrastructure involves a multi-agency approach in the planning, design, funding and construction of a scheme. To protect the taxpayer, there are also guidelines and requirements in place surrounding the release of funds for capital infrastructure projects that must be adhered to by all agencies wishing to draw down public funds. These are set out under the public spending code drawn up by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Before Iarnród Éireann can receive public funding to proceed with any rail infrastructure scheme, the following conditions must be met: the proposal must be fully aligned with transport and planning policy; it must have a robust business case in line with the public spending code, as well as the transport-sector-specific common appraisal guidance; and a full demand assessment using the National Transport Authority’s regional modelling system is required as an input to the business case. The Minister for Transport is not aware of any current plans to reopen the station at Dunleer or to progress a business case. As noted, however, potential services and infrastructure along the existing and potential new rail lines are being considered as part of the strategic rail review.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The Minister has been assured by Iarnród Éireann that it will engage with any parties proposing station reopening projects such as Dunleer. Iarnród Éireann will ensure that no action is undertaken which would preclude any future reopening of the station. I hope that gives the Senator some assurance. A number of measures need to be addressed before a project like this can, excuse the pun, be brought back on track. It is important that it is reflected in the development plans as well and as I stated, that there is an aspiration and business case for such a project.</p>

            <from>Senator John McGahon<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">I thank the Minister of State very much. I see where he is coming from. This is an issue that has been talked about for 40 years. I did not come to the House today expecting to be told that Government is going to look at it. This has been an ongoing issue. This type of stuff with the regulations made sense before Covid-19. There has been a total sea change in Irish attitudes towards modal shift, however, particularly under this Government over the last two and a half years.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> This is a good example of how what Government plans to do and what it wants to do are actually at odds in officialdom. To me, this speaks of officialdom prior to the Covid era. People do not want to sit in their cars for two hours on the motorway into Dublin anymore. They want extra opportunities to take public transport. That is why we need some sort of particular strategy to be able to look at this and highlight the fact that if a person is coming from Dunleer, he or she does not want to have to drive to Dublin. People want accessible public transport. That is why we need to take a brand new approach and a new look at this. These types of regulations, while they are important, are very much a pre-Covid concept. New things should be considered when we have such a movement towards a modal shift in getting more people on public transport.</p>

            <from>Deputy Malcolm Noonan<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator in terms of the aspiration. A step-and-stage process has to be adhered to regardless of whether it is pre or post Covid. Certainly, there has been a sea change. The reduction in fares by 20%, and 50% for young people, has encouraged and put far more people back on to our public transport network. It is critically important that we as a Government respond to that and provide the infrastructure, facilities and funding in order that Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann can meet the demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> At present, there are no plans for the reopening of the station at Dunleer or to open a station in north Drogheda. Iarnród Éireann has assured the Minister for Transport that it will engage with any parties proposing such projects and will ensure that no action is undertaken that could preclude any future reopening of the station. That offers some assurance to the Senator that this is open for consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> As I said, a business case must be made for it. The Senator certainly put forward a very good argument this morning. The next stage lays with the local authorities, in particular. It is important to highlight it in this forum. It is critically important that we expand our rail network and expand the opportunities for people to use public transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting my Commencement matter. I acknowledge the correspondence I received last night from the office of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, apologising that he could not be here, for which I thank him, and telling me that alternative arrangements were being made. Subsequently, this Commencement matter was moved from third on the list to second, which may account for some of the confusion on how the Commencement matters are being taken. That is way beyond my brief, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for coming to the Chamber. He is always very welcome to the House. This matter proposes to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to provide equine keepers with access to his Department's animal identification movement scheme, IMM, which houses a central equine database allowing people to notify the Department directly when an equine moves residence to facilitate compliance with EU animal health law and the requirement for a record of habitual residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> This has been pursued many times in the Dáil by my colleagues, Deputies Fitzmaurice, Lowry and Canney.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">It is a discussion they have had on many occasions, and I support it. </p>
            <p eId="para_28"> In short, it is about the importance of information, data sharing and identification relating to the equine sector. It also concerns the importance of recording the details of ownership and history and ensuring that records can be viewed and submitted by equine keepers. We are getting smart, and IT and other technology is now very much part of the game. It is also about the live traceability of horses and more efficient processes for equine keepers to register and be compliant with the requirements set by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding records, movement and traceability of equines. Such records will also be valuable in cases of regional equine contagious diseases and outbreaks. </p>
            <p eId="para_29"> As I have said, this is all built around EU animal welfare law. I am keen to understand how it is progressing. Yesterday, we had the second national equine census in the country, for which 29,000 census forms and contacts were made. That is a significant undertaking. It is important for equine keepers to fully comply with the census. The move now is to embrace technology so the database can be accessed. I understand the Department is in favour of that and there may be questions around it. </p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Regarding the equine census, I want to acknowledge and thank the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a very comprehensive question and answer session which it pulled together and posted on its website. It was very helpful. Based on the outcome of the census yesterday, there will be a measure of how many people are engaging with the system. As we know, the equine sector is important to our economy. </p>
            <p eId="para_31"> We had a debate yesterday on funding for the Irish racehorsing industry. We have to do everything we can to support the Irish racing and breeding industries. Horses contribute significantly to the economy of Ireland, in particular the rural economy, be that sports, racing or breeding. Kilkenny is of particular importance. I want to do what I can to support the sector. I also want to make it easier for equine keepers to comply with the various EU laws and agricultural requirements.</p>

            <from>Deputy Malcolm Noonan<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">I welcome the young people to the Gallery. It is great to have them here. I probably saw them in the Dáil earlier. I am sure they are all looking forward to Santa. The countdown is well and truly on.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> In line with the commitment in the programme for Government to prioritise equine welfare through a robust traceability system, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine carried out the first equine census in November 2021. The 2022 equine census was held yesterday, Wednesday, 30 November. The primary objective of the census is to capture the habitual residence of every equine present on holdings across the country on census night - I am starting to sound like the nativity.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> All keepers will be able to access the equine census 2022 portal on <i>agfood.agriculture.gov.ie</i>. It will allow them to submit a census, including habitual residence of animals on a holding. It is important not to conflate habitual residence with ownership. As with other species, it is the keeper who may or may not be the owner of the equine and is responsible for the proper identification and treatment of that animal. The Department, therefore, relies primarily on updates by the keeper and change of ownership updates as a matter for the passport issuing organisation, PIO.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> As referenced by Senator Boyhan, the census is required in order to comply with the provisions of EU animal health law, EU regulation 2016/429, which requires that the Department records the details of the premises where all equines resident in the State are habitually kept. Unlike other farm species, equines move on a frequent, often daily, basis for training, exercise, breeding, racing, competition, shows, etc. It is recognised that real-time recording of their every movement is not feasible due to the frequency of movement of horses. Accordingly, the EU legislation regarding equine traceability is based on the creation of a link between the horse and residents where it is habitually kept.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The concept of a habitual residence is generally regarded as referring to the place where an equine has resided for a period of more than 30 days. By creating a link for the first time between each equine kept in the State on census day and the premises where it is kept, the census is the Department's first step in capturing the habitual residence of equines in the country. </p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The 12,500 census returns received last year have been converted into holding profiles in the Department's central equine database. As outlined, keepers will have access to the central equine database through the census portal, equine census 2022 on <i>agfood.agriculture.gov.ie</i> to which they can make a return. Those who submitted a 2021 census return will be presented with the information they submitted last year and can choose to access information and use it as a base for their return. This removes the need to re-enter the 15-digit passport numbers on equines that remain on the premises, information which is kept and recorded on the Department's system. Keepers keeping large numbers of equines, even where they are capped across a number of different premises, can choose a bulk upload option or submission of a spreadsheet on <i>agfood.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> While paper returns will be accepted for census 2022, the Department strongly encourages people to submit their 2022 census data online to through the dedicated census portal using their dedicated user name and PIN. I, along with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, encourage everyone keeping an equine to submit a census form. Census data provides valuable information for disease prevention, addressing public health concerns and dealing with lost, straying or stolen horses. There is extensive information on the Department's website for anyone with more questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> In more general terms, equine traceability continues to be enhanced. The system is centred on the equine database, which was established in May 2013. The database is part of the Department's annual identification movement. The database records and registered details on all equines issued with a passport by approved PIO, in Ireland. It also records the registration details of equines resident in the country issued with a passport by approved PIOs outside the Status.</p>

I thank the Department for taking the time to advise me yesterday that the Minister could not be here. It is a measure of attention to detail and focus by the Minister and Department.

It shows that the Department is dealing with the matter very well. It is an important area. As the Senator said, this is an important industry in Ireland, not just in my county but across the country. It is worth significant revenue to the Exchequer and is a significant employer. In that regard, the Department has been very considerate in ensuring that the equine database is kept up to speed and moves with technology.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I thank the Minister of State for being here today. As Senator Boyhan said, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue contacted me to say that he could not be here because he is launching an important climate action strategy. It is important that a member of the Green Party is taking this Commencement matter. I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine update the House on the actions of the Department to audit and calculate the current carbon sequestration of agricultural land and farm holdings.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> The Minister of State knows this issue is important. I have been talking about it for years and I am very frustrated by the lack of clarity. We have had crazy debates, some of which involved bullying, over the summer with regard to carbon budgets for agriculture. The narrative by some media and elected representatives around the conversation shows a level of misunderstanding by the majority of Irish agriculture and, as a result, often threatens and downgrades Irish agriculture. Such a narrative can be very difficult for farming families.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The agri sector people speak about is not an anonymous entity. Rather, it comprises the farm I grew up on which my family farms to this day and my neighbours. Many people struggle to make ends meet. While trying to keep farms going they are hearing that we need to cut emissions. They agree with that, but they feel taken advantage of because farm holdings big and small are the carbon sink of the nation and there is no acknowledgement by the State of this. Trees, grass, soil and even sheep's wool sequester carbon. Some 400,000 km of hedgerows across this country are carbon sinks and biodiversity havens. </p>
            <p eId="para_45">The lowly, common hawthorn can support more than 200 insect species. That alone is something that should be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> We are entering an era that could be an exciting time for farmers. We could be empowering our farmers and we could be giving them control in working towards net-zero agriculture. We could also be allowing them to send energy from solar panels back onto the grid. There are acres of roof space across the country, but for some bureaucratic lack of will they are denied the ability to do this. I passionately believe the science will back me up when I say that many of our farmers are actually farming at net zero.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> As the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is probably well aware, a private enterprise, an agri-tech company named Devenish, has launched the ground-breaking sustainable farming initiative which helps to decarbonise the global agricultural sector by supporting farmers to continue to produce nutritious meat and milk while dramatically improving their carbon balance. Knowing one’s carbon balance sheet will help one identify the actions that will help the wider agricultural sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond, boosting environmental credentials for producers and processors at every point along the food the chain. Accurately measuring on-farm carbon emissions and carbon sequestration will create a new value for farmers across the island of Ireland and will substantially accelerate the achievement of climate goals while improving biodiversity, water quality and overall farm resilience.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland is doing this on a voluntary basis on dairy farms. There are already many farms across the country that are undertaking this work through various initiatives, but they are doing mitigation in the dark. Knowledge is power, and it is vital that we empower this industry to understand the baselines and to drive improvements in its efforts to mitigate climate change.</p>

            <from>Deputy Malcolm Noonan<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_49">I thank the Senator for raising this important question. I highlight that it is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to prepare the reports on emissions and removals associated with land use activities on an annual basis to the EU and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. However, there are many projects, as the Senator said, and work that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is undertaking that will benefit the improved reporting of the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, inventory.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> In Ireland, due to a temperate climate and to the prevalence of sustainable farming and forestry practices, we are fortunate to have a wide range of high-quality soils with stable reserves of soil carbon. The many beneficial roles of soil carbon are well known. Soil carbon increases resistance to soil erosion, improves water retention and fertility while also acting as a reservoir for biodiversity. These are all essential ecosystem services that we rely on for our overall health and wellbeing. We are looking at the co-benefits of carbon, soil and water quality. Therefore, increasing the rate of atmospheric carbon sequestration on our mineral soils is a priority of the Minister and our Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for which accurate measurement will be important.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Towards this goal, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has provided funding for the formation of a nationwide network of best practice demonstration and research farms under the Teagasc SignPost programme. This network will allow farmers to view novel approaches to carbon sequestration activities such as multi-species swards, liming, clover incorporation and improved fertiliser management. It will involve accurate measurement and baseline setting to allow continuous monitoring and verification.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> However, carbon sequestration is only one small part of the overall approach. The reduction of soil-based emissions is important to deliver the reductions in the overall carbon balance and the Department has delivered several projects to address knowledge deficits in this area. The RePEAT project will help to accurately identify the extent of organic soils under agricultural management while investment in European innovation projects in the midlands will seek to develop a results-based agri-environmental model to reward farmers for implementing sustainable management practices on peat soils.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Recent investment in carbon flux monitoring infrastructure, located on a range of soil types and agricultural management systems throughout Ireland, will provide accurate measurements and scientific evidence for both farmers and policymakers on the climate beneficial results of improved on-farm management decisions. This proposal will comprise approximately 30 greenhouse gas flux towers across a range of soil types. The resulting national agricultural soil carbon observatory will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Teagasc will shortly complete a research project called “farm carbon”, which provides a deeper understanding of hedgerows as carbon stocks - I know the Senator referenced this - in agricultural landscapes and will allow researchers to identify approaches to maintain and enhance this contribution. In addition, the soil sampling programme aims to establish a comprehensive national baseline on the soil organic matter, nutrient and soil pathogen status of our soils across all farming systems and geographic areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> As the Senator will appreciate, the knowledge gained from research and technological infrastructure establishment activities pursued through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will not only demonstrate the continued viability of our agrifood sector but it will also allow for the refinement of our reporting to the national inventory further emphasising the sustainability of the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Our Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, work in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine around some of these projects, particularly on carbon-rich soils and peatlands.</p>

            <from>Senator Erin McGreehan<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_57">I agree with the Minister of State that much work has been done. I will go back to my point that farmers still have no baseline and they do not know what they are doing on the farms. I will stress that knowledge is power. If the McGreehan farm knew what tit was putting out, then it could reduce and understand what it needed to do best. It could buy into that and could work with the Department on the soil and hedgerows. It could add to it while understanding what it is that it needs to do because at the moment farmers are in the dark on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The Minister of State also said that the calculations are the responsibility of the EPA but the EPA is a State body. I would urge the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, as well as the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which has a responsibility in this area too, and the EPA to work together to work to make sure farmers know what they are emitting, what they are sequestering and what they have to do to reduce that balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">I take on board all the points the Senator is making. Certainly, the research is ongoing and establishing baselines is critically important. As I said in my opening remarks, that work is very much being addressed. There are other issues I think are of value, such as looking at the value of semi-natural grasslands which, in many cases, I do not think have been given enough consideration. We have lost quite an amount of our semi-natural grasslands over the past 20 to 30 years. We are losing hedgerows at an alarming rate and, in many cases, they are poorly maintained. They are being overly manicured. They have a significant role to play, and I would like to see benefits accrue from that, from the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, and from other measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> A nature restoration law is to come from the European Commission. We are developing an Irish Government position on that, which will have co-benefits for water, carbon and biodiversity. In the few seconds I have remaining I will say that the last thing that we want to do is to scapegoat farmers for this. It is critically important that we work in partnership with the farming sector. We think there is a valuable partnership to be had and that there is a great opportunity for farming to be centrally involved in this massive transformation that needs to take place.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is more than welcome. I appreciate her attendance her. This morning I raise the significant issue that has emerged with CoAction in west Cork in the last ten days. I know the Minister of State's office has been made aware of it. This is the significant issue in terms of what is happening to the services CoAction provides locally in west Cork. It pertains to the plans for Bayview House, which is to be renovated, and how that is to be moved forward. The proposal, which has been brought forward, is that it will use the child and family centre, which is a purpose-built family centre that cost €1.3 million, the majority of which was fundraised locally, on a permanent basis. The residents of Bayview House will be relocated to that site on a permanent basis. It has created a ferocious furore in west Cork, and rightly so. People depend on the services that are provided in this wonderful complex on a daily basis. They fundraised for it and it is a part of their community. It is a purpose-built building that cost €1.3 million and now it going to be renovated so that it can be changed for another use. That will cost another considerable sum of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> There is a knock-on implication. There are several complexes, including two buildings in Castletownbere, which are idle at the moment. They can be part of the solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> There is great disappointment with the communication between the CEO and board of CoAction and the residents. We have had a week of no information. The only significant information the residents got was from a Gaeltacht programme yesterday which featured the CEO and a patron of the services. That created a ferocious furore because there are users who are Irish speakers, but some are not. They find it hard to get the information back and have it translated. There are major issues with communication. The board and CEO of CoAction need to communicate with patrons of the service. That communication has not happened in the past ten days. An AGM to which I was not invited was held in Skibbereen last week. The information came out before and during the AGM. We learned of the knock-on implications a week later but there has been no communication from the board. We need clarity. The Minister of State knows better than I do that parents whose children need these services are to the pin of their collar. Any change in services is a huge issue for them. The lack of interaction and understanding and the failure to provide the support they require feed the rumour mill. For this reason, people in west Cork do not have clarity about the next step. </p>
            <p eId="para_64"> I am delighted the Minister of State came on short notice to the Chamber to discuss this issue. I am aware there are several people watching because it is such a significant issue. The Minister of State's party colleague, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, has been very strong on this issue. As a Government, we have been doing our best to provide these services but we need information and clarity. The Minister of State's intervention this morning is very much welcomed.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I thank the Senator for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to provide an update on it. I am told this morning that the proposal to repurpose CoAction child and family centre in Bantry into a residential for adults is in response to several recent HIQA reports which highlighted unsuitable premises at the Bayview-Seskin residential unit. In light of this, the HSE requested that CoAction review properties for rent or sale in Bantry and the wider area as an alternative to repurposing the existing administration building. The HSE also maintained contact with CoAction with regard to existing HSE buildings in the area. The HSE has stated that it is advised that appropriate housing stock in the area continues to be extremely limited. Timelines involved in bringing potential properties to a standard that will meet appropriate regulations are also a consideration given the pressing nature for placing of residents in safe and appropriate accommodation. I am advised that the completion of the residential unit refit in Bayview, when coupled with the repurposing of the administration building, will keep vital residential services in the area and create an additional capacity of up to six residential overnight respite placements.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> While I appreciate the pressure CoAction may be under, I do not agree with the removal of children's services from their current location. I cannot be clearer. I have seen the building, and it is an impressive asset to have. I understand great upset was aired by families at CoAction's AGM last week and I can entirely see why this has left families upset, concerned, frustrated and taking to social media with their children to tell their stories and outline why they need to retain this service. While I compliment CoAction on an excellent, efficient service in children's teams, the removal of that and the weaponising of children to lobby to keep a service is wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> I will share something that is still in draft mode. I have the progressing disability services, PDS, roadmap in front of me. It states that, as an example, the CDNT team in west Cork, which was established in 2013, reported no vacancies in October 2021 and, at the end of August 2022, had no child waiting longer than three months for an initial contact. When I first received that information, I asked if we could check it with the HSE and also check the parliamentary questions to make sure it was accurate. Within a week, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan told me what is unfolding in Deputy Lombard's area. I again make clear that there can and will be no closure of children's services. I will work with the HSE and CoAction to ensure children's services remain in place while we address HIQA concerns at Bayview and undertake repurposing to ensure the users have the best purpose-built building, but not at the expense of the children.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">I thank the Minister of State for her passionate and powerful response. For the families affected by this issue, particularly in the past ten days, it has been upsetting to say the least. I have been understated in the terminology I am using about the implications of what has happened and how it has knocked confidence in system. It would be wonderful if the Minister of State could find time in her diary to meet the parents in question. They are a wonderful group of people. They are passionate and courageous and are doing their utmost to make sure their families and children are protected. If the Minister of State could find time in her diary to meet them, it would be a wonderful gesture. Her statement gives us great hope that there will be no change to the service or the location. That is what the general public and these parents are fighting hard for and want for their families. I thank the Minister of State for coming at short notice. I deeply appreciate her statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_71"> Let us be clear about this. Recently, the HSE informed me that the work CoAction is doing in west Cork under PDS is one of the better examples around the country. I struggle to find good, so is it not great to find it in west Cork? Is it not great that I can point to it and say that is what good looks like? If someone is thinking of putting that at risk, it will not be on my watch. I need to have good because I struggle to find good in the 91 teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I am delighted the Senator brought up the issue in Castletownbere, where we have properties standing idle.

          <p eId="para_76">Before I call on the Leader of the House to outline the Order of Business, I welcome not only Romania's ambassador to Ireland, but also Ireland's ambassador to Romania. They are here to celebrate Romania's national day. Some 104 years ago the national assembly proclaimed the unification of the Romanian people. A long struggle for independence is just one of the many common bonds that unites Ireland and the people of Romania.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Every year on the first day of December, we celebrate the unity of the Romanian people. Living divided under three empires Romania struggled for centuries for liberty, independence and unity. The unification began with the regions of Wallachia and Moldavia in January 1859, and was completed on 1 December 1918 when Transylvania joined with other Romanian regions following a plebiscite. In a powerful symbol of unity, the Romanian King Ferdinand and his wife Marie were crowned in 1922 in the same city where he national assembly met. Of course, it was also the year the Irish Free State was founded. As proud and active members of both the European Union and the United Nations, Romania and Ireland work together in a rules-based international order for rights and sovereignties to be decided by themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Of the 120,000 people currently living in Ireland, many have been here between 15 and 20 years. Many are now going home to bring skills learned here back to their native country. They follow in the footsteps of Josef Cretzan who made his way to Waterford Crystal and helped make it internationally famous. He was born in the city of Putna in northern Romania, but in 1951 after years of wandering around war-torn Europe he made his way to Ireland and got a job in Waterford Glass, examples of which adorn our Seanad Chamber. Of course the father of a former Senator, now Deputy Ivana Bacik, was also one of those who helped to establish Waterford Crystal as a global brand.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> We would like to thank both ambassadors for coming today and we wish them a happy independence day. I would also like to wish Ilinca Popa, who works in our Seanad office, a happy independence day. The ambassadors are most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> I am going to hand over to the convenor of the friendship group, who will be very brief. It is very unusual to do this but, as it is the national day, he will take over for a few minutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">I do not think this has been done before. It is possibly a reflection on the Cathaoirleach and the Chamber's reaction to, and celebration of, Romania's national day. The Cathaoirleach outlined very clearly some of Romania's struggles for independence and so on. It is absolutely fantastic that not only do we have the Romanian ambassador to Ireland, Laureniu-Mihai Ştefan, here with his team, we also have the Irish ambassador to Romania who has travelled from Romania for the celebration of the Romanian national day in Ireland. They are both very welcome to the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> There are an estimated 120,000 Romanians living in Ireland who have established their lives here, and work right across many different industries such as manufacturing, technology and services like retail and hospitality. We are delighted they are here. They are providing valuable diversity to our communities and performing many important tasks and skills in our workforce. We wish them and their families a very happy national day. The ambassadors and their teams are both very welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I welcome the approval by the Cabinet of the agricultural and food supply chain Bill 2022, which is now ready to be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas. When this important Bill is enacted, it will establish a new independent statutory authority to be known as an rialtóir agraibhia, or the agrifood regulator. The legislation is being progressed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue. I am delighted that the Minister and the Government have approved this Bill. It fulfils a programme for Government commitment to ensure fairness, equity and transparency in the food chain by establishing a new authority. I do not believe there is anybody within the confines of the House today who does not realise that for many years there have been issues in respect of a fair price for produce for many people in the agricultural industry, particularly small suppliers. The agrifood regulator will be empowered with real teeth and will be a strong advocate for farmers, fishers and all food producers. It will shine a light on the sector to help to improve the position of the primary producer and will also bring greater transparency and fairness. The regulator will promote and enforce the principle of fairness and transparency for the agrifood business, in particular. The regulator's price and market analysis and reporting function will bring greater transparency to the sector in general. The Bill provides that the new office will be led by a board and will have a CEO. The competition to appoint a CEO is well progressed at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The unfair trading practices, UTP, directive is currently enforced by the interim UTP enforcement authority in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The enabling provisions in the agricultural and food supply chain Bill 2022 provide for the transfer of responsibility for UTP enforcement functions to the remit of a new regulator. This is crucially important. I understand that the Minister and the Government will not be hanging around in respect of this issue. It is long overdue. As I said, it was a commitment in the programme for Government. It is now going to happen fairly rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> Payments to 71,000 farmers under the 2022 fodder scheme have just commenced and are under way. These small payments range from a couple of hundred euro up to €1,000. This scheme was brought in by the Minister and the Government last year, and 71,000 farmers are benefiting from it. The important point is that the Government will be running the scheme again next year. I remind all in the farming community who qualify that they have until midnight on 5 December to make their applications.</p>

          <p eId="para_93"> I have raised inland fisheries matters on numerous occasions. I am grateful for the reply I received this morning from the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, informing me that an investigation will take place on matters under the Department’s protected disclosures policy. The contents of the emails, together with the information and attachments I have provided, will be furnished to the investigator. I welcome that because I have raised these matters on numerous occasions, as have colleagues in this House and the other Chamber from the locality. </p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Quite extraordinarily, there was a great deal of very important material in the report that was published by Conleth Bradley. In sections 87 and 88 of the report, Mr. Bradley makes recommendations on how communications to the board should be considered and what should or should not be put before members of the board. Mr. Bradley recommends that all communications from the Department’s stakeholders or third parties should be forwarded to the CEO and board secretary for vetting, and that they and they alone should decide what should be brought to the attention of board members. The CEO is hired by the board and works for it to implement board decisions. The chair runs the board and the CEO manages the day-to-day functions of the organisation. If the recommendations are accepted, they will amount to sort of a coup or takeover of the board by its employee, the CEO. Any future CEO could shield himself or herself from any adverse communications from external parties and essentially censor all incoming external communications. It seems that the chair’s role would be reduced to conducting board meetings and dealing with the agenda devised by the CEO and the board’s secretary. If this type of standing order is adopted by Inland Fisheries Ireland, it will amount to a suspension of the independence of the chair and the board, and the handing of the keys to the board’s employee and agent, the CEO. The board must be allowed to exercise its oversight functions without hindrance. I call again for a debate on matters in respect of Inland Fisheries Ireland and angling in general in this country. Given the work programme we have ahead of us now, I expect that this debate will not happen until the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I am indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Saturday, 3 December is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I ask all Members, when they are at their parliamentary party meetings, to press upon their leaders to commit to ratifying all the protocols, including the optional protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, next year. In any event, it must happen during the term of this Government, which hopefully will last longer than that. Sadly, and for shame, Ireland remains one of the worst places in the EU to have a disability on every measure, including social isolation, poverty, homelessness, suboptimal medical outcomes and lack of services and therapies. One of the reasons for this is that Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the EU that does not have a legislative requirement or a basis in law which obliges the Government or its agents to provide treatments, therapies and services to persons with disabilities. We have an obligation now to have an assessment of need, and I welcome it, but once that assessment of need is provided, nothing follows.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> The other manner in which we are outliers is that we are the only country in the EU which does not have a legislative requirement for the state or its agents - the HSE, for example - to provide carers to people with disabilities, to the elderly or to parents, or to provide any respite or personal assistant hours. Ratification of the UN convention and its optional protocol would remedy that immediately. In the absence of that, I hope to introduce legislation at some point during the lifetime of this Government to rectify and address those issues. In the meantime, I ask for a debate to bring all of us together. It may have to be a Private Members' debate. Individually, every single Member of both Houses I have spoken to is in favour of ratification but collectively, for some reason, the Government is slow to do this. There is goodwill there. It is right the thing to do. I ask Senators collectively to progress this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">The Leader of the House probably will know what I will raise under the Order of Business, and that is the fact that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, wants to introduce the planning and development and foreshore Bill in the Seanad next week. The general scheme is still undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas housing committee, which is only due to complete it next week. I do not think we have ever come across a case such as this before, where we have a Minister who is seeking to gazump a committee undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny. What is more shocking is that contrary to what he stated in his letter to the Leader this week, he has not engaged or consulted with the Oireachtas housing committee on this move. His letter is deliberately misleading. It is an appalling way to treat the House, the Leader and the Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> This Bill is controversial. It is being criticised by a range of stakeholders. It goes to the core of planning and environmental protection. I acknowledge that the Leader tried to work with the Minister on this. I think originally the proposal was to do it all in one sitting and I know now the Bill will be taken over two days next week, rather than a single sitting as requested by the Minister. However, that is enough. This Bill is so significant and due to the fact that pre-legislative scrutiny has not been completed, it would require weeks for both of the Houses to give this Bill the due process that is required. I appreciate the Leader’s efforts to schedule it over the two days but it is not good enough. </p>
          <p eId="para_104"> We will, as a group, oppose the Order of Business next Tuesday. We call on any Member who believes in environmental protection and the planning process to stand with us and send a clear message to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, that he needs to respect the committees, the way the committees conduct their business, this House and the Leader’s position. At the moment, that is not what he is doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">I just want to congratulate Al-Haq, Palestine’s premier human rights organisation, for the launch of its new report entitled Israeli Apartheid. It truly is an expansive and rigorous piece of research. Some of its authors are legal academics from National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG. It is the latest in a series of reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and B’Tselem, which have found that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. Unfortunately, the Irish Government has so far refused to recognise this fact, which is very disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Yesterday, I was very happy to be part of the launch of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Campaign for Palestine, which is a new civil society coalition. There are 16 groups that signed up for this so far, including trade unions, such as SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, development charities, such as Trócaire, human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and, of course, Sadaka and the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, IPSC. It is a broad coalition representing an incredible array of activists, researchers and campaigners who are comping together with the aim of asking the Government to recognise that the state of Israel is committing crimes of apartheid against the Palestinian people. </p>
          <p eId="para_110"> We are calling on the Government also to support efforts at the United Nations led by South Africa and Namibia to re-establish the special committee against apartheid to investigate all practices of systemic discrimination and oppression purportedly amounting to apartheid anywhere in the world, including the occupied Palestinian territory. The South Africans and Namibians know apartheid first-hand. They struggled against it and defeated it. </p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Ireland now needs to do its part. We are also calling for the passage and enactment of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, which I introduced to the Seanad four years ago. I echo the wonderful article that was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday by the former chair of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, namely, Fatin Al Tamimi, by saying that Ireland needs to do more. Palestinians need deeds, not words. Mere condemnation of Israel’s crimes is just hallow rhetoric; it needs to be backed up by action. The constant cycle of condemnation and inaction relating to Israel undermines Ireland’s credibility and degrades its commitment to upholding international law. Irish people understand what it is happening in Palestine. There is a powerful anticolonial instinct and a natural solidarity between us and the Palestinians. </p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Unfortunately, the Government is lagging behind. It is denying a reality that is experienced by millions of Palestinians. It is out of step with Irish public opinion and it is a job of activists and campaigners to remind them of that. Ireland has an opportunity to lead the global struggle against apartheid and we need to seize it with both hands. We owe it to the Palestinians, ourselves, our past and our future – a future free from apartheid, colonialism and war.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I would like a debate on the issue. I know we probably will not get it this side of Christmas, but I would also love, if we have a debate, for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in and give us an update on what is happening.</p>

          <from>Senator Marie Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_114">I want to raise the issue of the closure of the Mater hospital long Covid clinic that is due to take place this month. The closure of this important clinic will deprive communities of the north inner city and across the north side of Dublin of a vital service for those who are unlucky to develop those enduring symptoms from Covid-19. Those symptoms can be debilitating both physically and mentally. It is important to say that under the stewardship of Professor Jack Lambert and other doctors in the Mater hospital, it was to the fore in treating the first patients of Covid, conducting research in this country on Covid and the issues associated with long Covid and in recognising that long Covid is predominantly a neurorehabilitation issue. It is shocking that the HSE has decided to overlook the hospital in funding the continuation of the long Covid clinic in that hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Serious questions need to be raised about the HSE’s model of care towards long Covid and how that is being deployed across the country. There have been eight post-acute Covid clinics identified across hospitals and six long Covid clinics. Yet, we know from clinicians in the Mater hospital, in particular, that the demand is not for post-acute Covid care in the immediate weeks after suffering Covid, rather, it is for long Covid. Yet, we are seeing significant resources being put into post-acute Covid care, when really they needs to be put into long Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> The other thing is with regard to what exactly is being put into long Covid. There is only one consultant neurologist to be recruited and appointed across the six long Covid centres. That raises serious questions about the understanding within the HSE of how, precisely, to treat long Covid. While we understand that cardiac and respiratory symptoms are the main symptoms exhibited by long Covid sufferers, at the heart of this, the underlying cause of it is a neurological issue. Up to 16,000 people in this country are affected by long Covid. Those symptoms can endure for up to two years or more. We need to get that service in proper order in this country. Some people are waiting months for care and yet, in the Mater hospital, people were seen promptly. It is simply appalling that there is now no service for the north side of Dublin, up as far as the boundary with Beaumont. There are serious questions for the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Finally, there is a broader call for neurocognitive or neurorehabilitation care. We see two pilots in place at the moment. We all received the emails about it. We need to see long Covid care included along with acquired brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s. </p>
          <p eId="para_118">It is now urgent that we roll out new rehabilitative centres across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I raise a positive issue that I, along with a Fianna Fáil councillor, Councillor Teresa Costello, have been working on. This time last year the national screening advisory committee put out open calls for extra checks. It highlighted a number of issues where one could make a submission to ask for things to be changed. Councillor Costello and I worked together on a proposal for an extension of the age eligibility for BreastCheck. Thankfully, we both received the positive news that the national screening advisory committee has recommended to the Department of Health that it widen the age range eligibility for the BreastCheck programme from 45 years of age to 74 years of age. That is an extra ten years of BreastCheck.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> It also recommend the introduction of a standardised breast density notification for all participants. That is a really important step and I am sure that if the independent body of the national screening advisory committee recommends such an important thing to the Department of Health, it will follow it through and do it. This will also be on the foot of an upcoming European Council proposal. It is not often that I get to raise a really positive thing in this Chamber. This is for the health of all people in Ireland, as well as for people who are losing family members. Up to 700 people in this country die every year from breast cancer. This is a very positive thing in terms of prevention and looking after and caring for everybody in this country.</p>

I am delighted to welcome one of our distinguished alumni, a former Senator, who is now a Deputy of much standing and great repute, Deputy O’Dowd, and his guests to the Visitors Gallery. They are very welcome and it is lovely to have them here. They happen to be geographic neighbours of mine, but Deputy O’Dowd will point that out later. It is a particular pleasure to welcome them.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> It is also my great pleasure, and this is very significant, to welcome Gurteen Central National School. The principal there is Seamus Walsh, but there are two very interesting things from our point of view here. The grandniece of Senator Craughwell, Evie Cunniffe, is one of the teachers there as is his niece, Donna Broderick. It is certainly in the DNA of the Craughwells, who have been teachers for many a day. Senator Craughwell was president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI. I am delighted to welcome the pupils, the teachers and the principal, who is with them. It is great to have them here along with the other guests.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Like the previous speaker, I would like to acknowledge some good news. We often stand up here and we criticise and say things are not good enough. However, over the last five years, I have been raising the case of Bandon Grammar School and its inability to access funding from the Department of Education for a special class for autism. There is an issue regarding the ability of fee-paying schools to access this funding. This has meant that for the last decade, in particular, Bandon Grammar School could only provide services through its own means as it got no support from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> I am delighted to report that in the last week there has been a significant move here. It is the first fee-paying school outside of Dublin that has now gotten funding for a special class and that is really important. The special classes are an important part of our school ethos now. The idea of having special classrooms has resulted in a holistic approach to education. It was appalling that a school the size of Bandon Grammar School was not getting funding for that for the last decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I compliment, in particular, the principal and the former principal as well as the trustees who have waived all fees pertaining to this. It is now open to the entire community and anyone and everyone has the opportunity to apply for those places. It is a significant development for that community. I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in particular. She visited the school with me on occasion and she and her Department worked with me to remove this barrier, so that now we have the opportunity to have special classes in every school that wants to have them.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I rise to bring awareness to the report on autism published by Senator Carrigy and his committee today. I pay compliments to all the Members who sat on the committee, as well as the people who contributed to the report and its findings. I would like to highlight some of the key findings, which are the asks of the committee. I would like to put pressure on so that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will consider them. I pay compliment to her because she has done so much work in this area, but we have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The main findings are that we should ensure that all autistic children will have access to the summer programme in 2023 and that we ensure that all special schools will provide the summer programme in 2023. I know of many schools that do not currently provide it. We should provide sufficient resources to schools so that they may offer comprehensive programmes to the summer programme in 2023 and liaise with the various stakeholders. I know many of the stakeholders contributed to this report. We should mitigate any constraints to the provision of the summer programme, including in the areas of staffing and pay issues; that we should broaden the potential workforce; and that we should mitigate any difficulties with Garda vetting. These were some issues some schools came up against. They could not get people through the Garda vetting process in time, or the resources were not there to run the programme. There were so many children with disabilities who did not qualify to participate in the programme. I have spoken to parents and I know some parents in my area are very involved in it. The positivity the children received from the programme is to be commended. It should be rolled out for all children with disabilities and for those with autism, in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">The Leas-Chathaoirleach welcomed the children of Gurteen Central National School from east Galway. These are fifth and sixth class pupils in the school. This epitomises what goes on in Irish education. This is a small, rural school where kids are being looked after, educated and brought through the system. We sometimes do not give our national schools enough credit for the amount of work they do. The principal is here today and he will not be home until late tonight. Again, people do not recognise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> One of the key issues, and Leas-Chathaoirleach and I have spoken on this, is the shortage of teachers in our country. Panels are not being filled. Special needs teachers - and this is a real bugbear of mine - are being taken out of their special needs roles and are being put in to teach mainstream classes. This goes back to my time in further education. What is happening is the special needs child is being left aside. Senator Clonan spoke on this issue last week. Families have to go to the courts to get an education for their children. That is all fine and dandy for the families who can afford that, but it is not good enough for those who cannot. We should cherish our children an awful lot more.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> It is a great source of pride for me to have the kids here from Gurteen Central National School. This is a great day for them, because they know that this House is their House, and not our House. They have as much access to anybody in this House as any other citizen of the State. I am grateful the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all of my colleagues gave them that welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_136"> Saturday is the European Day of Persons with Disabilities. It is a day when Europe reflects on the value and contributions people with disabilities make to European society, as well as the challenges and difficulties that are there. This week in Brussels, there was a high-level conference on the issue of employment of people with disabilities. This country does not perform well when it comes to employing people with disabilities. Among blind and visually impaired people, 85% are unemployed, meaning only 15% are in meaningful, gainful employment. There is no excuse for that. They have the same intelligence levels as everybody else but the problem is that the structures, supports, facilities and services are not in place. Digital accessibility is at a low level in this country and the necessary supports and equipment are not really available or provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> At some stage in the new year, we should have a debate on the employment of people with disabilities. Many good things are happening in this country and many organisations do good things but, overall, we are not performing at the level we should be. I will be proposing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I hope all persons with disabilities have a reflective and enjoyable European Day for Persons with Disabilities. It is an opportunity to mark our successes. We have the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Much of it is ratified here but it is not fully ratified. That is work that needs to be done by the Government. It is important that we acknowledge the phenomenal contribution that persons with disabilities make to our society and country.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I commend Senator Carrigy and the autism committee on their work on the interim report on summer provision. It is an excellent report which sets out the ambitions we need to have in relation to supporting families with consistent summer provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> There was an article today in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>about fire safety defects in the phase 1 Phoenix Park Racecourse apartments, which were completed around 2008. They join about 90,000 or 100,00 other apartments and duplexes affected by fire safety, water ingress and structural issues. These families face pressure, uncertainty, fear and financial insecurity about how they will look after the basic need for safety in their own homes. We need to see the proposals committed to by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on this. The working group put its report to the Government in July. It is an excellent report but we need to see what options are there to support these families. You read things like a developer is not liable because the defects are over seven years old. The developer is still building Phoenix Park Racecourse and it will have over 200 homes. Those proposals have to be retrospective because people and families cannot wait any more for financial supports.</p>

          <p eId="para_143"> We have heard supports for radio announced this morning, particularly for regional independent radio stations. All of us in rural areas know how important that is. Particularly for me, Galway Bay and Shannonside radio stations are companions for many people in our rural areas and they have been struggling. I have spoken with personnel from those stations. They will always have advertising from State agencies but local advertising is down 30% and has not recovered since Covid. It has been a huge issue. I am grateful our parties in government have worked together to support those regional independent stations. I thank businesses who advertise on radio. Radio reaches all audiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> I highlight World AIDS Day and the particular impact in Ukraine. It is important to recognise that the flag flies high for the Ukraine in Ireland.

          <p eId="para_157">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I think my reaction to what Senator McGahon has said probably says a lot about how we all feel. I had not heard that story. I am shocked, but, in another way, not shocked at all. My husband is a cyclist and cycles to and from work, from where we live into town, which is a decent journey.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">He has a camera on both the front and back of his bike simply because it is not safe and he needs the evidence to be able to go to the gardaí should something actually happen to him. It happens at least once per month. The problem is that the gardaí are very helpful insofar as that they will take the case, but cases are never brought forward because there are insufficient laws in this country for how motorists are dealt with in respect of near misses or disrespect for other road users. I am always mindful of how we treat each other on the road. People in cars sometimes think that what happens outside of the car is not anything to do with them. Yet, I am really conscious that people in cars treat children on bikes much differently than they do adults, and enormously differently from how the treat people in Lycra on bikes on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Until we have a serious conversation about how we respect each other and about the size and differences in the vehicles we use, be they buses, cars or bicycles, and pedestrians, we will continuously have issues like the one raised by Senator McGahon this morning. If what he said is true, however, it brings having an accident to whole different level or perhaps it is just that people do not have regard for the size of their vehicles. I will certainly try to organise a debate after Christmas. I am genuinely shocked by what the Senator raised this morning.</p>

Indeed, our colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, raises that particular issue week in, week out in this Chamber. It is very important that we respond as a State with a scheme similar to those for pyrite and mica for those residents who have no other means of supporting themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Senators Conway and Clonan this morning raised the fact that Saturday is both European and International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I am very mindful that we use reports and assessments as a tool to prolong action. It is terribly frustrating. The time for assessing should be very close to being over and the time for action should start; not for talking about the assessments, which is what we do in this country. It is very obvious to us what needs to be done. Senator Clonan's suggestion that we continue to put pressure on all our party leaders is very welcome. I will certainly do my part with mine. I commend Senator Conway for also raising that issue this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Senator Craughwell welcomed pupils from Gurteen Central National School. On a more serious note, however, he highlighted the very serious issue we have in this country of a serious lack of teachers both in primary and post-primary schools. Panels are not being filled. As the Senator suggested this morning, some of our special needs teachers are being used to fill gaps in schools and that really is not what we want. We need to be very confident about a recruitment drive for teachers. One thing might be to reduce the H.Dip. from two years back to one year. It was increased a number of years ago because we had an oversupply of teachers and now we absolutely have an undersupply of teachers. It might be worth bringing that two-year course back to one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senator Maria Byrne raised the autism report this morning. I say fair play to our colleague, Senator Carrigy, and all the members of that committee, which has done an enormous body of work in a very short space of time. Hopefully, the recommendations will be taken on board. I understand there is a lack of teachers and maybe that is one of the reasons why summer programmes are not offered in certain towns and villages. We all want the same thing, which is continuity of education for our children with special needs. I welcome that report. We will have a debate on it after Christmas so that we can talk further about the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Senator Lombard this morning welcomed the funding for a special class in Bandon Grammar School.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator Sherlock spoke about an issue that was raised in this Chamber on Tuesday. I was really dismayed to see Dr. Jack Lambert having to plead for money on Twitter at the weekend. It is very unedifying for a man of his stature. Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue the other day in the context of there being no long Covid clinic in Limerick, and that maybe we do not have the specialties. We have the specialties right here in the Mater hospital. Men and women of professional classes want to continue and they are just not being given the money. It is crazy. To that end, I wrote to Mr. Stephen Mulvany on Tuesday to find out why the money is not being raised. I will come back to the Senator when I get a response because it is a similar issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Black raised the Irish Anti-Apartheid Campaign for Palestine movement, which was launched yesterday, for which I thank her. She is really consistent on this. I will bring the message to the Minister and ask for a debate. It will probably be after Christmas at this stage, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I do not even know what to say to Senator Boylan. First, I thank her for raising the issue, which acknowledges the respect we have for each other in this House. I hope that I have equal respect not just for the House but for every single Member regardless of whether he or she is in my party. The very least we need to do is show respect to Members and the contributions they make to legislation in this House which, as Senator Ruane knows, are enormous, and not just from the Opposition but also from my own colleagues. It would have done an absolute injustice and disservice to the Bill and to the people in this House if I had done what was asked of me, particularly when there was no need to do so. What I propose, to which I know the Senator will object, is that we take Second Stage on Tuesday and clear the decks on Thursday of Order of Business and Commencement Matters. I will increase the number of Commencement Matters on Tuesday and Wednesday and we will take the whole day on Thursday for whatever it takes to take Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Bill. The Bill will obviously go to the Dáil the following week. The information I have been given, and I do not really know how this is going to work, to be honest with the Senator, is that the recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny will be brought as amendments to the Dáil next week by the Minister - presumably, the ones with which he agrees - and the Bill will then come back to us on Thursday. Therefore, I will try to clear the decks on Thursday so that we have enough time to talk when it returns to us. I know that is not ideal but given the time constraints I have between this, the Social Welfare Bill, Finance Bill and others, it is the very best I can do. I obviously totally appreciate the Senator's perspective, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Senator Clonan spoke about his very unique connection with Romania and Bram Stoker. It is a beautiful country. I thank him for putting that on the record and also the assessment of needs. When it is reported upon, the Acting Leader, Senator Chambers, and I will try to organise a debate as quickly as we can so that we can exert the pressure where it needs to go to get those recommendations into actions as opposed to just more talking.</p>

          <p eId="para_191"> Your Excellency, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, on behalf of the Members of both Houses and on my own behalf I wish to welcome you to this historical joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">
            <i>Frau Präsidentin von der Leyen, hundert tausend mal, bitte Ich Sie im irischen Parlament, herzlich willkommen. </i>
          </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> President von der Leyen, you are very welcome to the Irish Parliament. We welcome you also as the first woman President of the Commission, an inspiration to women politicians here in Ireland, in Europe and indeed across the world. Is mór againn tú a bheith linn i seomra a bhfuil sé de shásamh dúinn le 100 bliain anuas a bheith ann. Bhí sé de stuaim ag Mícheál Ó Coileáin, tírghráthóir, úsáid an tseomra seo a lorg ó Chumann Ríoga Átha Cliath sa bhliain 1922 – am a raibh an Cogadh Cathartha ar siúl in Éirinn - agus táimid anseo ó shin; ceann den líon beag daonlathas parlaiminteach a cruthaíodh le linn ré sin na réabhlóide agus a mhaireann fós agus atá ag fónamh dá dhaoine.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> We have the honour, Madame President, of receiving you in a Chamber which we have had the pleasure of occupying for the past 100 years. Michael Collins, an Irish patriot, had the foresight to seek the temporary use of this Chamber from the Royal Dublin Society in 1922 - a time of Civil War in Ireland - and we have been here since; one of the very few parliamentary democracies created during an era of revolution which still survives and is serving its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Madame President, you come to speak to us at an auspicious time. We are on the cusp of celebrating 50 years in the European Union. Ireland signed the Treaty of Accession to the join the European Economic Community in 1972 and joined the Community on 1 January 1973. In the last 50 years we, as a people, have seen the transformative effects of that membership in terms of the transition from an agrarian economy to a modern economic model, strong economic growth, free-flowing inward investment, vast and often welcome changes in our social and civil fabric, and freedom of travel, to name but a few of the beneficial effects we have witnessed. And we are now, a small island on the west coast of Europe, at the heart of a market of half a billion citizens living peacefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Ní neart go cur le chéile, deirimid. There is no strength without unity. We are stronger together. And while we value peace in the Union, you also address us in a time of war in the Ukraine and of deep economic uncertainty - both circumstances created by the unjustified and unprovoked attack on a member of the European family. The Members of these Houses have had the pleasure of hearing from the outstanding and impressive President Zelenskyy. As a member of the European Union we stand in solidarity with him and with the Ukrainian people, and as a country we will remain steadfast in our support for the Ukrainian people in the time ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I want to acknowledge the presence of two important people here. Our own Commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, who needs no introduction. I suppose you are not our Commissioner now but you are the Commissioner from Ireland. You are very welcome. In the Public Gallery, overlooking her Sinn Féin team, is the designated First Minister for the Northern Ireland Assembly, and we all hope that assembly assembles and allows the important work of government in the North of Ireland to commence. Michelle O'Neill, you are heartily welcome, together with your team.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> President von der Leyen, the floor is yours.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Today I join you in this home of Irish democracy, and I do not feel like I have travelled to the edge of our Union, because while that may be true geographically, Ireland lies at the heart of Europe in every other way. This is a country of proud Europeans. Today all other Europeans look up to Ireland because you show Europe’s best face: innovative and inclusive, loyal to your history and traditions, open to the future and the world. This is the country that you have built in one century of independence and half a century of European membership. It is the country your ancestors fought for and dreamt of.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Exactly 50 years ago, Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a prophecy about Ireland’s future in the European Union. He was campaigning for Ireland to join the European Economic Community and he explained that not only was the future of Ireland at stake, but the future of Europe. He had faith that the Irish people could, and I quote, "help fashion for themselves and for future generations a better Ireland in a better Europe". This is what I would like to talk about today.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Most Irish people will agree that EU membership has made Ireland a better place, but the other side of the story is just as important. Ireland has made Europe a better place. Europe owes you. Today I have not come here to praise our Union and its achievements but to thank the Irish people for everything you have brought to our Union in these 50 years and everything you will keep bringing in the many years ahead. As the Irish language is, since this year, an official language of the European Union - I have to train my Irish - go raibh maith agaibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Let me start with how Ireland has changed, before I talk about how it has changed Europe. We all know the Irish success story in our Union. Joining the European Union has unleashed Ireland’s immense potential and has profoundly transformed this country. In 1973, Ireland’s GDP per capita was around half the European Union's average. Today, it is double the average. This is thanks to our unique Single Market and thanks to the ingenuity of the Irish people. Ireland has made the best of all the opportunities that are there and that come with the freedom to trade, travel, study and work across the European Union. Irish society has blossomed too. When I was a teenager, married Irish women were banned from working in the public sector, for whatever reason, but because of Ireland's accession to the European community, in 1973 this Parliament passed its first gender equality legislation. Since then, the rights of women in Ireland have come such a long way. In 1990, Mary Robinson became the country’s first woman President. In her words, the women of Ireland - I love this - went from "rocking the cradle" to "rock[ing] the system". Now Ireland is one of the best countries in Europe for female employment levels and women in science and technology jobs. It was also the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage in a referendum. Powerful grassroots movements lead to powerful legislative changes. Ireland has become a beacon for Europe and the world. </p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Let me again take you back to 1973 for a moment. The Troubles were blazing and attempts at bridge-building between communities would founder by the following year. However, far-sighted Irish politicians also understood that European membership could establish new economic and personal ties and gradually help remove the tensions that were obstructing the quest for peace. This is, indeed, what happened. Of course, the conflict on the island of Ireland did not end overnight. Yet, slowly but surely trust was built both between Dublin and London, and between communities </p>
          <p eId="para_206">that lived on different sides of a wall. Europe was the incentive to look beyond the barbed wire, to build bridges and reap the economic benefits of cross-border co-operation. The great European John Hume described Europe´s role as being "both practical and inspirational" for the peace process. We all know our Union was once founded as a peace project. Here, on the island of Ireland, </p>
          <p eId="para_207">Europe demonstrated this unique power to bring about peace. Europe’s role in the peace process brought Europe right back to its roots.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> This has made Brexit even more painful for all of us. Its consequences are most deeply felt on this island, well beyond the economic dimension, but Brexit has also thrust Ireland and the rest of the European Union closer together. Ireland has benefited from the iron-clad solidarity of the Union and all its member states, big and small. All Europeans immediately understood how important it was</p>
          <p eId="para_209">to preserve peace on the island of Ireland. After Brexit, our Union has doubled down on its commitment to peace. For instance, we are now providing €1 billion to the Border counties in Ireland and to Northern Ireland with our PEACE PLUS programme. Since it was created in 1995, together with the Irish and UK Governments, the EU’s PEACE programme has replaced border check-points with sports venues, schools and community centres. It has brought together people from different communities, who lived side by side but had never met each other. One thing is absolutely clear: Brexit will not become an obstacle on the path of reconciliation in Ireland. That is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I am glad that today our talks with London are marked by a new, more pragmatic spirit. The European Union and the United Kingdom are still members of the same extended family, even if we no longer live in the same house. I can promise you that whenever the European Union sits down with our British friends, we will do so with "an honest heart and an open mind", to quote the great Irish band The Saw Doctors. By applying common sense and focusing on the issues that really matter in Northern Ireland, I believe we can make progress in resolving the practical issues surrounding the protocol. We are listening closely to business and civil society stakeholders in Northern Ireland but the consequences of Brexit and the kind of Brexit chosen by the UK cannot be removed entirely. The solutions we find must ensure the Single Market continues to function, in Ireland and elsewhere in the European Union. If both sides are sensitive to this careful balance, a workable solution is within reach. I believe we have a duty to find it. My contacts with Prime Minister Sunak are encouraging and I trust we can find the way. Let me reassure you: Ireland can always count on the European Union to stand by the Good Friday Agreement. There can be no hard border on the island of Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Honourable Members, European membership has done Ireland good, but that is only half of the story. Today, I would also like to reflect about what Ireland brings to our Union and what it could contribute in the years to come. Europe is what we all make of it. Indeed, we can all benefit from a bit more of the Irish approach to life, as John F. Kennedy pointed out when speaking here almost 60 years ago. He quoted George Bernard Shaw, another great Irishman, when he said, "Other people ... see things and say: 'Why?' But I dream things that never were - and I say: 'Why not?'" Ireland´s future is built on opportunity, optimism and openness. Europe needs this positive vision for a competitive economy, for a green, digital, trade-oriented European Union, with a global role, reinforced by Ireland’s strong links across the Atlantic and with the English-speaking world.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Today I would like to dwell on five Irish virtues that will help our Union to face our common challenges ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The first is the Irish passion for freedom. This country knows what it means to struggle for the right to exist. Today, another European nation is fighting for its independence. Ireland is far away from the frontline in Ukraine, but you understand better than most why this war matters so much to all of us. Like our friends in eastern Europe, you know that in Ukraine, more is at stake than the future of only one country. Ukraine is fighting for freedom itself, for self-rule and for the rules-based global order. Ireland has gone above and beyond in its support to Ukraine. In these months, tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Putin’s bombs in the east, found the famous Irish welcome here in the west. Ireland was also an early supporter of Ukraine’s application to join the European Union. I want to thank you, Taoiseach, for being such a vocal and determined supporter. When the citizens of Kherson raised the European Union's blue and gold flag, as well as the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine to greet their liberators, it was a powerful visual confirmation of the people's desire to belong to our Union. We have shown that our Union is the home of all European countries striving for freedom and democracy. Our support to Ukraine must continue for as long as it takes until Ukrainians fully recover what Russia has tried to take from them: their freedom, a saoirse.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> This leads me to the second point. Europe should learn the Irish resolve or, some may say, the Irish stubbornness. History has never been easy on Ireland, but you have never surrendered your soul. Whenever history hit you, you fought back. A country of emigrants has turned into a magnet for global talents. After each crisis, you have risen up again; after the Troubles, after the financial crisis and again after Covid-19. Ireland has constantly transformed its economy to make it one of the most successful in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Now, a new crisis is hitting Europe. The fallout from the war in Ukraine is weighing on households and businesses across the European Union. The whole of Europe needs your stubbornness today to keep supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes and to break free from our dependency on Russian fossil fuels. We need your stubbornness. Since the start of the war, Russia has cut 80% of our pipeline gas, but Europe has managed to replace most of it. We have saved 15% of our energy demand and our storage is full, at 95%; we are safe for this winter, but let us look beyond. It is no exaggeration to say that we stand at a crossroads; either we ignore the lessons of this crisis and fall again into the trap of a carbon lock-in for the future or we use this crisis to leapfrog to clean energy. Renewables are not only good for our climate, but they are home-grown and thus also good for our independence and our security of energy supply. Here, too, Europe has much to learn from this green island. Even though Ireland is far away from Russia and Ukraine, you are making an essential contribution to overcoming our energy crisis. Ireland is a wind energy superpower and a key player in our European Green Deal. Last year, 31% of Ireland’s electricity came from wind turbines, a share topped only by Denmark. You are now doubling down on your commitments. Ireland's landmark Climate Act 2021 set ambitious goals to cut emissions by 51% by 2030 and to increase your renewable share up to 80%. This is good for Ireland and it is good for Europe because Ireland can become a net exporter of energy and help the rest of Europe replace Russian fossil fuels. The new electricity interconnector to France, supported by European funds, will become yet another engine of growth here in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> This leads to the third Irish contribution I would like to discuss, which is ingenuity. This country of poets and artists has now become a country of start-ups, too. Several Irish start-ups have become global players, from Stripe, the multi-billion euro payment processing platform founded by two Limerick brothers, to Flipdish, digitising restaurants and bars, for instance, by setting up online orders and QR codes at tables. Access to Europe’s Single Market, amplified by Ireland's supporting policies and qualities, helps indigenous start-ups to grow. It has also made Ireland hugely attractive to foreign investment. Ireland has become a hub for the world’s most innovative companies, from pharma to high tech. You are taking the responsibility to regulate this crucial sector. Europeans depend heavily on Irish authorities to ensure that the many tech giants based here comply with our common privacy rules. Ireland can be the home base for the human-centred Internet Europe wants to build. The European Commission looks forward to working very closely with Ireland in implementing new EU digital legislation such as the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. This will keep the digital economy fair and competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> This brings me to my fourth point, openness. Ireland is Europe’s springboard over the Atlantic, a gateway to the world. Two centuries of emigration have given Ireland an unparalleled soft power and diplomatic network. Right now, both the US and Australia have leaders with proud Irish ancestry; there are few countries more skilled than Ireland at leveraging the influence and friendship of a historic diaspora, but it is not just that. Ireland is an exporting powerhouse and a staunch supporter of free trade. Europe has an unparalleled network of trade agreements, with 46 deals with 78 partners. As we confront a more fragmented global order, the value of trade agreements is increasing, which is why, in the coming years, Europe will need to invest even more in its trade with the world. It is not just about energy, we must also supply the essential raw materials we need for the green and digital transitions. Over the next year, we aim to sign trade deals with New Zealand, Chile and Mexico, and to advance ongoing negotiations with Australia, Indonesia and India. Trade is once again at the heart of Europe’s foreign policy agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Honourable Members, the last and most important contribution from Ireland to our European Union is your optimism.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Let me go back to 1972 again, when 83% of Irish people voted yes to joining the European Community. The Irish were by far the most pro-Europe of the three applicant countries that held referendums. Today, 50 years later, the exact same percentage of people in Ireland, 83%, are optimistic about the EU's future. This is once again the highest percentage of any country in the European Union. The story of Ireland in the European Union is a story of optimism. You, the Irish people, have built your own good fortune through thick and thin. Jack Lynch was an optimist when he said that he could make Ireland and the European Union a better place. The heroes of the Easter Rising and the architects of the Good Friday Agreement were optimists because they believed that they could change the course of history. That is their greatest lesson for us. They dared to look beyond the imperfection of what is to see the beauty of what could be. This is what Europe needs today. We need to believe that Ukraine can win this war. We need to believe that we can break free once and for all from the enslavement of Russian fossil fuels. We need to believe that a climate-neutral future is within reach. We must do everything in our power to turn this hope into reality because it depends on us. </p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Long live Ireland. Long live the European Union. </p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_222">A Cheann Chomhairle, a Chathaoirligh, a Bhaill an Oireachtais agus a Uachtaráin von der Leyen, cuirim céad míle fáilte romhaibh chuig an gcomhshuí speisialta seo de Dháil agus de Sheanad Éireann tráthnóna inniu. Is pribhléid agus onóir mhór dúinn, a Uachtaráin, go bhfuil tú anseo linn ag ceiliúradh 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach ón uair a chaith pobal na tíre seo vóta sa reifreann ar 10 Bealtaine, 1972. Táimid fíorbhuíoch díot, a Uachtaráin, as ucht do cheannaireachta san Eoraip agus ar son do chuid oibre ar fad agus an tacaíocht go léir a thugann tú go leanúnach don tír seo. Mar Thaoiseach, táim iontach sásta go bhfuil an tír seo lárnach i ngnóthaí na hEorpa agus go dtugtar cluas éisteachta don tír ag leibhéal Eorpach.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I thank President von der Leyen for her visit here today. It is a day to celebrate and to reflect on our membership of the European Union. Let me begin by recalling the words of my predecessor as Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who President von der Leyen described as an optimist. I reflected as she said that it is obvious why he was an optimist - he was born in the city of Cork where optimism is always aplenty. When Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, speaking in Brussels in January 1972 where he had just signed the Accession Treaty with his colleague Patrick Hillery, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_224">Geography has placed us on the periphery of the Continent. But we are an integral part of Europe, bound to it by many centuries of shared civilisation, traditions and ideals... Since statehood, my country, conscious of its European past, has sought to forge new and stronger links with the Continent. In this, we were renewing and revitalizing historic bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">These words continue to resonate and help to explain, five decades later, why our welcome for President von der Leyen in these Houses today is such a genuine and heartfelt one. One of the most inspiring things about that decision 50 years ago is that despite the misgivings and opposition of some, the Irish people took the path of hope, voting overwhelmingly in favour of membership, a decision that has been vindicated time and time again. During the past 50 years sharing our sovereignty with our European partners has helped to make us all safer, stronger and more prosperous. Close reciprocal co-operation with our European partners has been central to our transformation, helping us to emerge as a modern, open economy and society. Ireland’s membership of this Union has had an overwhelmingly positive impact across all dimensions of our society. For our part, Ireland has been proud to contribute strongly to the shaping of today’s European Union, which we have come to see as our home. </p>
          <p eId="para_226"> A Cheann Chomhairle, it is unfortunately impossible to talk about Europe today without reflecting on the appalling events unfolding in Ukraine. Russia’s illegal and immoral aggression against its peaceful neighbour represents an horrific and violent assault. The impact on the Ukrainian people has been devastating and truly shocking. When I visited in July I heard first-hand civilian accounts of the brutality and violence visited upon Ukrainian men, women and children by occupying Russian forces. The wanton destruction, including targeting of nuclear facilities and of other energy and civilian infrastructure, shows Russia behaving as a rogue state. The impact of Russia’s aggression has also reached far beyond Ukraine and has affected every home and business. The energy crisis and its impact on the cost of living is as keenly felt here in Ireland as it is in other countries throughout the European Union. The Irish people have, in the face of this destruction and devastation, opened our communities, our homes and our hearts to more than 65,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Ireland since the end of February. We remain unswerving in our political support for Ukraine, including in championing Ukraine’s path towards European Union membership. The Government in Kyiv is firmly determined, despite the awful circumstances in which it operates, to meet the high bar required for accession to the European Union. I have consistently advocated that a free, sovereign and democratic Ukraine is part of our European family and belongs in the European Union. As temperatures drop and as Russia keeps up its relentless attacks on vital civilian infrastructure, the people of Ukraine face a long and very difficult winter. </p>
          <p eId="para_227"> President von der Leyen, like you, this Parliament stands in solidarity with Ukraine. With you, the people of Ireland stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine. President von der Leyen, I would like to commend you on your leadership in response to this horrific war. When you and your new team of Commissioners took office this day three years ago, you committed to deliver a greener, fairer and more digital European Union. The strength of your commitment to this objective has been maintained, and indeed increased, through two historic crises, the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The scale of the challenges which have confronted the European Union and its member states since early 2020 has been immense but our response, with your leadership, has been likewise unprecedented.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> When Covid-19 struck, the European Union found itself in uncharted territory with responsibility at national level potentially limiting the European Union’s scope for action on public health. Despite this complexity, the leadership provided by the European Commission played no small part in mobilising a decisive European Union response that demonstrated to our citizens the strength in our unity. In particular, the European Commission was central to efforts to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of safe and effective vaccines.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I well remember our many both brief and detailed conversations at critical times during the early months of the vaccine programme. I would like, on a personal level, to thank you on behalf of the Irish people for your steadfast commitment to ensuring equality between countries in achieving access to the vaccines. We were only able to implement one of the most successful vaccine programmes in the world because of the secure supplies which we secured through joint European Union programmes. Many lives and livelihoods were saved because of this. Europe was not only the place where the world’s first licensed MRNA vaccine was developed, by BioNTech in Germany, but unlike others, Europe exported vaccines and their components throughout the pandemic, offering hope and solidarity to others around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The European Union also broke new ground in response to the economic challenge of the pandemic. The historic €2 trillion EU budgetary package agreed by the European Council in July 2020 was a milestone in European Union solidarity. It sent an important message that, in the most testing of times, European Union leaders can work together and find a solution that delivers for our citizens. This has provided substantial funding for economic recovery across Europe through targeted and front-loaded green and digital investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> In response to the current energy crisis, you have maintained a strong focus on accelerating the green transition, through initiatives such as REPowerEU, as the only viable long-term solution. The war has only reinforced the need to step up investments in energy infrastructure, including interconnections, and in innovative renewable technologies to enhance our energy security and to meet our climate ambitions. There is no time to waste. Last week in Paris, we signed contracts for the Celtic interconnector project. A remarkable 575 km of cable will link Cork to Brittany. Over €500 million has been contributed through the EU Connecting Europe Facility, and the interconnector will bring real benefits to the citizens of both France and Ireland. It is a further practical demonstration of the mutual benefits of co-operation throughout the European Union and is only the first step in terms of developing a true European grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The Commission has also played a decisive role in reinforcing our collective commitment to social progress through support for initiatives such as the European Pillar of Social Rights. This is reflected in the endorsement by European Union leaders in May 2021 of the Porto declaration, which includes concrete employment, skills and poverty-reduction targets to be achieved by 2030. It is a reminder that the EU has been the greatest force for employment growth and social progress in our history. As we have discussed many times, the facts show that it is the citizens of Europe who have benefited every time we have shown urgency and ambition in developing the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> The EU is, of course, one of the finest examples of conflict resolution and peace building the world has ever seen. During my visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in June, I had the honour of unveiling a bust of one of the greatest Irish people and Europeans of the 20th century, John Hume. John Hume saw the same three principles at the heart of the European Union that came to underpin peace in Ireland: respect for difference, which otherwise becomes conflict; institutions which respect this difference; and working together in the common interest that breaks down the barriers of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The part played by the EU in our journey towards peace and reconciliation on this island has been significant. Our European partners also made, and continue to make, their contribution through steadfast support for generous peace and reconciliation programmes. You have stood with Ireland and Northern Ireland as we worked together to manage the unique challenges for this island resulting from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union: making the objectives of sustaining peace, avoiding a hard border - I welcome your strong comments again today in respect of that - and protecting the all-island economy a European Union priority from the very beginning of negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I had the opportunity earlier today to once again express to you, President von der Leyen, our appreciation for the European Union’s unswerving solidarity with Ireland throughout Brexit. Like you, we want to see a new and vital partnership with the United Kingdom, a constructive one, which will be achieved if we can resolve the issues relating to the protocol. With the right political will, I believe we can achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> We are a free democracy. We have loud debates which include a full range of opinions, but let there be no doubt where the Irish people stand in relation to the European Union and our membership. The Eurobarometer report earlier this year showed 71% of Irish citizens holding a positive view of the European Union, the highest figure recorded, and significantly higher than the EU 27 average of 44%. It showed as many as 88% of Irish citizens being optimistic about the future of the European Union. We should never take this support for granted. We must continue to seek and embrace ways to engage citizens on the aims and the benefits of this great Union. We must continue to have a positive agenda of seeking ways to make our Union stronger and more effective. Thank you, President von der Leyen, for your visit today, for your support over the past three years and for your distinguished contribution to shaping Europe’s future.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">Thank you. It was remiss of me at the outset not to welcome members of the diplomatic corps from across the world who are joining us here today, and in particular to make mention of H.E Larysa Gerasko, our great friend and the champion of Ukraine here in Ireland, who does so much work for her people and her country.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_239">Is mór an onóir dom a bheith anseo ar an ócáid stairiúil seo. On behalf of the Fine Gael party, as you know, a proud member of the European People's Party, I am privileged to join with the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach to welcome you to the Oireachtas today - there is a Cork thing going on today. Your leadership as President of the European Commission over the last three years and your friendship towards this island has time and time again proven indispensable to Ireland as we navigate the unprecedented challenges that have been faced. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these three years is not the extent of the challenges our Union has faced, but the degree of solidarity with which we have collectively met those challenges. That is thanks to your able and steadfast leadership through that period of turmoil. During the darkest days of Covid-19, we saw that solidarity when our fellow citizens were airlifted from one member state to another, granting crucial relief to overburdened hospitals. We saw how you and your Commission led the purchase of life-saving vaccines to ensure that all 450 million EU citizens had fair access.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Ireland knows first-hand the value of European solidarity. Throughout the EU-UK negotiations following the Brexit vote, the European Commission has never once wavered in its solidarity with Ireland in a Union where, increasingly, we look out for one another. Four years ago, when your predecessor addressed this House, my colleagues thanked both him and Michel Barnier for the leadership they had shown through the Brexit negotiations. Today, I want to echo that gratitude by sincerely thanking you and, in particular, Vice-President Šefčovič, for your tireless work in supporting peace in Northern Ireland, for your continued patience and intelligence and for your willingness to continue to look for solutions to the ongoing issues of concern around the Northern Ireland protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The United Kingdom is our neighbour. It is our friend and a country that we and the rest of the EU want a deep partnership with, as they travel a new journey outside of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I hope that with a new UK Prime Minister and, indeed, a new context internationally, we can now grasp the opportunity to resolve our Brexit-related differences in the coming weeks through dialogue and compromise. I too believe a solution is within our grasp if we have a partner to achieve an outcome we can all accept and move on from.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> In doing that, I hope we can create a basis for a new and stronger relationship at a time of international conflict and strife. The European Union is, after all, a peace project founded on bringing peace and stability to our shared Continent. That is why we in Ireland will not waver in our support for Ukraine. We have made it clear since the horrors of this war began that military non-alignment does not mean that we stand on the sidelines. In the face of Russian aggression and blatant breaches of international and humanitarian law, Ireland is not neutral. Indeed, following the leadership of the European Commission under President von der Leyen, Ireland stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people today and in the months ahead. Irish people have warmly accepted more than 65,000 Ukrainians into their communities across the country, in virtually every parish and indeed into their homes. We will continue to work with President von der Leyen financially and politically to support Ukraine in its fight to protect its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work with her to protect the Ukrainian people from the brutality of Russian military attack on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> We will also use every avenue at our disposal to hold Russia accountable for its actions and we will continue to support EU sanctions that increase the cost for the Kremlin of its continued aggression. We strongly support your efforts, President, to make progress on investigating and ultimately prosecuting Russia's crime of aggression in an international court setting supported by the EU and the UN. We look forward to the day when Ukraine will be part of our Union and we will continue to support Ukraine every step of the way on that journey towards full membership. For us, this is the essence of what our Union is all about - the right of every European country and every European citizen to enjoy the benefits of peace, prosperity, human rights, dignity, equality and the protections of the rule of law on which every citizen should insist.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Some 50 years ago, Ireland joined the then European Communities. I was delighted that President von der Leyen was able, earlier today, to meet some of the schoolchildren who took part in the Ireland EU50 Youth Competition. The Ireland in which those schoolchildren are growing up today is vastly different from that of 50 years ago. EU membership has transformed almost every aspect of Irish society. Ireland today has a modern, open and innovative economy at the heart of the EU Single Market but, more important, we have a diverse, open and tolerant society looking to the future with optimism. We are the better for all of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> This peaceful and prosperous island is not just an Irish success; it is a European success. In this dark winter of war, we would do well to remember the hope that stems from the European story we have to share, written over the past 50 years. Yes, President von der Leyen, that is a story of optimism in the face of immense challenges. Thank you for your leadership and, perhaps more important, your continued ambition for the journey the EU must continue to travel. We are by your side.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Eamon Ryan)<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_247">President von der Leyen, go raibh maith agat for your leadership during the Covid pandemic. Danke schön for your strength in our response to the war in Ukraine. Merci beaucoup for standing up for the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish protocol. On behalf of the European Green Party, I thank you for putting the European Green Deal at the centre of the whole economic strategy and social strategy for our Union at this critical time.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> We know it is the right strategy because Europe is at risk. We could end up with a situation where we import all our software from the US in the west, all our hardware from China in the east and all our energy from Russia and Ukraine. Where would that leave us in terms of security or prosperity for the future? We believe and agree, like President von der Leyen has shown in her leadership, that this is a time to go back to our roots, but instead of a coal and steel union, at the centre now is going to be an electricity cable and fibre optic cable future for our 27 member countries. That strategy is why I thank President von der Leyen for the leadership she is showing. It will be renewable, as she said. It will be digital and it has to see nature restored for all our countries and people.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> When it comes to Ireland doing that, yes, as President von der Leyen stated, we can sometimes be a beacon of light, but we should be open and honest and recognise that at times in the past 50 years we have been through storms. Sometimes, that light has not been seen. You have to accept us, as a fellow Member said using an Irish political phrase, warts and all. In that 50 years, we may have taken our beautiful island with its 40 shades of green for granted at times and not protected our local environment. We tripped up on two or three occasions when we had major recessions and saw ongoing emigration. All Members of this House recognise that we have a real issue at the moment providing homes for our people and the people who come rightly to our shores in need of help and looking to be part of this country that has, as President von der Leyen stated, stubborn optimism and openness to the world. We are not perfect, but in some way that puts us in a good place. If we can live up to this vision of a low carbon, digital and renewable future, other countries will say that if Ireland can do it, they can do it too. If the prodigal daughter can make it back home to living on this planet in a sustainable way, maybe we could be a lesson to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> What President von der Leyen stated is true. We stand on the precipice of real opportunity, at this cutting edge of the Atlantic and Europe, ready to tap into that Atlantic power and share it with our neighbours. The interconnector in respect of which the Taoiseach and I signed an agreement in Paris last Friday is not just a power cable. It is also fibre optic connected. We are going to look to connect Irish universities to France and beyond using that cable. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear that the previous week we saw a similar cable coming from Iceland into Galway Bay. Now we are looking to see if we can head south to Portugal to be part of this interconnected and digitally connected European Union. That is what we can and will do as a country as part of the transition that President von der Leyen is leading.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> We have done this sort of transition before. From the late 1950s through to when we joined the European Union, we went from a closed economic model to an open one. We did that by being consistent on some principles behind it, such as investing in education for all our people, joining the European Union and being open to enterprise and trade. Today, there are some similar principles in this new Union President von der Leyen is leading. First, it has to be based on climate justice. We saw that in Sharm el-Sheikh, where the European Union team made a significant contribution in breaking the north-south divide in the world. I was so proud when, at 4 o'clock on Saturday night, Sunday morning, the Polish representative said that what we had done was an example of European collaboration. That was true. We also need that justice here at home. The Fit for 55 legislative package President von der Leyen is leading out, with 20 major pieces of legislation, has to provide a just transition in this new economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Last but not least, I will pick up on what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about this being a peace project. It can be in this way; this new power is a shared power that has particular characteristics that are diverse, decentralised and limitless. We are in a race to the top with China and the US on this. Their success will not undermine ours. The Inflation Reduction Act could see their technology develop, but we can share in that because it is a shared power. If we go out with that attitude to the world, being innovative and clever on this and seeing it as a peak project in that way, we will succeed. I wish President von der Leyen the best of luck. I thank her for her leadership.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">Ireland is a proud, ancient European nation. In the new year, we will mark 50 years since becoming a member of what was then the European Communities in 1973. Since then, it has been quite a journey. There have been so many positive advances in areas such as equality, workers’ rights, environmental standards and economic progress. There have been many challenges too, including growing militarisation, deregulation and privatisation, to mention just some. However, on this journey, solidarity, fairness and a conviction that we can be at our strongest when we work together to make a real, positive difference to people’s lives has guided our greatest successes.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> I warmly welcome President von der Leyen. Cuirim fáilte mór roimpi go dtí an Teach. Through her leadership of the Commission, she has been a very good friend to Ireland and demonstrated her desire to work with Ireland towards these common goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> This year, Europe has shown the power of its unity and solidarity in standing squarely with the people of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s barbaric invasion has shocked the world. His illegal and unjust war must be stopped and the horror and bloodshed must end. In this time of crisis, Europe has come together in solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they endure and courageously resist this grotesque war. This solidarity has sent a powerful message to Putin that Ukraine is not alone, and that Europe and Ireland will stand up for what is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Recent years have also shown Ireland the importance of European solidarity as we weather the storm of Brexit. There was never any such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland. The people of the North of Ireland voted to remain in the EU, but were dragged out against their will by Britain, spearheaded by the Tories at the urging of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP. Throughout years of fractious negotiations, the EU stood steadfast with Ireland and our determination to protect our peace process and the Good Friday Agreement - a peace agreement that will be 25 years old next year - which has transformed our island and shown that conflict can end and peace can triumph. Prior to the Good Friday Agreement, British Army checkpoints marked the Border. British military installations, built and reinforced from the 1970s onwards, were symbols of division and conflict. The invisible border on the island of Ireland has now become our greatest symbol of peace. There can never be a return to a hard Border in Ireland. I welcome President von der Leyen's forceful assertion of that reality today.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> It is important to acknowledge that the Good Friday Agreement is a mighty diplomatic success, not just for Ireland but the European Union. For that, we commend and thank President von der Leyen. The EU has been a critical partner for peace, providing political and financial support leading to greater economic and social progress on an all-island basis. It is important to acknowledge and thank, in particular, Michel Barnier, Maroš Šefčovič and their teams for their determination and tenacity in holding firm in defence of the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol defending peace and progress in Ireland. The EU’s solidarity will remain essential to us as we continue to address the fallout of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Currently, the institutions in the North of our country lie dormant as the DUP continues its shameful boycott. Workers and families in the North pay the price of not having an Executive to work hard and deliver for them during the current cost-of-living crisis. It bears repeating that the protocol is working. It is necessary to protect the North from the damages inflicted by Brexit. It is supported, as President von der Leyen knows, by the majority of democratically elected representatives in the North and throughout the island. While issues around the implementation of the protocol exist, they can be resolved by good faith engagement. We must see calm and clear leadership from those at the negotiating table. We heard words from the new British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. He has committed to restoring the political institutions and resolving issues around the implementation of the protocol. Of course, those words are very welcome but they must be matched by action and meaningful talks between the British Government and the European Commission. I know it is President von der Leyen's fervent desire to engage constructively. That is precisely what is needed, not sabre-rattling or any more threats to breach international law.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">Ireland has changed and is changing. Brexit is responsible for some of that. The EU took a significant decision when it stated to our then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, at the outset of Brexit that, in the context of Irish reunification, the North will automatically rejoin the EU and the North’s citizens will become full EU citizens once again. That is a very important statement recognising that the Good Friday Agreement sets out the next step on Ireland’s journey; the ending of partition and the holding of referendums on reunification. The responsible thing for all of us to do now is to prepare for democratic, orderly and planned constitutional change. President von der Leyen acknowledged our great love of saoirse, freedom, and our refusal to give up, concede or surrender to division or discrimination. We have come a very long way but we have another length of the journey to go. Just as the Commission played a key role in the peace process, I believe that the EU can and will play a positive role in the last length of that journey to Irish reunification, namely, a united Ireland within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Tá an t-athrú seo ag tarlú tar éis 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na tíre san Aontas Eorpach. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí sa chomhrá seo ná go gcaithfimid éisteacht le muintir na hEorpa. Tá dúil aige sa chomhionannas agus sa phróiseas. Caithfear todhchaí a thógáil ina mbeidh oibrithe, teaghlaigh agus pobail cosanta os cionn leasanna dílsithe nó iad siúd a bhfuil cumhacht acu. We want to see a bridging of the democratic deficit at a European level. We want to see advances on workers' rights, environmental protection, social justice, sustainable and ethical trade, research and development, which are all areas where we can make progress but they will challenge the EU. They will challenge certain orthodoxies and we must rise to that challenge. The climate emergency is an existential one. As Ireland works to secure energy security and energy independence, as President von der Leyen acknowledged, and a greener future for younger generations, we know that solidarity is crucial in delivering the major changes that are needed to secure a really meaningful impact. Through working together on these issues, we can deliver tangible and lasting change to our citizens’ lives. That is our vision for Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> We are an island nation at once on the periphery of Europe and at the heart of Europe. However, to be Irish is not simply to be from a small nation. We are also part of a powerful global family. We are something of an outlier as a European state in that we were colonised; we were not the coloniser. We have seen conflict, partition and occupation. We are and will remain a militarily neutral and non-aligned country. The President quoted a formidable Irish American earlier on and I want to go to the other side of the world and echo the words shared in this Chamber 35 years ago by the then Australian Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. He described us well when he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_263">Ireland is the head of a huge empire in which Australia and the United States are the principal provinces. It is an empire acquired not by force of Irish arms but by force of Irish character, an empire not of political coercion but of spiritual affiliation, created by the thousands upon thousands of Irish men and women who chose to leave these shores, or who were banished from them, to help in the building of new societies over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">In an increasingly complex world in which our multilateral institutions must work and prevail, the presence of military neutrals and non-aligned countries can be a critical interlocutor in the work of peace, disarmament and social justice. The next step is the recognition and acknowledgement of military neutrals and non-aligned countries within the EU treaties and EU basic law. That must happen within the Constitution of our country also. This would be a hugely positive step forward and would add to the diplomatic repertoire and scope of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> There is no doubt there are many challenges facing Europe. If we are true to our shared commitments and values, they can show what can be achieved through solidarity and resolve and they can improve our citizens’ lives. We remain committed to working with our European friends on these issues as we work for a better life for all our people. Seasann muid ag tráth athraithe san Eoraip. Is tráth dúshlánach é a chuireann deiseanna os ár gcomhair. Is am don rogha é freisin. Is féidir le todhchaí na hEorpa a bheith mar cheann de dhul chun cinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> We stand at a crossroads and we have decisions to make. The future of Europe can be one of retreat or one of hopeful progress; we must choose progress. It can be a future in which citizens can be disillusioned or empowered; we must choose empowerment. It can be a future of opportunities for the few at the top or a future of opportunity and prosperity for all; we must choose a race to the top. Now is the time to look forward to the future with ambition and hope. By working together we can build a new Ireland and reinvigorate the vision of Europe. We still believe we can make Ireland better. We still know we can help in making Europe better and we believe above all that, working together, we can make the world better too.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Uachtarán. It is my honour, on behalf of the Labour Party, to welcome her here to address our Oireachtas. I express our appreciation for her warm and optimistic words by way of address to us today. I also thank her for not only quoting our iconic first woman President, Mary Robinson, but also that iconic band the Saw Doctors. We all appreciated her quoting those. On a more serious note, I also welcome the President's officials and our distinguished guests today, the Ukrainian ambassador in particular. I thank the President for her words and her long-standing support for Ireland, both personally and through the Commission more generally, as we have moved through the ongoing fallout for this country from the Brexit decision and as we move to secure a resolution on the Northern Ireland protocol. We thank the President for her solidarity on that front too.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> The President made history as the first woman to lead the Commission and, as I have said, she has quoted from our first woman President here, Mary Robinson. We are all conscious of the huge gains that have been made for women's rights and for equality more generally in this country as a result of EU membership. It should be noted that Ireland has led on equality issues too. We have led across Europe in our referendum on marriage equality in 2015 and in our historic referendum to bring about abortion rights for women in 2018. We have led in some areas. However, we still have a lot more to do. While the President will hear from a number of women Deputies today, there are still far too few of us in the Dáil. Only 23% - fewer than one in four - of our Deputies are women, so on that front at least we have some way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> In her tenure as President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen has faced some of the greatest challenges that have bound us closer together as a European Union. These include Brexit, to which I have referred, the dreadful Covid pandemic, and more recently, Russia's brutal war on Ukraine. These challenges have reminded us all of the importance of the EU as a peace project, a collective endeavour and a model for promoting economic and social progress. In this country we are particularly conscious that the financial crash damaged the Union and important lessons were eventually learned. We hope the mistakes made then by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, will never be repeated. What all these crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state, and of collective action across states, in tackling crises and problems. We have learned that over-reliance on the market will not solve complex transnational and international problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> At EU level, the energy crisis brought on by Putin’s imperial war of conquest in Ukraine has shown the weaknesses of our artificially constructed energy markets, as record profits are made on renewable electricity due to the reliance on gas prices as a reference for setting electricity prices. That has been acknowledged at EU level. Too often in this country the excuse of EU competition rules is used as a barrier to necessary State action and it has also become a shield for Departments to put social services out to tender that should instead be run and funded directly by the State. However, it must be acknowledged, and it is welcome, that at EU level we have seen the benefits of transnational action on collective procurement for Covid vaccines, which was a huge benefit to this country and other countries during the pandemic. That ensured that, as a smaller country, we were able to secure supplies alongside larger countries. The need for collective action is nowhere more apparent than in response to the brutal war in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The strong action of the EU, in which Ireland has played a strong role, in delivering multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia has been welcome but we can do more. Our Government has failed to take up our Labour Party's proposal of Magnitsky legislation to punish human rights abusers and seize their assets. I would ask that the Commission would consider acting on this in an EU-wide approach to bring together a European Magnitsky law. On behalf of my party I welcome the President's move to establish a court to investigate and prosecute Russian crimes in Ukraine. That is a hugely important collective endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The war has also reminded us, as the President has said, of our enslavement to Russian fossil fuels across this Continent and of the need for swifter transformative climate action to address the existential climate emergency. The EU represents our best collective chance to achieve this by ensuring a community of 500 million people decarbonises in speedy time. More than ever we need the European Green Deal to be translated into action in our countries, across Europe and across the world, by supporting developing countries with a just transition and adequate resources to tackle the adverse effects of the climate emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Our party is the Irish member of the Party of European Socialists, PES. When I addressed the PES leaders conference in Berlin six weeks ago, I outlined the need for more action at EU level on workers’ rights, childcare, housing and the cost of living and on delivering the social Europe, that collective goal to which the Labour Party and the PES aspire. While we recognise the huge achievements of the EU in delivering rights for workers and women and in delivering maternity leave and employment protection rights, we recognise there is still much more to do. In Ireland we are seeking to bring forward legislation to provide for leave for women and their partners undergoing fertility treatment and to support women during early miscarriage. Again, we are urging the Commission to take this up at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I thank the President again on behalf of the Labour Party for her unwavering support for the peace process, for her stated commitment to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement will be protected, and for her optimism.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_275">I warmly welcome President von der Leyen to this joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas. On behalf of the Social Democrats, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on what is an historic occasion. In exactly one month, we will mark the 50th anniversary of Ireland joining what was then the European Economic Community. We do so as the region faces one of its greatest perils, namely, the barbaric invasion of Ukraine. We in Ireland stand firmly with other EU member states with Ukraine and against Putin's regime. We will not waver from this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Ireland has always been an enthusiastic member of the EU and the consequences of membership have been, in the main, positive for us. Membership has fast-tracked social and economic progress that would otherwise have taken much longer to advance or, indeed, that may not have happened at all. From establishing the principle of equal pay for men and women in 1974, through almost five decades to last year's ban on single-use plastics, EU law governing such things as anti-discrimination and equality, dignity and respect in the workplace, environment conservation and pollution reduction, economic good practice, data protection, and so much more, have pushed reluctant Irish Governments to do the right thing sooner than they might otherwise have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The principle of free movement which allows Irish citizens to work and travel all over the EU has been a great benefit to millions of Irish people. Our country has been greatly enriched when EU citizens have travelled here. Significant economic benefits have accrued to Ireland as well. Most notably, access to the Single Market and moneys from the Structural Fund did so much to assist our infrastructural development at a time when the Irish economy was something of a poor relation in Europe. It is safe to say that Ireland would be a less developed and less progressive country had we not joined what is now the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> It is also fair to say, however, that it has not all been positive. Being forced to bail out the bondholders during one of our lowest ebbs is a case in point. The increased militarisation of fortress Europe and its consequences for desperate migrants, thousands of whom have died trying to reach our shores, must be regarded as shameful. The bloc's fiscal policy, of course, must also come under the microscope. The goal of the Stability and Growth Pact is to maintain fiscal stability within the Union. The pact's suspension to allow member states to provide unprecedented support throughout the Covid-19 crisis was a tacit acceptance of its limitations. This welcome suspension is also surely evidence of the need for increased flexibility on a more permanent basis. It is not only economic shocks that require fiscal flexibility and the ability to react to circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> It is not news to anyone in this Chamber that Ireland is facing - and has been for several years - a raft of crises in different policy areas, most notably housing and health. We have also committed to taking extraordinary and unprecedented action to reshape our economy and society to meet our international climate-related obligations. I fear that in spite of the obvious need for significant Government intervention in these areas, Ireland - and indeed other countries - will continue to be constrained in its ability to meet the challenge of dealing with these crises. The fiscal rules have been suspended, as we know, until 2024. The reality, however, is that the rules need to be reformed and not reinstated. I hope the EU can learn from its mistakes and live up to the ideals which it claims to profess. Otherwise, we will undoubtedly be doomed to repeat them. I thank the President.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_280">I welcome President von der Leyen to the Dáil and to Ireland. I appreciate her comments about Europe's commitment to ensuring that there will be no hard Border on the island of Ireland or that the exit of Britain from the EU should not in any way adversely impact on the peace on this island. To be honest, nobody out there in the world would thank me if we used this opportunity just to slap each other on the back. With that in mind, I am going to raise some issues in respect of which I think there is concern about and necessary criticism of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> To take up the final point made by Deputy Shortall, we are suffering an absolutely devastating housing and homelessness crisis in this country. What is going on is shameful. I refer to the number of people in emergency accommodation and suffering hardship as a result of this housing crisis. While much of the responsibility lies with successive Governments failing to address it, a large component of the responsibility also lies with the decisions taken by the European Commission and the ECB, as part of the troika, to ram billions worth of austerity down the throats of the people of this country, which has left us with this legacy of an utterly devastating housing crisis. It is long past time that the EU acknowledged its mistakes in imposing that austerity and devastating consequences it has had.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I also note that this week the President has called - I support her in this - for a tribunal to be established to investigate the undoubted war crimes of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. We all condemn the utterly barbaric and murderous invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We support the people of Ukraine in their struggle for self-determination. I must say, however, in the week when there is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, for the President to not call simultaneously for an investigation into the ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed by the apartheid state of Israel against Palestinian people makes me wonder about the consistency of the ethics of the EU's foreign policy. It is utterly unconscionable that we can say, on the one hand, that we must investigate the war crimes and atrocities of Vladimir Putin but remain silent, as the President did when she spoke in June in Israel beside the then Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, and not say a word after we have had two devastating reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on 70 years of ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, apartheid and the siege of Gaza, which was a 15-year long criminal action. Do we talk about investigating the war crimes of Israel? No. Do we sanction Israel for these crimes, as we have sanctioned Russia? No. Instead, we continue to give Israel favoured nation trade status, import great amounts of gas from it, deepen relations with it and engage in considerable military and defence trade with it. This is all with the state that is doing what I described to the Palestinians.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I also find it remarkable when we say that we must break our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, including oil, when, at the same time, we are increasing our imports of Saudi oil. Ironically, Saudi Arabia has this year doubled its imports of Russian oil and is effectively laundering it. We are now importing more oil from the Saudi dictatorship - one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world - which, just like Vladimir Putin, has engaged in a 15-year long war against Yemen that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Leading European states continue to arm that regime. Indeed, Dr. von der Leyen herself, in 2015, went over and signed a defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia when she was Minister of Defence in Germany. If we are to condemn, as we must, the war crimes of Putin, we must simultaneously condemn all war crimes and all crimes against humanity, even when they are committed by people that the European Union perceives as allies, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia or those that arm and support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Finally, in that regard, it is similarly unconscionable when the European courts have found against the EU-Moroccan trade agreement, which involves essentially taking the fish and mineral resources of the occupied Western Sahara people, that the EU Commission has lodged a legal appeal against its own courts in order to continue a trade deal that is robbing the people of Western Sahara of their resources while they are subject to an illegal occupation of their land and territory. President, we must have consistency in our foreign policy, in our ethics and in our morality if we are to be taken seriously as defenders of human rights and opponents of war.</p>

          <p eId="para_287"> I thank the President of the Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, most sincerely for addressing the Oireachtas today marking our 50th year as a member of the European Union. Over those years, Ireland has developed both socially and economically with the assistance of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> As a people, we are proud members of the European family, a relationship that many of us had taken for granted until Brexit challenged it. We must all now redouble our efforts to do what is right for the people on our island and for the citizens of the European Union in finding a practical solution to the current impasse. Since the vote on 23 June 2016, the Commission has stood side by side with Ireland, both in terms of negotiating an agreement with the UK neighbours and in building greater linkages with our continental neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> One of those linkages is the Celtic electricity interconnector, which finally came to fruition last Friday with the Taoiseach leading a delegation to Paris for the signing of the legal agreement for the 700 MW interconnector with France. As the then Minister who engaged with the Commission and the French authorities on this project on behalf of the Irish Government, I formally acknowledge that this vital project would never have happened without the EU Commission's support and that is not only in terms of finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> President von der Leyen, with the dramatic disruption to energy supplies across Europe as a result of the war in Ukraine, we can all now see the need for a far greater level of ambition for electricity interconnection right across Europe if we are to achieve our climate goals and our energy independence. Last December, Dáil Éireann unanimously passed a motion that, among other things, called on the Government to design a strategy in conjunction with the European Commission to construct an Atlantic electricity interconnector that would bring renewable electricity generated off the coast of Ireland to the mainland European grid. We have a 90 million ha maritime resource off our coast - nearly three times the landmass of Germany - providing us with the potential to develop 70 GW of offshore renewable electricity. That is enough capacity, not only to meet our own long-term needs here in Ireland but also to meet the long-term needs of France and Austria. The Atlantic interconnector must only be the first step. We need a pan-European approach to transmission planning facilitating investment in new transmission technologies and constructing electricity superhighways right across the EU, both west to east and south to north. However, the current EU regulation on cross-border transmission planning must be reformed to meet the energy security challenges of the future. I ask the President of the Commission, the Commission and her colleague, the Commissioner, Ms McGuinness, here, to amend our approach to gird development and to create a much larger cross-border pan-European meshed electricity superhighway that will bring solar energy from the south and wind and wave energy from the west right into the heart of Europe providing the EU with reliable clean green European energy.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Tá fíorfháilte roimh Uachtarán an Choimisiúin go dtí Teach Laighean inniu. I welcome the President of the Commission and thank her for her address. Indeed, I thank Dr. von der Leyen for her acknowledgement of the benefits that Europe had to Ireland and, more importantly, the benefits that we brought and gave, and delivered to the European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> On 6 December 1922, 100 years ago, the Irish State officially came into existence. This monumental achievement was the result of a huge sacrifice by generations of our ancestors in order that we as a nation would be at least partially free, sovereign and, indeed, independent. Fifty-one years later, in 1973, our nation joined the EEC. I can remember campaigning for it. We joined to work in union with our friends and neighbours in fellow European countries. We had great hopes and the people welcomed it and voted for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> However, since then, through various treaties, from Maastricht to Amsterdam, to Nice and to Lisbon, which we had to vote twice for - imagine, the first result was not accepted - we have seen much transfer of decision-making which originally rested with sovereign countries to the EU Commission and we have issues of concerns about militarisation and considerable privatisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I certainly have concerns, as have many people, with the way we handled the Covid pandemic and the fact that the Commission was discussing Covid passports, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, long before Covid reached our shores. I am concerned at the way that big pharma have been indemnified, the way that it was favoured and got favouritism, and the way people were locked down and imprisoned and the fear that was created. The narrative could not be questioned by anybody in any country. Goodness, we see that today in China and elsewhere. I have those concerns and I espouse them here to the President of the Commission today.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> As I said, nation states such as ours seem to have handed over their sovereignty to the EU. The erosion of our sovereignty is greatly concerning to the citizens of Ireland. This loss of sovereignty is the reason that our fishing industry has been unceremoniously wiped out; sold out by our own Government. The latest scandal announced is that one third of our fishermen are being forced to decommission their boats permanently. It is shocking. I remember a thriving beet industry in Ireland, in my own county, in Tipperary, in Thurles, and most small farmers had beet. We lost our beet industry; also sold out. This loss of sovereignty is the reason our manufacturing, which took place in every town, village and hamlet in rural Ireland is now gone. Tá sé imithe. Small businesses thrived then but now it is difficult for small business. It is so cumbersome. Our officials and our Government come back from Europe stating it is a European diktat but I do not know did they even question it. Sometimes, we have not even applied for funds to support some of our ailing and struggling businesses. That is the fact of the matter. People are aghast at this because ní neart go cur le chéile is important to the Irish, as is the sense of meitheal, but it has not been there. This loss of sovereignty is the reason the Government tells farmers that they must reduce their herd size while at the same time the EU, which Dr. von der Leyen leads, wants to import more beef from Brazil and elsewhere. It is an act of madness. It is disquieting. It is unfair and it is downright wrong to our farmers. Farming is such an important part of our country and sustained us through several recessions.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> This loss of sovereignty is the reason we were forced to bail out the euro currency, paying the debts of privately-owned banks and financial speculators. In fact, we paid 42% of the total European banking costs, costing €9,000 to every fear, bean agus duine óg. Every man, woman and child had to pay, will pay and is paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">All these bankers and investors, who may have been from President von der Leyen's own country, had bonds and insurance but we were made the patsy to pay them and our Government here voted for it. I voted for it and it was the biggest political mistake I ever made in my life. Did I vote for the bailout? No, I did not. The IMF gave us money at less than 3% and our so-called friends in Europe charged us 6% interest on the money. This is some friendship we voted for.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> What is the end goal of the European Union in terms of member states' sovereignty? I ask this in all sincerity. Will President von der Leyen as President of the European Commission guarantee today to the Irish people that Ireland will remain the free and sovereign country our ancestors fought so bravely to achieve? I come from Tipperary, the land of Breen, Treacy, Robinson and Dinny Lacey who gave their lives. Liam Lynch, a Limerick man, was shot in the adjoining parish to mine. We commemorate these people with pride. Here we are undermining daily what they fought for. I do not know if President von der Leyen knew of Thomas Davis. She quoted the late John Hume, and rightly so. He was a wonderful European and Irish man. Thomas Davis was a man who championed Irish sovereignty. He wrote a famous song in which he expressed the hope that Ireland long a province be a nation once again. The words have inspired many generations of Irish people, young and old. Does the EU want to make our nation a province once again? I ask this in all sincerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> President von der Leyen spoke about climate change and just transition. There is no just transition for people who have been forced to shut down their industries. They are not allowed to keep heat and warmth. President von der Leyen mentioned we are a beacon of light. Yes we were and are, but the candle and flame have been quenched in many homes and houses. We have homeless people and a situation with our healthcare. We have welcomed many Ukrainians from the horrible war. We have limits as to what we can do with regard to migration from all other countries. Some countries in Europe have ceased and put a pause on it. We have to cut our cloth according to our measure. This is Ireland of a thousand welcomes, of course, and President von der Leyen is welcome today, but we need to be respected for who we are, what our are people are and our sovereignty.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">Today's meeting has been organised to celebrate 50 years of our membership of the European Union. I welcome President von der Leyen for this discussion. As a representative of a fishing community in Ireland, this is a sad commemoration because that was the start of the decline of our fishing communities. It was a combination of Government incompetence and the European Union taking advantage of it that has meant we have seen the decline of our fishing across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I express solidarity with the Members who have spoken about the housing crisis we are experiencing in this country. The EU has a sad role in this. It has been aided by the Government of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> In 1972, Ireland was a proud, neutral, unaligned country. I note President von der Leyen said Europe was once a peace project. It was probably telling that she said it was "once" a peace project. Again, with a willing government, the EU will get rid of our neutrality. This is something we should regret in this country. It is something every political Member should oppose to ensure we maintain what has been a proud tradition. It is a tradition of which we should all be very proud and we should send a message to Europe and to the world that neutrality is a way to move forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I join my colleagues in welcoming President von der Leyen in the building in which we have sat for the past 100 years, each year of which has been as a neutral state. The Taoiseach is correct that we have been proud Europeans for 50 years. We have been proud Europeans for much longer than 50 years. It is worth recalling that our initial attempt at accession was blocked as part of the power play between bigger states. For all of our proudness in being Europeans we have been avowedly neutral throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> The Taoiseach paid tribute to Lynch and Hillery who led our accession to the European Union. It is worth recalling that even when our own citizens were under attack by military forces and paramilitary forces backed by a state in a part of our island that we then considered part of our territory, they eschewed a military solution for a diplomatic one. They engaged in quiet diplomacy and not bombast. There is a difference. Their approach was vindicated subsequently. It is easy to fan the flames of war. It is easy to engage in jingoism, but wars very rarely end in unconditional surrender. Instead, they are brought to an end by people who engage in painful and painstaking negotiation with people and forces with whom they profoundly disagree because they believe in the greater goal of peace. I ask that the European Union be a force for peace in the world, as it was founded to be.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">President von der Leyen is welcome to Ireland. As a supporter of the old EEC, I wonder where we are going in the EU. This is for the simple reason that, in my opinion, the European Union is like marriage; it is either love or divorce. People either buy into everything or they do not. I welcome what President von der Leyen said about the UK. We need the UK, especially in the agricultural sector which, unfortunately, has not been mentioned today. I listened to President von der Leyen speak about freedom. Every time we ask a question of any government it tells us it has to ask the EU, whether it is about VAT or tax. No matter what it is, environmental law or whatever, we have to ask the EU whether we can do something. It seems to be our master. We do not have our freedom or our own nationality, unfortunately, if that is the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> President von der Leyen spoke about heritage and tradition. At present, EU law is taking a lot of heritage and tradition away from the people of this country. I know there were benefits to the old EEC. I would never deny that. Unfortunately, if we look at the likes of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the budget has decreased. With the policy being pursued at present by the EU, under the green agenda and the food policy, a country such as Ireland and the EU will end up having food shortages within the next seven to ten years with the agenda being pushed on the agricultural sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">I welcome President von der Leyen most warmly. I want to do her the honour of being brief. At this stage she has heard a vigorous series of exchanges of views from parliamentarians and she can see we cherish our democracy. People have spoken about it being 50 years since we joined the European Union. It is interesting to note that, 50 years ago this very day, the House was in crisis. The Government of Jack Lynch was teetering on the brink of defeat on an issue to do with the terror campaign happening on our island. The Government narrowly survived that night thanks to the Fine Gael Party. I mention this because peace on this island is not to be taken for granted. I also make the point that peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland are not to be taken for granted. The European Union has a huge role to play in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Maroš Šefčovič has gone very far down the road of bringing pragmatism and flexibility to the discussions about the Northern Ireland protocol and its implementation in Northern Ireland regarding the movement of goods. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, complimented President von der Leyen on the support he has received. I ask that the European Union be very flexible, pragmatic and realistic. The danger of increasing sectarian and political tension on the island exists. I know the European Union has the best interests of Ireland at heart. I know that, by showing flexibility and pragmatism in these negotiations, this issue can be put to bed and this country will prosper North and South as a consequence.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I welcome President von der Leyen to the Oireachtas on the 50th anniversary of Ireland's accession to the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">One important early benefit of accession was the impetus it created for more progressive national policies in areas such as gender equality, the environment, employment, ending the marriage bar and the working time directive. That version of Europe, as a collective momentum for the raising of social standards and promotion of fundamental rights, is one which still resonates deeply with citizens in many countries, including Ireland. The introduction of the general data protection regulation was also another positive moment in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Unfortunately, there was a period during austerity when the momentum to which I refer and any long-term, sustainable and inclusive vision for Europe seemed to be cast aside in favour of short-term fiscal targets. Austerity eroded public services, the social fabric and public confidence across the EU, the consequences of which are still being felt. Some learnings have been taken from those mistakes, as reflected in the very different economic and social approach during the recent pandemic. There is much to be praised in the generous and collective European response to the crisis, with the sad exception of the shameful position taken by the EU in blocking and delaying a trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights waiver.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> Another acknowledgement of the need to deepen connection between the people of Europe and its institutions was the holding of the Conference on the Future of Europe recently. I was honoured to be one of four national parliamentarians from Ireland to take part in that process. It was moving to see citizens from different countries share similar concerns and express common desires to make Europe a better, more equal and sustainable place for all to live in. While the citizens emphasised values and rights, it was concerning that some of those in powerful positions seemed more focused on European economic dominance and military strength. It was also interesting how many of the citizens' recommendations reflected issues long-raised by social and environmental NGOs and trade unions - a reminder, perhaps, that the EU should listen more to citizens and civil society and less to corporate lobbyists. The public good must be prioritised over the profit of a few. This is particularly crucial when it comes climate action. We simply cannot afford the dilution of the taxonomy of the due diligence directive and Fit for 55. We cannot afford to remain within the energy charter treaty or investment court structures when we need to deliver ambitious energy and climate policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> Madam President kindly acknowledged the contribution Ireland has made to Europe, and I would suggest our active record of neutrality is part of that contribution. Our neutrality is not something we leave aside to engage with the world. It is the basis for our engagement with the world, a basis that has allowed us to be champions on international law, humanitarian action and to bridge the links between Europe and much of the rest of the world. The importance of peace is crucial in this regard. The President heard the applause for no hard Border on the island of Ireland. It is also important that the EU does not support the creation of hard borders in Africa as part of an immigration control mechanism. The EU, at its best, is like the UN - an example of the possibilities of multilateralism grounded in principles rather than interests. We must not return to big-power politics. I would urge that the honest heart and open mind the president spoke about must turn outwards from the EU towards the world and must not be turned solely inwards towards our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">A Uachtaráin von der Leyen, a Thaoisigh, a Sheanadóirí, a Theachtaí Dála, a dhaoine uaisle. Your Excellency, President von der Leyen, Taoiseach, Deputies, Senators, members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, on behalf of all the citizens of our democracy, I thank you for addressing these Houses to mark 50th anniversary of Ireland’s accession to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Irish membership of the European Union has been one of the most positive events of our lifetimes. The European Union has shown when the nations of Europe work together, it benefits all our citizens. The European Union brings freedom: free movement of goods; free movement of capital; freedom of services; free movement of people. The economic benefits of freedom are clear to be seen throughout this island. The European Union came from the ashes of the Second World War and an alliance for peace among its member nations was formed. It has also been described by you as a peace project.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Next year, those of us on this island will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. This agreement was only possible through the support of our partners in the European Union, the United States of America and the United Kingdom working together. The current impasse will only be solved by us working together again. The European Union’s strong and steadfast support for Ireland, its continuing support for our peace process and the hard-won peace on the island, as well as in the negations following the Brexit referendum, are greatly appreciated by the Members of this Parliament and the people on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> President von der Leyen, your presence in our Parliament is a sign of your solidarity with us and with the people of this island. Your support is appreciated; your support in the past has been appreciated, and your support in the future will be greatly appreciated. A Uachtaráin von der Leyen, go raibh maith agat.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">In page 4, lines 8 to 14, to delete all words from and including “purpose—” in line 8, down to and including line 14 and substitute the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I wish to put on the record of the House that following the Second Stage of this Bill which, thankfully, everybody thought was a good idea, I met with the Minister of State and the officials and I must state that there were so kind and accommodating to me and Senators Chambers and Pauline O'Reilly. They gave us sterling advice as to what was wrong with the Bill in the nicest possible way. The amendments here, therefore, are to take out some of the things which have been problematic for the passage of this Bill and are probably not central to the Bill either. I am aware, as I am sure the Minister of State is, that there is another issue with the Bill but I have missed the deadline of taking that amendment out. I am aware then that the Minister of State will highlight that point and I thank him for doing so. I would also expect that that aspect will be amended when the Bill comes before the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I am very pleased that this has happened, and that it will, please God, pass all Stages in the Seanad today with everybody's support. I thank the Minister of State, in particular, his team and all of his officials for making this a reality. If I can be then, as cheeky as I probably normally am, I ask for as early as possible a slot in the Dáil to make this Bill a reality in order that it goes on to the statute books in whatever shape or form the Minister of State feels he will take it in before the Dáil.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-01T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_325">I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach. I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad this afternoon on behalf of the Minister for Justice. I begin by thanking Senators Doherty, Chambers and Pauline O'Reilly for bringing forward this important Private Members' Bill on character references in sexual offences trials and thank the Senators for supporting this Bill. Earlier this week, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, brought a memo to Government seeking Cabinet approval to support the passage of this Bill through the Seanad, as well as the amendments which have been tabled by the sponsoring Senators today on Committee Stage. I am happy to confirm that approval was granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Before I speak to the amendments, I would like to outline the position of the Government on this Private Members' Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The Bill provides that character references during sentencing in sexual offences trials should be sworn under oath or affidavit. This is intended to prevent unvouched character evidence being presented in sentencing in sexual offence trials, without cross-examination by the prosecutor, or the victim and their legal representatives, being possible. The overall intentions of this Private Members' Bill are in line with work underway in the Department of Justice to improve how victims of sexual crime experience the criminal justice system. We are very supportive measures which protect the victim from retraumatisation, in line with initiatives underway to improve the situation of victims through the plan supporting the victim's journey.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The Government supports the Bill's aim of requiring character references in sexual offences trials to be sworn under oath or affidavit and officials from my Department has had productive discussions with the sponsoring Senators in reiterating this shared objective. This key aspect of the Bill will ensure that anyone who wishes to provide a character reference for a person who has been convicted of a sexual offence will now have to stand over their words.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> However, as I highlighted in the House on Second Stage, there are both legal and operational issues around providing for separate legal representation for victims during a sentencing hearing. In this context, I welcome the Senator's amendments which addressed the concerns I had raised. The amendments tabled remove entitlement of victims or their families to legal representation during a sentencing hearing. In Ireland's common law system, the criminal trial comprises of a binary contest between the prosecution and defence. The procedural and evidential rules, including those at sentencing stage, which have evolved over time, are based on that assumption. Under both the Constitution of Ireland and the European Convention on Human Rights, there must be equality of arms, insofar as that can be achieved, between the accused and the prosecution. By accepting the Senator's proposed amendments we are maintaining this well-established balance which is a cornerstone of our legal system. </p>
          <p eId="para_330"> We also avoid potentially significant constitutional issues which the introduction of separate legal representation for one category of witness would entail. As previously noted in this House, the financial implications of providing for separate legal representation for victims or their families at sentencing hearings would have been considerable. We also avoid the risk of increasing waiting times for non-priority matters in law centres, and the unintended consequence of this practice might need for it to be extended to all types of criminal cases, which was the concern raised by the Legal Aid Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> In this context, I would note that experts in this area examined the issue of legal representation for victims during criminal trials and came to similar conclusions. Along with an expert group, Professor Tom O'Malley consider this very carefully in the review of protections for vulnerable witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. The O'Malley review made very limited recommendations in respect of expanding legal representation for victims and those recommendations are being implemented in the sexual offences Bill which is currently under preparation in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> Justice Peter Charleton came to similar conclusions in a recent essay on improving the criminal trial process for victims of sexual offences. </p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The Director of Public Prosecutions and her representatives are tasked by law with prosecuting all crime which has been committed against a victim. To introduce separate legal representation for the victim would create a fundamental and profound imbalance in this binary system. </p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Some consequential amending of related provisions in this Private Members' Bill which allowed the victim or a family member to question someone providing character reference will need to be addressed at a later date as the Bill progresses through the Dáil. There is no difficulty with the prosecution doing so and let me be clear about that. However, permitting character evidence to be questioned by persons other than the prosecution and defence teams would again give rise to serious legal and constitutional issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Victims should be accorded every reasonable consideration during the course of criminal trials, bearing in mind what is constitutionally permissible. The Department of Justice is deeply committed to moving towards a criminal justice system which is more victim-centred. In supporting a victim's journey, the plan to implement the recommendations of the O'Malley review is to implement important reforms to support and protect vulnerable victims in sexual offence cases to ensure this. This Private Members' Bill complements those processes and I reiterate the Government's support for its core aim, which is to make character evidence vouchable. This is a key step we can take to help protect victims from retraumatisation in the court experience. I once again offer my appreciation to the Senators for this initiative and my Department stands ready to advise on further amendments which may be needed to support passage of this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas. I agree with Senator Doherty that we should try to progress this matter now as quickly as possible from here. I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach.</p>
